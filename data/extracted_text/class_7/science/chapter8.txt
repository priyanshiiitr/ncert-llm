Prerna and her younger sister are watching a sports channel 
on television. Prerna enjoys running and she has been declared 
the fastest runner among the girls in her district for winning 
the 100 metre sprint at an interschool competition held at the 
district level. She is now training to compete at the state level. 
She dreams of representing India at the international level in 100 
metre sprint contests in future. 
While watching the rerun of sprints at the Olympic games held 
in the past, Prerna is always amazed that the measurement of 
the time taken for the race is so advanced that they could identify 
the winner even when two sprinters seemed to cross the ﬁ nish 
line almost together. However, in her school, the sports teacher 
only used a special kind of watch called a ‘stopwatch’ for timing 
the school races. She had noticed her mother wearing a watch on 
her wrist and her sister looking at her mobile phone when she 
needed to check the time. Her uncle used a Braille watch and had 
recently acquired a talking watch that announced the time at the 
touch of a button. There was also a large clock on the wall near 
the school entrance. Her thoughts turned to people in the ancient 
past, who did not have the modern gadgets we have today and 
she wondered…

8.1 Measurement of Time
Humans got interested in keeping track of time long ago. They 
started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves 
after deﬁ nite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting 
of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. 
They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. 
First, they devised calendars. A day was deﬁ ned by the cycle of 
rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to ﬁ nd ways 
of knowing the time of day. 
How 
was 
time 
measured when there 
were no clocks and 
watches?
So, they made many devices which 
helped them to measure smaller intervals 
of time within a day. Some of these were 
sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and 
candle clocks. 
In a sundial, time is determined with 
the changing position of the shadow of an 
object cast by the light of the Sun during 
the day (Fig. 8.1).
The water clocks used the ﬂ ow of water 
out or into a vessel to measure time. In 
one type, water ﬂ owed out from a vessel 
which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a). In 
the other type, there would be a bowl, with 
a ﬁ ne hole at the bottom, which was 
ﬂ oated on the surface of water (Fig. 8.2b). 
It gradually ﬁ lled up in a ﬁ xed time and 
ﬁ nally sank. Then, it was lifted up and 
ﬂ oated again. 
In an hourglass (Fig. 8.3), time was 
measured on the basis of the ﬂ ow of sand 
from one bulb to another.
Candle clocks (Fig. 8.4) were candles 
with markings that indicated the passage 
of time when burned.

Cut it into two, roughly in the middle as shown in Fig. 8.5a.
Using a drawing pin, make a small hole in the cap of the 
bottle (Fig. 8.5b).

Place the upper part of the bottle in an inverted position over 
the lower half (Fig. 8.5c).
Fill the upper part of the bottle with water. You may add a 
few drops of ink or colour to make the water level easily 
visible (Fig. 8.5d). 
The water will start dripping into the lower part of the bottle. 
Using a watch, mark the level of water after every one minute 
till all the water drips down.
Your water clock is ready. Can you now guess how to use it? 
Pour the water from the lower part back into the top part and 
watch the level of water dripping into the lower part. Every time 
it touches a mark made by you, one more minute has passed.
FASCINATING FACTS
The world’s largest stone sundial, 
the Samrat Yantra, was built 
around 300 years ago at the Jantar 
Mantar, 
in 
Jaipur, 
Rajasthan, 
a UNESCO World Heritage site 
that houses several astronomical 
instruments. With its imposing 
height of 27 metres, its shadow 
moves at about 1 millimetre per 
second and falls on a scale ﬁ nely marked to measure time intervals as 
short as 2 seconds. Like any sundial, it measures local or ‘solar time’, 
requiring a correction to determine Indian Standard Time.

FASCINATING FACTS
In ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water 
clocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement 
appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised 
between the second century BCE – third century CE). An accurate 
expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was 
given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water 
ﬂ owing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, 
and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very 
accurate because as water levels dropped, the ﬂ ow rate decreased. 
This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock 
(Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, ﬁ rst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then 
in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly 
with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town 
squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, 
conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was 
progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth 
century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals.

As human civilisation advanced, and 
as people began to travel long distances, 
the measurement of time became very 
critical. This led to the development of 
increasingly better mechanical devices 
for the measurement of time, driven 
by weights, gears, and springs from the 
fourteenth century onwards. However, 
the invention of the pendulum clock 
in the seventeenth century marked 
a major breakthrough in mechanical 
timekeeping.
KNOW A SCIENTIST
The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by 
Christiaan Huygens (1629 –1695). He was inspired by the investigations 
of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642). It is said that once while 
sitting in a church, Galileo’s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended 
from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse 
to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for 
each swing. After experimenting with diﬀ erent pendulums, Galileo 
concluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always 
the same for a pendulum of a given length.

A

pendulum 
consists 
of 
a 
small 
metallic ball (called the 
bob of the pendulum) 
suspended from a rigid 
support by a long thread 
as shown in Fig. 8.7a.

Bob 
The pendulum at rest is in its mean position. When the bob of 
the pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts 
oscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it 
repeats its path after a ﬁ xed interval of time. 
The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when 
its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme 
position A, changes direction and moves to another extreme 
position B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The 
pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves 
from one extreme position A to another extreme position B and 
comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete 
one oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a 
pendulum and measure its time period.
Activity 8.2: Let us experiment
Collect a piece of string around 150 cm long, a heavy metal 
ball with hook/ a stone (bob), a stopwatch/ watch, and a ruler.
Tie the bob at one end of the string. 
Fix the other end of the string to a rigid support such that the 
length of the string in between support and bob is around 
100 cm. 
Wait for the bob to come to rest. Your pendulum is now 
ready.
We did an activity in the chapter 
‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ 
in the Grade 6 Science textbook 
Curiosity, where we observed the 
oscillatory motion of an eraser hung 
with a thread. Is the pendulum 
similar to that?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Gently hold the bob, move it slightly to one side and release 
it. Take care not to push the bob while releasing it and that 
the string is taut. Is your pendulum now oscillating?
Using a watch, measure the time it takes for the pendulum 
to complete 10 oscillations. Record the time in Table 8.1.
Repeat this activity 3–4 times.
Divide the time taken for 10 oscillations by 10 to calculate
the time period of your pendulum. Note it down in Table 8.1.

Is the time period of your pendulum almost the same every 
time? What do you conclude from this observation? The time 
period of the pendulum is almost the same every time.
THINK LIKE A SCIENTIST!
You just did an important historical experiment which was ﬁ rst done 
by Galileo, except you used a watch to measure time in place of your 
pulse beat. Suppose you were Galileo experimenting with pendulums, 
what all would you investigate? What questions could you ask? Would 
all pendulums have the same time period? How would you test this? 
Repeat Activity 8.2 using the same bob but with pendulums of two 
or three diﬀ erent lengths. Does the time period change? If so, how does 
the length aﬀ ect it? If changing the length inﬂ uences the time period, 
does the bob’s mass also matter? Test this by repeating Activity 8.2 
with a ﬁ xed pendulum length but with bobs of diﬀ erent mass. Do you 
observe any change?
The time period of a simple pendulum depends on its length but 
not on the bob’s mass. All pendulums of the same length have the same 
time period at a given location.

The time period of a simple pendulum of a given length is

time. 
Measurement of Time and Motion
All clocks, old or modern, are based on some process repeating 
continuously, which can be used to mark equal intervals of time. 
Modern clocks measure time using the same basic principle — 
periodically repeating processes — but use tiny and very rapid 
vibrations either from a quartz crystal (quartz clocks) or from some 
speciﬁ c atoms (atomic clocks). While Huygens’ early pendulum 
clocks could gain or lose 10 seconds each day, today’s atomic clocks 
are so precise that they lose only one second in millions of years! 
Scientists are constantly searching for even better ways to measure 
time with greater accuracy.

The SI unit of time is the second. Its symbol is s. The larger units 
of time are minute (min) and hour (h).
60 s = 1 min
60 min = 1 h
Units of time, such as second, minute, and hour begin with a 
lowercase letter, except at the beginning of a sentence. Their 
symbols ‘s’, ‘min’, and ‘h’ are also written in lowercase letters 
and in singular. Note that a full stop is not written after the 
symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the time, 
always leave a space between the number and the unit. Also, 
note that writing ‘sec’ for second and ‘hrs’ for hour is incorrect.

The hole in the bowl of Ghatika-yantra was made in such a manner 
that it took 24 minutes to ﬁ ll and sink. The time unit measured by this 
clock was called ghatika or ghati. It became the standard unit of time 
measurement and continued until the end of the nineteenth century. 
A 24-hour-long day was, thus, divided into 60 equal ghatis.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
In today’s world, measuring tiny fractions of a second is very 
important! For example, in sports, timekeeping devices can 
record events down to one-hundredth or even one-thousandth of 
a second (a millisecond) to determine the winners in a race. In 
medicine, heart monitors like Electrocardiogram (ECG) machines 
measure the millisecond variations in heartbeats to detect health 
issues. In music, digital recordings capture sound thousands of 
times per second for smooth playback. Many devices use even 
shorter intervals, smartphones, and computers process signals 
in microseconds (one-millionth of a second), allowing them 
to operate very fast. Scientists continue to develop even more 
precise time-measuring tools for space exploration, medicine, and 
advanced science experiments. The faster and more accurate our 
clocks become, the more they help society in ways we may not 
even notice!

For races covering the same 
distance, we can tell who was 
faster by measuring time. But how 
can we tell that when comparing 
races for diﬀ erent distances?
8.2 Slow or Fast
What do we mean when we say something is moving fast or 
slow? Suppose you are watching a 100 metre race on a straight 
track. All the players begin from the starting line together but 
after sometime they are not running together (Fig. 8.10). How do 
you decide who is running faster amongst them? 
Fig. 8.9: A wall clock
Activity 8.3: Let us identify
Look at the wall clock shown in Fig. 8.9 carefully. 
What is the smallest interval of time you can 
measure with it? 
One second is the smallest interval of time that we can 
measure using this clock.
Measurement of Time and Motion
Fig. 8.10: Boys running a race on a straight track
Someone who is ahead of others at some instant of time, is 
running faster than them. Hence, someone who has covered 
more distance within the same time is running faster.
The distances moved by objects in a given interval of time 
decide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster 
runner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the 
word ‘speed’. 
8.3 Speed
p
By comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a 
unit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The 
unit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call 
the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of 
the object.
How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be 
calculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object 
and the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total 
distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus,
Speed = Total distance covered
 
Total time taken
What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of 
length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of 
speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. 
Speed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the 
distance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is 
kilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.

8.3.1 Relationship between speed, distance, 
and time
We already know how to calculate speed using 
Speed = Total distance covered
 
Total time taken
if the distance travelled and time taken for it are known to us.
We can write this equation in a diﬀ erent form to calculate the 
distance covered by an object, if we know its speed and the time 
taken, by using 
Total distance covered = Speed × Total time taken
Similarly, we can also calculate the time an object will take to 
cover a distance, if the distance and speed are given, by using
Total time taken = Total distance covered
 
       
 
      Speed
Example 8.2: Raghav is going to a neighbouring city in a bus 
moving at a speed of 50 km/h. If it takes him 2 h to reach that 
city, how far is that city?
Solution: Distance covered by bus = Speed × Time
                                                               = 50 km
h ×2h
                                                              = 100 km
Example 8.3: A train is travelling at a speed of 90 km/h. How 
much time will it take to cover a distance of 360 km? 
Solution: Time taken by the train = Distance covered
Speed
                                                             = 
360km

                                                             = 4 h
In all the examples so far, we have found the speed of an 
object by using ‘the total distance covered divided by the total 
time taken’. However, the object might not have travelled with 
the same speed during the entire duration of time. The object 
might have sometimes moved slower or sometimes faster. So, the 
speed that we have calculated is the average speed, but, in this 
book, we have used the term ‘speed’ for ‘average speed’.

I once watched a part of marathon on a straight 
road stretch. I noticed that some people seemed to 
be running at the same speed during that distance 
while some people would speed up or slow down. 
How were their motion diﬀ erent?
8.4 Uniform and Non-uniform Linear Motion
Do you remember learning about linear motion in the chapter 
‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity? When an object moves along a straight line, 
its motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a 
track which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway 
stations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is 
an example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the 
ﬁ rst station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then 
slows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between 
the two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a 
constant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed.

Measurement of Time and Motion
An object moving along a straight line with a constant speed 
is said to be in uniform linear motion. So, the train is in uniform 
motion between B and C (Fig. 8.11). On the other hand, if the speed 
of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said 
to be in non-uniform linear motion. The motion of the train 
between A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform 
(Fig. 8.11).
An object in uniform linear motion covers equal distances 
in equal intervals of time, while it covers unequal distances in 
equal intervals of times when it is in non-uniform linear motion. 
In Table 8.3, data are given for the distances travelled by two 
trains, X and Y, between the time 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

Which of the two trains is in uniform linear motion between 
10:00 AM and 11:00 AM? Train X covers equal distances in equal 
intervals of time, so it is in uniform linear motion while Train Y 
is in non-uniform linear motion.
Uniform linear motion is an idealisation. In everyday life, 
we seldom ﬁ nd objects moving with a constant speed over long 
distances or for long intervals of time. That is why we have to use 
average speeds.

continue in the future. We cannot see or feel time but we 
can only measure its passage in terms of a time interval 
between events. These time intervals can be fractions of 
a second, or even days or months, or years or centuries. 
We can only say when an event occurred or for how 
long it lasted. Though we have learnt to measure time 
with increasing accuracy, and our lives are governed 
by watches and clocks, ‘What is time?’ continues to be a 
tricky question with no easy answer!
