If your food is fully digested before you eat again, you won’t need medicine for pain.
(Thirukkural 942)
In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living 
Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, we learnt about 
processes essential for survival of living beings like nutrition, 
respiration, excretion, and reproduction. These are collectively 
called life processes. In this chapter, we will learn about life 
processes such as nutrition and respiration in detail.

Observe your surroundings and notice what animals eat. 
Animals eat diﬀ erent types of food. Bees and sunbirds suck the nectar 
of ﬂ owers, while infants of humans and many other animals feed on 
their mother’s milk. Snakes, like python, swallow the animals they 
prey upon. Some aquatic animals ﬁ lter tiny food particles ﬂ oating 
nearby and feed upon them. 
Animals, 
including 
humans, 
obtain 
energy from food, which enables them to 
carry out various life processes. Animals 
consume 
food 
that 
contains 
complex 
components, such as carbohydrate, protein, 
and fat. These complex food components 
have to be broken down into simpler forms 
before the body can use them. But how does 
this process happen? 
Breaking 
down 
of 
complex 
food 
components into simpler forms occurs in a 
long tube called the alimentary canal. This 
process starts in the mouth and ends at the 
anus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this 
canal, digestive juices secreted at diﬀ erent 
parts break it down into simpler forms. 
This simpler form of food is absorbed by 
diﬀ erent parts of our alimentary canal and 
transported to various parts of our body to 
carry out various functions.
9.1 Nutrition in Animals  
How do the complex food components get broken down into 
simpler forms and used by the body in various animals? Is this 
process the same in all animals or does it vary? Let us ﬁ rst try to 
understand this process in humans.
9.1.1 Digestion in human beings
Let us trace the journey of food inside our body as it passes 
through diﬀ erent parts of the alimentary canal.
Beginning with the mouth cavity
The journey of the food you eat begins when it enters your 
mouth. Your teeth break down food you eat into smaller pieces 
by the processes of crushing and chewing. This process of initial 
breakdown of food into ﬁ ne pieces is called mechanical digestion. 
Think about your favourite food. Does your mouth feel watery?

This happens because of more saliva that gets released when you 
recall your favourite food.
What do you think is the role of saliva in your mouth? What 
do you feel when you eat other types of food, such as chapati? Let 
us ﬁ nd out.
Take a small piece of chapati or a bite-sized portion of boiled 
rice and chew it properly for 30–60 seconds. At ﬁ rst, the chapati
or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you 
notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you 
ever wondered why this happens?
Chapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. 
Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch 
into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes 
sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break 
down components of food into simpler ones.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
A healthy mouth requires good oral hygiene. We should brush our 
teeth and clean our tongue twice a day, and rinse our mouth with 
water after each meal to prevent tooth decay and bad smell in the 
mouth. Find out the ways our elders were maintaing oral hygiene. 
Activity 9.1: Let us investigate
Take two test tubes and label them as ‘A’ and ‘B’. 
Take one teaspoonful of boiled rice in test tube A, and take a 
teaspoonful of boiled rice after chewing it for 30–60 seconds 
in test tube B. 
Add 3–4 mL of water in both the test tubes. 
Note the initial colour of the rice-water mixture in Table 9.1.
Add 3–4 drops of iodine solution into each test tube with the 
help of a dropper. Mix the content of each test tube separately 
and observe. 
Record your observations in Table 9.1.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Did you observe that the colour of boiled rice turned blue-black 
in test tube A, while in test tube B, chewed boiled rice either did 
not change colour or turned only a very light blue-black colour? 
What causes the change of colour in test tube A? In Grade 6, we 
learned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with 
starch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour 
indicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains 
chewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates 
that the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight 
change in colour, it indicates that starch is present only in very 
small amount. It has been broken down into simple sugars by 
the action of saliva. If the colour still appears in test tube B, what 
changes would you make in the activity to explore it further? 
Would the colour change if chewing time is increased? Try to 
ﬁ nd out by repeating the activity.
Now, we know that saliva secretion in the mouth helps break 
down starch into sugars. This process of breaking complex food 
components into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food 
is partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially 
digested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal. 
Food pipe (Oesophagus): A passage from the mouth to the 
stomach
When you chew your food, your 
saliva not only helps in digesting 
the starch but also moistens 
it, making it soft and easy to 
swallow. Your tongue helps in 
mixing chewed food with saliva 
and pushing this softened food 
into a long, ﬂ exible tube called 
the food pipe or oesophagus
(Fig. 9.2). But how does the food 
move down? 
The walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a 
wave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This 
movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and 
pushes the food forward.
Stomach
In the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The 
churned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining 
of the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice, 
acid, and mucus.

Life Processes in Animals
The digestive juice of the stomach breaks 
down proteins present in the food into simpler 
components. 
The acid not only helps break down proteins 
but also kills many harmful bacteria. The mucus 
protects the stomach lining from the acid, preventing 
damage. In the stomach, the food is partially digested 
and transformed into a semi-liquid mass, preparing 
it for the next stage of digestion.

FASCINATING FACTS
How did scientists learn about digestion in the human body?
The discovery of how the stomach works happened 
by chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin 
was accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated 
by a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound 
never fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole. 
This opening allowed Dr. Beaumont to observe 
digestion in the stomach as it happened. He conducted 
experiments on how diﬀ erent foods were broken 
down and studied how emotions aﬀ ect digestion.
Alexis St. Martin’s 
shotgun wound
Small Intestine
After its journey through the stomach, the partially 
digested food moves into the small intestine. Look 
at Fig. 9.4. It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary 
canal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised 
that although it is called small intestine, it is almost 
6 metres long—almost twice the height of your 
classroom! You will be surprised to know that the 
small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary 
canal. 
The small intestine receives digestive secretions 
from three sources—the inner lining of the small 
intestine itself, and two more structures associated 
with the alimentary canal—the liver and the 
pancreas (Fig. 9.4). The liver secretes bile, which 
is mildly basic in nature. Recall the neutralisation 
reaction in chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, 
Basic, and Neutral’. Bile neutralises acids present 
in the food moving down from the stomach and 
breaks down fats into tiny droplets, making its 
digestion easier.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice, which is also 
basic in nature and helps neutralise acids present in the food. 
Additionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates, 
proteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the 
small intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially 
digested carbohydrates into simpler forms. 
The digested nutrients pass on 
from the small intestine into the blood 
present in blood vessels found in the 
walls of the small intestine. This process 
is called absorption of nutrients. How 
are these nutrients absorbed from 
the small intestine? The inner lining 
of the small intestine is thin and has 
thousands of ﬁ nger-like projections 
(Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface 
area for eﬃ  cient nutrient absorption. 
These ﬁ nger-like projections allow 
the digested nutrients to pass into the 
blood, which carries them to diﬀ erent parts of the body. These 
nutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help 
the body function properly.

Large intestine
After most of the nutrients are digested and absorbed in the 
small intestine, what happens to the undigested food? It moves 
into the large intestine. The large intestine is about 1.5 metres 
in length. It is shorter than the small intestine. Then why is it 
called the large intestine? The reason is that it is wider than the 
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Celiac disease is a condition in which the body reacts 
to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. 
This reaction damages the inner lining of the small 
intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. As a result, 
the intestine cannot function properly. The only way 
to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain 
gluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good 
alternatives because they are naturally gluten-free.
Life Processes in Animals
small intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and some salts 
from the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This 
semi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the 
lower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the 
body is ready to get rid of it. Eating ﬁ bre-rich foods like fruits, 
vegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function 
properly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled 
through the anus—a process known as egestion. This is how your 
body removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy!
Isn’t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing 
nutrients from food and eliminating waste?
FASCINATING FACTS
The large intestine contains various small living organisms, 
such as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our 
digestive system healthy. They break down undigested food, 
especially ﬁ bre, and produce essential nutrients. Fibre-rich 
food, and especially ‘fermented foods’ (like curd, buttermilk, 
shrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for 
a healthy digestive system and overall well-being.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
The importance of digestion in maintaining good health has been 
recognised for centuries. The  Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic 
text, highlights the role of easily digestible foods and the judicious use 
of spices like ginger, black pepper, and cumin to enhance digestion. 
Advances in science in the area of nutrition also emphasise eating 
meals at proper timings, practising mindful eating, and avoiding 
overeating as key factors in maintaining digestive health.
9.1.2  Do all animals digest food the same way as 
humans do?
I have seen cows keep chewing 
the food even when they are 
not actively grazing or eating 
anything. Why?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Grass-eating animals, such as 
cows (Fig. 9.6) and buﬀ aloes, 
partially 
chew 
the 
grass 
and swallow it into their 
stomachs. In the stomach, 
partial digestion of the food 
takes place. The partially 
digested food is brought back 
to the mouth for gradual 
chewing. 
This 
process 
is 
called rumination, and these 
animals are called ruminants. 
A cow spends about 8 hours a 
day just chewing the food! The 
thoroughly chewed food again 
passes down the alimentary 
canal for further digestion.

Birds do not have teeth, 
but they have a chamber 
called a gizzard (Fig. 9.7). 
Food is broken down by the 
contraction and relaxation 
of the walls of the gizzard, 
often with the help of grit 
(small stones) that the birds 
swallow.
This shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure 
and function of the alimentary canal to adapt to diﬀ erent ways 
of digesting diﬀ erent kinds of food. 
We have learnt that the nutrients from digested food are 
carried to diﬀ erent parts of the body. Some of the nutrients help 
build and repair the body, while others, like sugar, are broken 
down inside the body to release energy. The process by which 
nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration. 
Let us now explore how this process occurs in animals.
9.2 Respiration in Animals
p
We learnt in Grade 6 chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their 
Characteristics’, that all living beings respire. Is the process of 
respiration the same in all animals? Let us ﬁ rst understand the 
process of respiration in humans.
Life Processes in Animals
9.2.1 Respiration in humans
You know that we breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale) air 
continuously to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. How 
is this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration 
diﬀ erent? Let us ﬁ nd out. 
How do we breathe?
The process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing. It is 
diﬃ  cult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or 
two, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a 
few minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not 
just humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we 
breathe? 
Just as food follows a speciﬁ c pathway in the digestive system, 
our body also has a speciﬁ c system for breathing and respiration. 
This system is called respiratory system. The respiratory 
system consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this 
system, the exchange of gases follows a speciﬁ c pathway. The 
pathway through which the air is inhaled and exhaled involves 
various parts of the respiratory system assisting in the process of 
breathing and respiration.
The respiratory system begins with a pair 
of nasal openings called nostrils through 
which we inhale and exhale air (Fig. 9.8). 
The inhaled air passes into a pair of small 
passages called the nasal passages. Have 
you noticed tiny hair inside your nostrils? 
These hair, along with mucus, help trap 
dust and dirt from the air we breathe in. 
This is why we should breathe through the 
nose and not through the mouth. From the 
nasal passages, the air reaches our lungs 
through the windpipe. The windpipe forms 
two branches, which enter the two lungs. 
In the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and 
ﬁ ner branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli 
(Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
While a lot of the dust is ﬁ ltered out from the inhaled air, often 
small infectious particles can get through the lungs. For example, 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus aﬀ ected 
the respiratory system, leading to breathing diﬃ  culties and 
often causing serious lung problems.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Let us understand the mechanism of breathing by making a 
simple model.
Activity 9.2: Let us make a model 
Take a wide transparent plastic 
bottle with a lid. Remove its 
bottom. 
Make a hole in the lid of the bottle. 
Take a Y-shaped hollow tube, as 
shown in Fig. 9.9. 
Fix two deﬂ ated balloons to the 
forked end of the tube. Secure 
them with rubber bands to make 
them airtight. 
Insert the straight end of the tube 
tightly through the lid from the 
open base of the bottle and seal 
the lid with clay to make it airtight. 
To the open base of the bottle, attach a thin rubber sheet 
tightly using a large rubber band.
Pull the rubber sheet from the centre of the base downwards 
and watch the balloons (Fig. 9.9a). What do you observe? Now, 
release the rubber sheet upwards and observe the balloons 
(Fig. 9.9b). What changes do you see in the balloons? When you 
pull the rubber sheet downwards, the balloons inﬂ ate. Conversely, 
when you release the rubber sheet upwards, the balloons deﬂ ate.
When 
you 
breathe 
in 
(inhale), 
your 
chest 
expands as the ribs move 
up 
and 
outwards. 
The 
diaphragm (a dome-shaped 
muscle below the lungs) 
moves downwards during 
inhalation (Fig. 9.10a). This 
increases the space inside 
the chest, and air enters the 
lungs. When you breathe 
out (exhale), the ribs move 
down and inwards, and the 
diaphragm moves upwards 
(Fig. 9.10b), reducing space 
and pushing air out of 
the lungs.

To be demonstrated by the teacher 
Take an equal amount of freshly 
prepared lime water in two

In test tube A, pass the air using 
a syringe/pichkari (Fig. 9.11a). 
This is the same air that you 
inhale.
In test tube B, repeatedly blow 
air through your mouth into 
the lime water using a straw 
(Fig. 9.11b).
Do you observe any changes in the colour of the lime water? 
The lime water in test tube B turns milky (or cloudy), but the lime 
water in test tube A does not. What does this indicate? Lime water 
turns milky when it reacts with carbon dioxide. Therefore, this 
indicates that the exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than 
the air we inhale.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Breathing Practices for a Healthy Life
Breathing exercises have been practised across diﬀ erent cultures 
in India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for 
improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration. 
In Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing, 
a technique that improves lung function and 
helps keep the body warm even in cold weather. 
Similarly, deep breathing techniques are used to 
promote well-being. Some traditions combine deep 
breathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath 
control to enhance relaxation and mental clarity.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
How does the exchange of gases 
happen?
Through the process of breathing, 
fresh air from outside enters the 
lungs and ﬁ lls the alveoli. The alveoli 
have thin walls surrounded by ﬁ ne 
tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). 
Blood carries carbon dioxide from 
the body to the alveoli, where it is 
released into the air. At the same 
time, oxygen from the alveoli passes 
into the blood and is transported to 
all parts of the body. 
Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you 
energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we 
breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple 
substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose 
to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word 
equation of the process of respiration is as follows—
Glucose + Oxygen 
 Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy
During 
breathing, 
we 
inhale 
air 
from 
our surroundings and 
exhale air having more 
carbon 
dioxide 
than 
the inhaled air. Note 
that not all the oxygen 
is used up (Fig. 9.13). 
Some 
other 
animals 
can 
use 
a 
larger 
fraction of the oxygen 
during 
respiration. 
This exchange of gases 
ensures 
that 
each 
segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove 
waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and 
removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break 
down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, 
play, and even think!
Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical 
process that occurs inside the body. Both the processes are 
essential for our survival!

Life Processes in Animals
Our body has a unique system for the transport of nutrients, 
oxygen, and other substances. This system is called the circulatory 
system. It includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The heart 
pumps blood through blood vessels, ensuring the transport of 
nutrients, oxygen, and other substances to all parts of the body, 
while waste products are carried away.

SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Smoking is extremely harmful to health. It damages the lungs and 
increases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and 
other respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and 
frequent infections.
 In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic 
chemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers 
inhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which 
can be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and 
the elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both 
personal health and the well-being of those around us.
9.2.2  Do other animals breathe the same way as 
humans do?
You have learnt that diﬀ erent animals 
live in diﬀ erent habitats. You may have 
observed birds ﬂ ying and ﬁ sh swimming. 
How do they breathe? Animals, such 
as birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats, 
lizards, and snakes, breathe through 
their lungs. Although all these animals 
have lungs, the structure of their lungs 
are quite diﬀ erent. Most aquatic animals 
like ﬁ sh, have specialised structures 
known as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are 
richly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and 
carbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in 
water takes place across the gills. 
Amphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water. They 
use diﬀ erent body parts for breathing at various stages of their 
life. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs 
use lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when 
they stay in water. This adaptation helps them survive both in 
water and on land, showing how animals have adapted over time 
to diﬀ erent environments. Earthworms use their moist skin for 
the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. 
Gills

Thus, diﬀ erent animals have diﬀ erent breathing mechanisms 
to suit their unique habitats. Apart from the digestive system, the 
respiratory system, and the circulatory system, there are other 
systems which work in coordination with each other in the body 
and perform diﬀ erent functions to sustain life. You will study 
about them in higher grades.
In a Nutshell
Life processes such as nutrition, circulation, respiration, 
excretion, and reproduction are essential for the survival 
of living beings. These processes are collectively called life 
processes.
The human digestive system consists of an alimentary canal 
which includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small 
intestine, large intestine, and anus, and its associated parts, 
the liver and the pancreas. 
The digested food is primarily absorbed through the walls of 
the small intestine. 
The  nutrients absorbed are distributed through the blood 
to diﬀ erent parts of the body where they are used for 
performing various functions. 
The large intestine absorbs most of the remaining water and 
some salts from the undigested food.
Grass-eating animals such as cows and goats are called 
ruminants. They chew the food partially and swallow it. 
Later, the partially digested food is returned to the mouth, 
and the animal chews it thoroughly. 
Breathing involves the movement of air into the lungs 
(inhalation) and out of the lungs (exhalation).
The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the 
alveoli of the lungs.
Respiration uses oxygen from inhaled air to break down 
glucose into carbon dioxide and water. The process by which 
nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration.
The circulatory system transports nutrients  and oxygen to 
all parts of the body. It includes the heart, which  pumps 
blood through blood vessels, delivering oxygen and nutrients 
while also removing waste from the body.
Breathing is a physical process and respiration is a chemical 
process.
Diﬀ erent animals have diﬀ erent breathing mechanisms 
adapted to suit their habitats.

tubes, A and B, and added a pinch 
of rice ﬂ our to the test tubes, half-
ﬁ lled with water and stirred them 
properly. To test tube B, he added 
a few drops of saliva. He left the 
two test tubes for 35–45 min. After 
that, he added iodine solution into 
both the test tubes. Experimental 
results are as shown in Fig. 9.15.
What do you think he wants to 
test?
10. Rakshita designed an experiment 
taking two clean test tubes, A 
and B and ﬁ lled them with lime 
water as shown in the ﬁ gure. In 
test tube A, the surrounding air 
that we inhale was passed on by 
sucking air from the pipe, and in 
test tube B, the exhaled air was 
blown through the pipe (Fig. 9.16). What do you think she is 
trying to investigate? How can she conﬁ rm her ﬁ ndings?
Exploratory Projects
What are the good practices for maintaining oral hygiene? Try 
to gather information on the same from books/newspapers/
conversation with elders. Prepare a report.
Find out diﬀ erent ways to maintain a healthy digestive system. 
Suggest some food items that help to maintain good digestive 
health. Make a report and present it in class.
Using coloured clay, prepare a 3-D model of the digestive system and 
label all parts of the digestive system using black paper strips. 
What is air quality and AQI? Find out the eﬀ ect of air quality on 
the respiratory systems of people working in various ﬁ elds — 
farmers, factory workers, or street vendors.
Try to read about the box-breathing 
technique (Fig. 9.17). What are its 
beneﬁ ts? 
Both birds and mammals have 
lungs for breathing, but birds can 
ﬂ y at high altitudes where oxygen 
levels are low. How might their 
respiratory system be adapted to 
help them survive in such conditions?
