These students are describing some changes. What kinds of 
changes are they talking about?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Activity 5.1: Let us think and reﬂ ect
You might have observed various changes happening around 
you. Some of them are listed in Table 5.1, you may notice that 
something is changing in each case. Take a moment to reﬂ ect on 
the changes in each case. Record your observations in Table 5.1.

You might have noticed that these changes could be in the size, 
shape, smell, or other property of the substance or object. Can you 
think of some other changes that happen in your surroundings? 
Make a list of those changes too.  
We observe the changes occurring around us with the help of 
our senses of sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste.
Can we arrange these 
changes into categories?
Let us try to answer this question.

Activity 5.2: Let us create and discuss
A. Creating some objects with paper 
Take a few sheets of paper 
and fold them to create 
new objects (Fig. 5.1).
Do you get the same paper 
back when you unfold 
these objects?
B. Playing with a balloon
Take a balloon and inﬂ ate 
it. Now, loosen your grip 
and let the air escape out.
Do you get the uninﬂ ated balloon back? 
Take another balloon; inﬂ ate it and grip the opening 
tightly. Now, prick it with a pin. 
Caution — Be careful while using a pin.
What happens? Will you be able to get the uninﬂ ated 
balloon back?
C. Crushing a piece of chalk
Crush a small piece of chalk into powder.
Can you get the chalk piece back from the powder?
Is there any similarity in the changes listed in A, B, and C?
During all these changes, materials, such as the paper, the 
rubber sheet of the balloon, and the chalk, remained the same, 
though their appearances (shape or size) may have changed. You 
may also recall from the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that 
water can exist in diﬀ erent states (solid, liquid, and gas), and can 
change from one state to another. 
In all these cases, although we observe a change in the 
appearance, no new substance is formed. Such changes in which 
only physical properties like shape, size, and state of substances 
change are called physical changes. 
Let us explore a diﬀ erent type of change.

Appearance and Not Remain 
the Same!
Activity 5.3: Let us explore 
Take two glass tumblers or small transparent bottles. Mark 
them A and B. 
Fill one-fourth of glass tumbler A with tap water and 
one-fourth of glass tumbler B with lime water. 
Now, blow air (exhale) into each glass tumbler, one at a time, 
using separate straws (Fig. 5.2) and observe them. 
Caution — Do not suck the water or lime water while doing this.

Fig. 5.2: Blowing air in (a) tap water; (b) lime water
Do you notice any changes?  
In glass tumbler A, blowing air into water creates bubbles 
only, and there is no change in the appearance of the water. In 
glass tumbler B, blowing air into lime water creates bubbles, and 
turns the lime water milky (or cloudy). If we leave it for some 
time, a white substance settles at the bottom of the glass tumbler, 
indicating something new has formed. Such changes, in which 
one or more new substances are formed, are called chemical 
changes. New substances are formed through a process called 
chemical reaction. In this case, carbon dioxide from the air you 
breathe out (exhale) reacts with lime water, and forms a new 
white-coloured substance (calcium carbonate) that is insoluble 
in water. Therefore, the liquid in the bottle appears milky. Along 
with this a small amount of water is also formed. This formation 
of a new substance indicates a chemical change. The chemical 
reaction involved in this change can be represented in short 
form as a chemical equation. 
 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical
Calcium hydroxide + Carbon dioxide 
 Calcium carbonate + Water
       (Lime water) 
(Insoluble substance)
The turning of lime water milky is also used as a test for 
carbon dioxide. Let us explore this with another activity using 
some substances from our kitchen.
Activity 5.4: Let us experiment 
Take a teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon juice in a test tube.
Add a pinch of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) 
to it.
What do you observe?
You would hear a ﬁ zzing bubbling sound and see the gas 
bubbles forming.
Pass this gas through freshly prepared lime water kept in 
another test tube, as shown in Fig. 5.3a. 
What do you observe?
The lime water turns milky. What do you infer about the gas 
formed by mixing vinegar and baking soda?
This indicates that the gas formed is carbon dioxide.
This activity can also be performed using two small used 
bottles instead of test tubes and a ﬂ exible straw, as shown in 
Fig. 5.3b.

Since a new substance, carbon dioxide, is formed in this 
reaction, we say that a chemical change has occurred here as 
well. It can be represented as—
Vinegar + Baking soda 
 Carbon dioxide + Other substances
Repeat the above activity using baking soda and water. Do you 
observe any bubble formation? Is this a physical or a chemical 
change?

5.3 Some Other Processes Involving 
Chemical Changes
g
5.3.1 Rusting
In the rusting of iron, which you studied 
in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and 
Non-metals’, a new brown-coloured 
substance called rust is formed. Thus, 
rusting is also a chemical change because 
it involves the formation of a new 
substance, iron oxide (Fig. 5.4). 
5.3.2 Combustion
Let us recall the burning of a magnesium ribbon 
(Fig. 5.5) learnt in the chapter ‘The World of 
Metals and Non-metals’. Can you predict if this is 
a physical or a chemical change?
When the magnesium ribbon is burnt, a new 
substance, magnesium oxide, is formed. So, the 
burning of magnesium ribbon also involves a 
chemical change. We observed that heat and light 
are also produced along with the formation of a 
new substance in this reaction.
The burning of magnesium ribbon can be represented as—
Magnesium + Oxygen 
 Magnesium oxide + Heat + Light
 
   (Ribbon)          (Air)         (White powder)
A chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen 
and produces heat and/or light is called combustion. Substances 
that undergo combustion reactions are called combustible
substances. For example, wood, paper, cotton, kerosene, etc., 
are combustible substances.
Fig. 5.4: Rusted 
iron nails
Fig. 5.5: Burning magnesium ribbon 
Let us ﬁ nd out whether the presence of oxygen 
is essential for combustion. 
Activity 5.5: Let us investigate 
Place two identical candles on two separate 
petri dishes and light them.
Cover one of these with a glass tumbler, as 
shown in Fig. 5.6. 
What happens to the candle ﬂ ames in the two 
cases?     
Fig. 5.6: Candle (a) burning 
(b) covered with a glass tumbler
(a)
(b)
 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical
We observe that the candle that was not covered (Fig. 5.6a) 
continues to burn, whereas the candle that was covered with a 
glass tumbler (Fig. 5.6b) stops burning after some time. Why does 
this happen?
Since the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have 
a continuous supply of air, the ﬂ ame gets extinguished soon. 
The component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This 
can be conﬁ rmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass 
tumbler inverted on the candle. How can you test the presence 
of carbon dioxide gas? 
You can test the carbon dioxide gas by adding a small amount 
of lime water in the petri dish. You will notice that it turns milky. 
This carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and 
the oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for 
combustion.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
If a person’s clothes catch ﬁ re, what is the best way to extinguish 
the ﬁ re?
Wrap a blanket or cloth around the person. This cuts oﬀ  the 
supply of air, and the ﬁ re gets extinguished. 
Caution — Synthetic blanket or cloth should never be used to put 
out a ﬁ re, as these can melt and stick to the skin.
FASCINATING FACTS
Nature’s wonders: You might have 
seen some insects emitting light in 
a garden or a ﬁ eld in late evenings. 
These insects are called ﬁ reﬂ ies, and 
their light is produced by a chemical 
change. This type of light production 
(without heat) in living organisms is 
called bioluminescence.

Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion?
We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen 
are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a 
combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any 
length of time without it catching ﬁ re. What else is needed to 
start combustion?
Let us learn about this.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Activity 5.6: Let us investigate 
Caution — Perform this activity under the supervision of your teacher 
or an adult.
Hold a piece of paper with a pair of 
tongs and bring a lighted matchstick 
to it. It quickly catches ﬁ re. Do we say 
that we need a ﬁ re to start the burning 
process? 
Take another piece of paper. Using a 
magnifying glass, focus the sunrays to 
make the smallest and brightest spot on 
the paper, as shown in the Fig. 5.7a. 
Hold it there for some time. 
What do you observe?
We observe that the paper starts to 
emit 
smoke, 
and 
then 
catches 
ﬁ re 
(Fig. 5.7b). Thus, we ﬁ nd that a substance 
can burn even without ﬁ re. How do we 
explain this change?
Focusing sunrays on the paper heats 
it. The temperature of the paper increases 
with time. After some time, the paper 
becomes so hot that it starts burning. 
This minimum temperature at which a 
substance catches ﬁ re is called its ignition 
temperature. Since the temperature of the 
lighted matchstick was already higher than 
the ignition temperature of the paper, it 
caught ﬁ re almost immediately.
Fig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a 
magnifying glass
Fig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire
So, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur, 
there are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) —
(i) A combustible substance, also called ‘fuel’
(ii) Oxygen
(iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature.
5.4 Can Physical and Chemical Changes 
Occur in the Same Process? 
What changes take place when a candle is lit? Let us explore!

Activity 5.7: Think, pair, and share
Look at the Fig. 5.9. Analyse what students are discussing about 
the burning candle. 
What do you think?
Fig. 5.9: What changes occur when a candle burns?
The wax melts and 
evaporates...

Wax melts, ﬂ ows, 
and solidiﬁ es in 
diﬀ erent shapes...
Maybe...
The wax of the candle melts, is carried up the wick, and 
evaporates due to the heat of the ﬂ ame. The vapour of wax burns 
to produce a ﬂ ame. The melting of wax, its solidiﬁ cation, and 
evaporation are physical changes. The burning of vapour on the 
other hand, is a chemical change. This shows that the burning of 
a candle involves both physical and chemical changes.
KNOW A SCIENTIST
The candle you just observed has long been an object of curiosity for 
several scientists including Michael Faraday, who made signiﬁ cant 
contributions to several areas of science. In the 
nineteenth century, Faraday delivered a series 
of lectures called Chemical History of a Candle. 
Faraday believed that the candle was the perfect 
object to introduce scientiﬁ c study. Through 
it, he discussed diﬀ erences between various 
physical and chemical processes like melting, 
vapourisation, and combustion.

5.5 Are Changes Permanent?
Once something has undergone a change, can we get it back in 
its original form?
g
Activity 5.8: Let us think
Think again about all the changes that we have discussed 
or talked about so far. In which of these can we get back the 
object or substance in the form we started with? Record your 
observations in Table 5.2.

Returning to the original object or substance with which we 
started shows that the changes we brought can be reversed. For 
example, when ice melts, it can be refrozen into ice. Similarly, 
when water evaporates, it can be condensed back into liquid 
water. However, some changes cannot be reversed since we 
cannot get the original object or substance back after the change. 
For example, chopped vegetables cannot return to their original 
size and shape, and making popcorn cannot go back to its original 
form. Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that 
can be reversed and those that cannot be reversed.
5.6 Are All Changes Desirable? 
g
Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the 
changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, 
and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you 
think of some other desirable changes happening around you?
 Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical
On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such 
as the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. 
A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable 
in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be 
very useful in converting food waste into compost.
Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity 
can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the 
increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., 
is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many 
substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution.
5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes
g
5.7.1 Weathering of rocks
Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of 
mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How 
have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that 
break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due 
to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of 
water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break.
Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with 
the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An 
example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, 
an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains 
iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The 
red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock 
surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing 
water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are 
collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the 
formation of soil.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
5.7.2 Erosion 
Have you noticed ﬁ ne sand collecting on riverbeds or in lakes? 
This sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are 
broken down and moved from one location to another by natural 
forces like wind and ﬂ owing water. This process is called erosion.
Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. 
River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the 
constant erosion caused by the ﬂ owing water. When the speed 
of the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the 
material transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. 
These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most 
of these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot 
be reversed.
In a Nutshell
A physical change is one in which a substance or object 
undergoes a change in its physical properties and no new 
substance is formed.
A chemical change is one in which one or more new 
substances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and 
can be represented by a chemical equation.
Combustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical 
changes.
Substances that undergo combustion are combustible 
substances. Heat and/or light are given out during 
combustion.
The lowest temperature at which a substance can catch ﬁ re 
is called its ignition temperature. 
Some changes can be reversed and some cannot.
Some changes are desirable and some are not.
Rocks undergo physical and chemical changes due to 
weathering to form soil.
Erosion caused by ﬂ owing water and wind is a physical 
change.

into a clay pot (physical change/chemical change). The fruits, 
vegetable peels, and other materials begin to decompose 
due to the action of bacteria and fungi, forming compost 
(physical change/chemical change). He decides to plant 
seeds in the compost and water them regularly. After a few 
days, he notices that the seeds begin to germinate and small 
plants start to grow, eventually blooming into colourful 
ﬂ owers (physical change/chemical change). His eﬀ orts are
