On 28 February, the school hosted a science fair to celebrate 
National Science Day. At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and 
Keerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were 
curious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them!
A few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid 
on these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets 
sprayed. To their surprise, the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful 
World of Science’ appeared on the papers the moment the liquid 
was sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how 
this happened and the reason behind it.
Their curiosity was partly satisﬁ ed at the ‘Colourful World 
of Substances’ stall. They saw many activities showing colour 
changes on mixing diﬀ erent substances. They decided to explore 
these changes further. Let us join them on this learning adventure.

Take a strip of blue litmus paper 
and cut it into small pieces.
Spread these pieces on a clean 
and dry white tile.
Using a dropper, put one drop of 
each of the samples, one-by-one, 
on these litmus paper pieces, as 
shown in Fig. 2.2a.
Do you observe any change 
in the colour of the blue 
litmus pieces?
Record your observations

observations in Table 2.1.
How to prepare lime water?
Do not confuse lime water with the word lime, which is a fruit 
similar to lemon.
Lime water (solution of calcium hydroxide in water) can be 
easily prepared by mixing lime (chuna, i.e. calcium oxide) in water 
and leaving it undisturbed for some time, say an hour. Filter the 
liquid into another container and use it as lime water.

Group A with samples that turn the blue litmus paper to red. 
Group B with samples that turn the red litmus paper to blue. 
Group C with samples that do not aﬀ ect either of the two 
litmus papers.

Let us ﬁ nd out!
Litmus is a natural substance obtained from lichens. It is 
available  both as a solution and in the form of paper strips, 
known as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two 
colours—blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3. 
Substances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in 
nature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic
in nature. Since litmus shows diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic 
solutions, it is called an acid-base indicator.
Some other substances, both natural and synthetic, can 
also be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in 
laboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher 
grades.
HOLISTIC LENS
Lichens are formed by the association of two 
living organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow 
on rocks and trees in regions that have abundant 
rainfall and clean air. Do you ﬁ nd lichens on trees 
in your neighbourhood?
Lichens
Now, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B, 
and Group C in Table 2.2.
The substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice, 
tamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to 
red, implying that these substances are acidic in nature. 
The substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking 
soda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution 
turned the red litmus paper to blue. Hence, these substances 
are basic in nature. 
The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, 
and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus 
paper. Can you predict their nature?
These substances are said to be neutral because they are 
neither acidic nor basic.
I am curious to know — what are these 
red and blue litmus paper strips made of? 
Why do they change colour when drops 
of some samples are put on them?
Fig. 2.3: Blue and red litmus 
paper strips
 Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral
Now, I can check 
the nature of ﬂ oor 
cleaning liquid using 
an indicator! 
Activity 2.2: Let us relate and explore
Are all the substances in Group A of Table 2.2 edible? Have you 
ever tasted these edible substances? Can you recall their taste? 
You will ﬁ nd that all these substances taste sour. Thus, we can 
say that substances that taste sour tend to contain acids and are 
acidic in nature.
Caution — Do not taste anything until asked to do so. Do not taste any 
unknown substance.
Some common edible substances and the names of the most 
common acids present in them are given in Fig. 2.4.
Tartaric acid
Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) 
and Citric acid

Fig. 2.4: The most common acids present in some edible substances
Find out and write the names of the most common acids 
present in the following substances —
Lemon________, Curd________, Tamarind________, Vinegar________.
Now, let us take one of the substances — baking soda 
solution — from Group B. Rub the baking soda solution between 
your ﬁ ngers. What do you observe? 
It feels soapy or slippery. Basic substances are generally 
slippery to touch.
Also, bases generally taste bitter, but 
everything that tastes bitter may not 
contain a base. For example, bitter gourd 
(karela) possesses a bitter taste but is not 
basic in nature.
If litmus is not available, are there 
some other natural substances 
that 
can 
serve 
as 
acid-base 
indicators?

2.1.2 Red rose as an indicator
You might have observed many coloured ﬂ owers in your 
surroundings. Try making your indicators using these ﬂ owers.
Activity 2.3: Let us prepare 
Collect some fallen petals of 
red roses available in your 
surroundings (Fig.  2.5). It is 
advised not to pluck ﬂ owers. You 
may pick petals or ﬂ owers fallen 
on the ground.
Take a ﬁ stful of the collected 
petals of red roses and wash 
them with water. 
Crush the petals using a mortar 
and pestle.
Place them in a glass tumbler.
Pour some hot water into the glass tumbler to ensure that 
the crushed ﬂ ower petals are completely immersed.
Caution — Perform this step under the supervision of an adult.
Cover the glass tumbler with a lid. Wait for 5 – 10 minutes till 
the water becomes coloured (Fig. 2.6), and ﬁ lter it.
The ﬁ ltrate (liquid after ﬁ ltration) is the required ﬂ ower 
extract (Fig. 2.7) to be used as an acid-base indicator.

Discuss your observations with your classmates.
Are the samples that change the colour of the ﬂ ower extract 
to a shade of red the same as those that changed the colour 
of blue litmus paper to red? (Group A, Table 2.2)
Are the samples that change the colour of the ﬂ ower extract 
to a shade of green the same as those that changed the colour 
of red litmus paper to blue? (Group B, Table 2.2)
Are the samples that do not change the colour of the ﬂ ower 
extract the same as those that did not change the colour of 
red and blue litmus papers? (Group C, Table 2.2)
From the above activity, we can conclude that the red rose 
extract can also be used to test the nature of the substances; 
hence, it is another example of an acid-base indicator. We can 
conclude that the red rose extract seems to give red colour in an 
acidic solution and green colour in a basic solution.
Can you now ﬁ ll in the nature of the substances in Table 2.3?
Add 
20 – 30 
drops 
of 
lemon juice in test tube A 
and 20 – 30 drops of soap 
solution in test tube B with 
the help of droppers. 
Observe and record any 
colour changes (Fig. 2.8) to 
the extract in Table 2.3. 
Repeat the same with the 
other 
samples 
used 
in 
Activity 2.1 and record your 
observations in Table 2.3.

We are sure that you will be excited about the above results. 
You may repeat the process of preparing the extract and testing 
substances with some vegetables, fruits, or ﬂ owers, such as 
beetroot, purple cabbage, turmeric, Indian blackberry (jamun), 
and red hibiscus (gudhal) ﬂ ower. They can also act as acid-base 
indicators.
FASCINATING FACTS
Hydrangea is a plant that 
grows in cooler climates in 
the Himalayan region and the 
North-eastern states. It gives 
ﬂ owers of diﬀ erent colours, 
depending on the nature of the 
soil. Acidic soil produces blue-
coloured 
ﬂ owers, 
whereas 
in basic soil, the ﬂ owers are 
pink or red. Can gardeners alter the colour of hydrangea ﬂ owers by 
adjusting the acidic or basic nature of the soil?

2.1.3 Turmeric as an indicator
We have used blue and red litmus paper strips in Activity 2.1. Can 
you also make paper strips with some other natural indicators? 
Find out by performing the following activity.
Activity 2.5: Let us prepare
Take a spoonful of turmeric (haldi) in a petri dish or container 
and add a little water to make a paste (Fig. 2.9a). You may 
also grind a piece of fresh turmeric.
Carefully dip a piece of ﬁ lter paper in the turmeric paste 
until it gets yellow colour.
Take it out and allow it to dry.
Cut this yellow paper into thin strips, which are used as 
‘turmeric paper’ (Fig. 2.9b).
Caution — Perform this step under the supervision of an adult.

be 
used as an indicator for acidic 
substances? 
Discuss 
your 
observations with your classmates.
Based on the observations, we can conclude that turmeric 
paper can be used to test basic substances. However, it cannot 
diﬀ erentiate between acidic and neutral substances.
FASCINATING FACTS
Why is turmeric known as a ‘Golden’ spice?
Turmeric is a member of the ginger family, 
which is grown in India and other countries. 
A common spice in daily households, it is being 
researched for beneﬁ ts beyond the taste and 
colour it provides to the food! In the Ayurvedic 
system of medicine, turmeric is considered to have numerous health 
beneﬁ ts, and is commonly used in several traditional home remedies.

Ashwin created a greeting card to pay gratitude to his teacher 
on the day of Guru Purnima. He applied turmeric paste on white 
paper and dried it. He wrote 
his wishes in the teacher's 
mother 
tongue 
(Odia 
language) on the dried paper 
using one of the solutions 
tested in Table  2.4. Which 
solution can be used to write 
the message? His teacher 
applauded his creative use 
of this concept.
Are there any substances 
whose odours change on 
adding acidic or basic 
substances?
I respect my teacher as she nurtured 
curiosity within me and bestowed 
upon me the gift of learning. I bow 
my head in gratitude to her!
There are some substances whose odours change in an acidic 
or basic medium. These are called olfactory indicators. 
Let us explore more!
Activity 2.6: Let us investigate
Take some ﬁ nely chopped onions in a container, along with 
some strips of clean cotton cloth or ﬁ lter paper.
Tightly close the container and leave it overnight.
Take two of the cotton cloth or ﬁ lter paper strips from the 
container and check their odour.
Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of 
tamarind water on one strip and a few drops of baking soda 
solution on the other. Allow the drops to spread on the strips.
Check the odour again.
Do you notice any change in the odour of the onion strips 
before and after putting tamarind water and baking soda 
solution on them?
Note your observations. 
Similarly, test the change in the odour with other acidic and 
basic substances and record your observations.

2.2  What Happens When Acidic Substances 
Mix with Basic Substances?
Let us investigate by performing the following experiment.
Activity 2.7: Let us experiment
Take one drop of lemon juice in a test tube and 
add around twenty drops of water to it. Observe 
the colour.
Add a drop of blue litmus solution to it.
Do you observe any colour change (Fig. 2.10a)?
Slowly add drops of lime water to this test tube with 
the help of a dropper and swirl it well. 
What do you observe? Is there any change in the 
colour of the solution?
A stage comes when the colour of the solution 
changes from red to blue (Fig. 2.10b).
Again, add one drop of lemon juice to the above 
solution.
Can you predict why there is a change in colour?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Initially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the 
lemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When 
lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution 
eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution 
in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised 
the eﬀ ect of the acid.
When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a 
base in suﬃ  cient quantity, we ﬁ nd that the resulting solution is 
neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation
reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed 
with the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. 
Acid + Base →Salt + Water + Heat
There are many examples in everyday life where you can 
observe the use of neutralisation processes.
Let us ﬁ nd out!
  2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life
y
Situation 1: Keerthi was observing a butterﬂ y in 
the garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk. 
Suddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red 
with stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped 
her by applying moist baking soda to the aﬀ ected 
area, which relieved the pain. What do you think 
might be the reason for this? 
When an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid 
(formic acid) into the skin. The eﬀ ect of the acid 
can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda, 
which is a base.
What remedies do people use to treat ant bites 
in your region? 
Situation 2: On the Farmer’s Portal (an 
online platform from the Department of 
Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers 
Welfare), a query from a farmer states, “My 
plants are not growing well lately”. After 
a detailed discussion, it was found that 
the excessive use of chemical fertilisers 
(substances added to soil to help plants 
grow better) made the soil acidic. What 
remedy might be provided to him? 
When the soil is too acidic, the plants 
do not grow well. It can be treated with 
lime, which is a base. (Fig. 2.12).
Fig. 2.11: Stinging eﬀ ect 
of an ant bite
Fig. 2.12: Neutralising the acidic 
nature of soil
 Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral
If the soil is basic, organic matter like manure and composted 
leaves are added to it. Organic matter releases acids that 
neutralise the basic nature of the soil.
Sometimes, the soil may be neutral, but the plants growing in 
it may still show poor health, which can be due to the deﬁ ciency 
of nutrients in the soil.
Situation 3: Ashwin’s friend Gurbir stays near an industrial area. 
He shared with him that the ﬁ sh population in his neighbourhood 
lake was declining day by day! What do you think might be the 
causes for this? It may be due to factory waste being released 
into the lake. 
If the factory waste is acidic in nature, what could be done to 
save the ﬁ sh in the lake? 
The factory waste can be neutralised by adding basic 
substances before releasing into the lake.
Let us wrap up!
Now, can you explain why the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful 
World of Science’ appeared on Ashwin and Keerthi’s paper sheets 
when the liquid was sprayed on them? 
Do you think that one possibility could be using a turmeric 
solution for the spraying liquid and a soap solution for writing 
on the paper?
In a Nutshell
Substances around us may be classiﬁ ed as acidic, basic, and 
neutral in nature. 
Extracts of lichen, red rose, red hibiscus, purple cabbage, 
turmeric, etc., can be used to indicate the nature of substances.
Substances that show diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic 
solutions are called acid-base indicators.  
Acids turn the colour of blue litmus to red. Bases turn the 
colour of red litmus to blue. 
Extract of red rose gives red colour in acidic solutions and 
green colour in basic solutions. 
The yellow colour of turmeric turns red in basic solutions 
but remains unchanged in acidic and neutral solutions.
An acid and a base neutralise each other, forming salt and 
water, along with the evolution of heat.
Many day-to-day problems like a red ant bite, acidic or basic 
nature of soil, and industrial waste can be attempted to be 
managed by the process of neutralisation.
