Life Processes 
in Plants
In Grade 6, we learnt that all living beings grow and need food 
for their growth. Also, in the previous chapter, we discussed the 
process through which animals obtain nutrition.  
We know that animals eat food to grow, but what about 
plants? Have you ever seen plants eating food like animals do? 
As animals grow, their size and weight usually increase, and their 
bodies undergo various changes. What changes do you notice in 
plants when they grow?
We learnt that food provides nutrients like carbohydrates, 
fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which, along with water, 
are all essential for growth. Let us explore how plants obtain 
nutrients for their growth.

10.1 How Do Plants Grow?
Look around your neighbourhood. Have you observed any 
changes in a plant during its life span? As a plant grows, new 
leaves and branches emerge, its height increases, and its stem 
thickens. What do you think causes these changes? Discuss with 
your friends and provide your explanation as well. 
When we water plants 
regularly, they grow better. 
So, I think water also 
contributes to its growth.
I think sunlight plays 
some role in the growth 
of  plants.
Maybe plants take 
up food from the soil 
through their roots. 
I think, maybe, ________ 
plays some role!
Let us perform an experiment to test some of these explanations. 
Activity 10.1: Let us test some explanations 
Take three earthen pots (or used bottles/containers) of the 
same size ﬁ lled with garden soil. Plant saplings of similar sizes 
of a fast-growing plant like chilli or 
tomato in each pot (Fig. 10.1).
Label the pots A, B, and C.
Count the number of leaves on 
each sapling and record your 
observations.
Place pot A in direct sunlight. Keep 
the soil in this pot slightly moist 
by adding an adequate amount of 
water every day (Fig. 10.1a).
Place pot B in direct sunlight, 
without adding water to the soil 
(Fig. 10.1b).

Place pot C in the dark. Keep the soil in this pot slightly moist 
by adding an adequate amount of water every day (Fig. 10.1c).
Observe the plants for two weeks1 and record changes in 
their height, number of leaves, colour of leaves, and any 
other changes that may appear.
Record your observations in Table 10.1.

Which pot has the plant with the maximum growth?
Which pot has the plant with the least growth?
Analyse the observations recorded in Table 10.1, and discuss 
them with your teacher and friends.
You are likely to ﬁ nd that the plant in Pot A, kept in direct 
sunlight with adequate water, grows better than the plant in Pot 
C, which gets adequate water but no sunlight. The plant in Pot 
B may have died as it did not get water even though it received 
adequate sunlight.
What do you infer from the observations made in this activity? 
The results indicate that plants require both sunlight and water 
for their growth. 
1   This experiment will need two weeks. Teachers can plan this activity 
accordingly.

“Trees do not produce fruits and flowers merely because they are planted.”
This line is from an ancient Indian text named Vrikshayurveda. It records 
useful observations about plant growth, soil, and agricultural practices to 
help improve crop health, growth and production. The knowledge in the 
text seems to be based on practical experiences and patterns seen over 
time. These ideas were then systematically documented to guide farming 
practices. For instance, there are references to diﬀ erent methods of organic 
manure preparation, such as mixing water, barley, and various seeds, like 
green, black, and horse grams.

10.2  How Do Plants Get Food for their 
Growth?
We know that animals get their food from plants, either directly by 
eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that in turn eat plants 
for their nutrition and growth. But how do plants obtain the food 
they need to grow? Unlike animals, plants do not eat food. 
10.2.1 Leaves: the ̒ food factories̓ of plants
Plants store food in the form of starch, a type of carbohydrate. 
This starch is produced in the leaves of a plant which, by design, 
are generally broad and ﬂ at. These are mostly green because of 
the presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll, that helps in 
capturing sunlight eﬃ  ciently.
Let us ﬁ nd out the role chlorophyll plays in the preparation of 
food in the form of starch in plants.

Activity 10.2: Let us check (demonstration activity)
The teacher may demonstrate this 
activity.
Keep a leaf in boiling water  for 
ﬁ ve minutes to soften it.
Dip this leaf in a test tube 
containing alcohol.
Place the test tube in a beaker 
containing 
boiling 
water. 
Wait until the leaf becomes 
colourless (Fig. 10.2a).

Take out the leaf and place it on a plate. 
Now, put a few drops of diluted iodine solution with the help 
of a dropper on the decolourised leaf (Fig. 10.2b). Wait for a 
few minutes and observe.
If the colour of the leaf changes to blue-black, it indicates the 
presence of starch.
Caution — Alcohol should never be placed near a heat source directly, 
as it is highly ﬂ ammable and can easily lead to ﬁ re and burns. 
Did you wonder why we decolourise the leaf in the 
beginning of this activity?
Decolourisation of a leaf enables us to easily observe 
colour change and, thus, the presence of starch.

In Activity 10.1, we have learnt that water and sunlight are 
essential for plant growth. In Activity 10.2, we have discovered 
that green leaves store starch as food. 
Bhaskar loves gardening during his free time. Being a curious 
student, he often looks around his garden and wonders how 
plants produce food. From his experiences, Bhaskar knows 
that water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. But he 
wonders if sunlight contributes to the production of food in the 
form of starch in plants.
How does sunlight 
contribute in the production 
of starch in plants? 
Activity 10.3: Let us check 
Bhaskar took a leaf having both green and non-green patches 
from each of two similar potted plants — one kept in sunlight and 
the other kept in the dark for 36 hours. He wanted to compare 
the leaves before and after the starch test. 
He made a sketch of the leaves to record the location of the 
green and the non-green patches on them with the help of a 
tracing paper. After that, he performed an iodine test (as shown 
in Activity 10.2) on the leaves. Bhaskar recorded his observations 
in Table 10.2.

In Table 10.2, Bhaskar recorded a blue-black colour (indicating 
the presence of starch) on the green patches of the leaf obtained 
from the plant placed in sunlight. Bhaskar also recorded that the 
leaf obtained from the plant kept in the dark does not show a 
blue-black colour, even on the green patches, indicating that no 
starch has been produced. Non-green patches of the leaf obtained 
from the plant placed in sunlight do not turn blue-black. Does it 
indicate that there is no chlorophyll present in those patches? 
The non-green patches may not have suﬃ  cient chlorophyll to 
prepare enough starch to be detected using the iodine test. 
FASCINATING FACTS
Some plant leaves appear red, violet, 
or brown because they contain more 
of these coloured pigments than the 
green-coloured chlorophyll. This hides 
the green colour. Some of these pigments 
also help in photosynthesis. You can use 
an iodine test to check for the presence 
of starch in these leaves, indicating that 
photosynthesis has indeed taken place. 
 
 
t 
Life Processes in Plants
What do we infer from the observations listed in Table 10.2? 
As we know, leaves are mostly green because of the presence 
of chlorophyll. We have also seen that the starch is produced 
where green patches of the leaf are present. We can infer that 
chlorophyll helps in preparing starch in the presence of sunlight. 
In fact, it is essential for the preparation of starch. Hence, the 
leaves are also called ‘food factories’ of plants. 
What else is essential for the preparation of food in plants? 
Let us ﬁ nd out. 
10.2.2 Role of air in the preparation of food
Activity 10.4: Let us experiment 
(demonstration activity)
The teacher may demonstrate this activity.
Take a potted green plant and keep it in the 
dark for two to three days to allow it to destarch 
(i.e., lose any stored starch). Then, locate one 
leaf of this plant for this experiment.
Take a wide-mouthed bottle and pour some 
caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) into it 
(caustic soda absorbs carbon dioxide from 
the air). 
Caution — Caustic soda is a strong chemical that can 
cause skin burns; only teachers should handle it.
Insert half of the destarched leaf into the 
bottle through a split cork, leaving the other 
half of the leaf outside, and place the bottle as 
shown in Fig. 10.3a.

(Yes/No)
We notice that the part of the leaf that was outside the bottle 
turns blue-black, indicating the presence of starch. However, the 
part of the leaf inside the bottle does not turn blue-black in colour, 
indicating that food is not made in that part of the leaf. This is 
because the caustic soda solution inside the ﬂ ask absorbs the 
carbon dioxide present in the air. What does this experiment show?
This experiment shows that carbon dioxide present in the air 
is essential for plants to prepare starch. 
Based on Activities 10.3 and 10.4, what do you conclude? 
Which part of the plant is involved in the synthesis of starch?  
Based on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight, 
water, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the 
synthesis of food in plants. This process by which plants prepare 
food in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called 
photosynthesis. A leaf is the primary site for photosynthesis.  Do 
other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, 
other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform 
photosynthesis.
So far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from 
the air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the 
process of photosynthesis. But have you ever thought about what 
more happens during this process? Do plants only take in 
Life Processes in Plants
substances from their surroundings, or do they also release 
something? Let us explore this through an experiment performed 
by Barkha didi. 
Activity 10.5: Let us explore
Look at Fig. 10.4. Compare the 
two set-ups labelled as A and B, 
and analyse. 
In Fig. 10.4, set-up A is placed in 
sunlight, and set-up B is placed in 
the dark. What diﬀ erence do you 
observe in the two set-ups? Do 
you observe air bubbles emerging 
in the inverted test tube in set-up 
A? The gas produced in this set-up 
caused bubbles to emerge and get 
accumulated in the inverted test 
tube. Which gas is this?

She inferred that the gas in the test tube is rich in 
oxygen. It indicates that oxygen is released during 
the process of photosynthesis. It also indicates that 
photosynthesis occurs in the presence of sunlight.
When suﬃ  cient gas was accumulated in the 
inverted test tube, Barkha didi placed her 
thumb on the mouth of the test tube while 
taking the test tube oﬀ  the set-up. She then 
quickly inserted a lit matchstick into the tube 
and the matchstick produced an intense ﬂ ame. 
Oh yes! I remember. In our science lab,  I 
have seen a similar set-up placed under 
sunlight near a window. 
Based on Barkha didi’s experiment, we can conclude that 
oxygen is released during photosynthesis.

10.2.3 Photosynthesis: in a 
nutshell
We know that water, sunlight, carbon 
dioxide from the air, and chlorophyll 
are necessary to carry out the process 
of 
photosynthesis 
that 
produces 
carbohydrates 
(Fig. 
10.5). 
During 
photosynthesis, 
food 
is 
actually 
produced in the form of glucose, a 
simple carbohydrate. This glucose not 
only serves as an instant source of 
energy but also later gets converted into 
starch for storage. The word equation 
of photosynthesis is given below —
 
 
 
 
          Sunlight 
Carbon dioxide + Water 
  Glucose + Oxygen
 
 
 
 
       Chlorophyll
KNOW A SCIENTIST
Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an 
understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur 
(1896–1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. 
He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the 
Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, 
Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from 
1921–1935. He studied eﬀ ects of the amount of water 
and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the 
importance of water, temperature, and the colour of 
light in the process of photosynthesis. 
10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during 
photosynthesis?
We now know that photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, and 
oxygen is released in the process. Which part of the plant helps in 
the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen? Let us conduct an 
activity to understand where the exchange of gases takes place.

(demonstration activity)
The teacher may demonstrate this activity.
Collect a leaf from a plant such as rhoeo, 
money plant, onion, hibiscus, coleus, or 
any grass.
Put it in a beaker ﬁ lled with water.
Carefully peel a thin layer from the lower 
surface of the leaf.
Place the peel in a watch glass with water.
Now, take a microscope slide and 
carefully put a drop of water on it.
Using forceps, transfer the peel of the leaf 
from the watch glass to the slide with the 
help of forceps.
Put a drop of ink on the leaf peel with the 
help of a dropper. 
Cover the peel with a coverslip and 
observe it under a microscope.
What do you observe? Do you notice tiny 
pores on the peel, as shown in Fig. 10.6? 
These pores are called stomata. Stomata, present on the surface 
of leaves, help in the exchange of gases.
10.3 Transport in Plants 
p
10.3.1 Transport of water and minerals
All living beings need water to grow. Plants use water in the 
process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in 
the soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important 
nutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals 
taken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant? 
We can study water transport in plants by carrying out an 
activity. For this activity, we require two glass tumblers, some 
water, red ink, and twigs of two similar tender plants, preferably 
with white-coloured ﬂ owers (for example, white sadabahar, 
balsam), as shown in Fig. 10.7.

Activity 10.7: Let us experiment
Take two tumblers and label them A and B. 
Fill one-third of each tumbler with water.
Add a few drops of red ink to tumbler B.
Obliquely cut the stems of both plants at their 
base while keeping them inside the water and 
immediately place one plant in each tumbler, 
as shown in Fig. 10.7a and Fig. 10.7b.
Observe these plants the next day.
What do you notice? Compare the plant 
stems placed in the tumblers. Do you observe 
red colour in the stem, leaves, and ﬂ owers of the 
plant from Tumbler B? Fig. 10.7c and Fig. 10.7d 
show the plants after one day. Compare the plant 
in Fig. 10.7c with that in Fig. 10.7d. A red colour 
is visible in the stem, leaves, and ﬂ owers of the 
plant in Fig. 10.7d. How did diﬀ erent parts of the 
plant acquire this red colour? 
Cut the stem from the upper part of the plant 
that is not immersed in the red-coloured water. 
Observe the cut stem using a magnifying glass.  Do 
you spot the red colour in the stem (Fig. 10.7e)? 
How does the red colour ink move upwards? This 
is due to the thin tube-like structure called the 
xylem present in the stem, branches, and leaves 
of plants. Just like red ink, minerals dissolved in 
water also move up the stem through the xylem. 
Now, we know that water and minerals are 
transported to the leaves and other parts of 
plants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water 
transported through the xylem is used to perform 
various functions. How does food get transported 
to other parts of a plant? 
10.3.2 Transport of food
We know that leaves are the primary site for 
photosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the 
leaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This 
food is transported through another set of thin 
tube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8). 
The transported food may also be stored in some 
other parts of a plant, such as seeds and roots.

10.4 Do Plants Respire? 
p
In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living 
Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, you learnt that all 
living beings respire. Do plants also respire like we do?
Activity 10.8: Let us ﬁ nd out
(demonstration activity)
Soak some moong bean seeds in water overnight.
Put a layer of cotton in a conical ﬂ ask (Fig. 10.9) and moisten 
the cotton with water to keep it wet. 
Place the soaked seeds over the wet cotton in the conical ﬂ ask. 
Cover the mouth of the conical ﬂ ask with 
a cork having two holes. 
Fit two tubes A and B through the two 
holes on the cork, as shown in Fig. 10.9. 
Leave it undisturbed for 24 hours in 
the dark.
Take two test tubes and ﬁ ll them with 
lime water.
Cover the mouth of one test tube with a 
cork having one hole in it.
Dip one glass tube in the test tube 
through a hole in the cork.
Connect the ﬂ ask and test tube with a rubber pipe as shown 
in Fig. 10.9.
Compare both the test tubes for any change in colour. Does 
the lime water turn milky in both the test tubes? Why does the 
lime water turn milky in the test tube connected to the ﬂ ask? 
Lime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon 
dioxide in the ﬂ ask. But where does this carbon dioxide come 
from? As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very 
small quantities in the air. In the ﬂ ask, additional carbon dioxide 
is produced by the seeds as they respire. 
During respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of 
oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The word 
equation for the proccess of respiration, is as follows — 
Glucose + Oxygen  
  Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy
The energy produced during respiration is used by plants 
for their growth and development. All parts of a plant, green or 
non-green, carry out respiration.
Thus, plants have diﬀ erent mechanisms for synthesising, 
transporting, and utilising food to get energy.

In a Nutshell
All living organisms require food that provide energy for 
their growth and development.
Plants use carbon dioxide and water in the presence of 
sunlight and chlorophyll to produce glucose and oxygen. 
This process of synthesis of food is known as photosynthesis.
Leaves are the ̒ food factories ̓ of a plant. 
Tiny pores on the surface of leaves, called stomata, help 
in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during 
photosynthesis and respiration.
The xylem transports water and minerals from roots, while 
the phloem carries food from leaves to all parts of the plants.
Plants break down glucose and release energy by a process 
called respiration. They use oxygen and release carbon 
dioxide in this process.

Kamala Sohonie (1911–1998) was a woman scientist of India. She 
received a Ph.D. degree for her remarkable contribution in the area of 
respiration in plants from Cambridge University. 
She returned to India and worked at the Lady 
Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi, and later 
at the Nutrition Research Laboratory, Coonoor. 
Thereafter, she moved to the then Royal Institute 
of Science, Bombay, where she was eventually 
appointed as Director. Much of her work helped 
improve the nutritive values of plant foods. She 
also worked on the sap of the coconut palm as a 
nutritive drink called Neera.
