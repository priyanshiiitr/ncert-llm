One morning in Kanniyakumari, Tamil Nadu, 12-year-old 
Rashmika was eagerly cycling to school. She was excited. That was 
the day her science teacher had dedicated a class for students to 
share and try to explain interesting observations.
Rashmika had been noticing that the coconut tree shadows 
were long in the morning but shorter in the afternoon on her 
way back. She thought about it and decided that the size of the 
shadows changed because the Sun moved across the sky during 
the day. But she also remembered learning that the Earth moved 
around the Sun (in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity) so she was puzzled. She wondered — does the 
Sun move in the sky? Or does the Earth move?

12.1 Rotation of the Earth
You might have also noticed that the Sun rises in the East and sets in 
the West. Have you ever wondered why? Let us try to understand 
why. Have you ever enjoyed riding a merry-go-round at a park or 
at your school? Let us go back to riding a merry-go-round!
Activity 12.1: Let us explore
Sit on a merry-go-round facing towards the outer side as 
shown in Fig. 12.1.
Fig. 12.1: A girl observing objects around 
her while riding a merry-go-round
Ask someone to turn the merry-go-
round slowly in the anti-clockwise 
direction as shown in Fig. 12.1. While 
you are sitting on the moving merry-
go-round, look around you. Do the 
objects around you appear to be 
moving? In which direction do they 
appear to be moving? 
While you turn in the anti-clockwise 
direction, the objects appear to turn 
around you in the opposite direction, that 
is, in the clockwise direction.
Now ﬁ x your gaze at a particular tree 
(or a building) ahead of you while 
sitting on the merry- go-round turning 
around in anti-clockwise direction.
In which direction do you ﬁ nd the tree turning around you? Is 
it in your view all the time?
The tree appears to turn around you in the opposite direction, 
that is, the clockwise direction. The tree appears in your view 
from your left-hand side and then moves out of your view on the 
right-hand side when you view it from a merry-go-round turning 
around in anti-clockwise direction.
Using the observations made by us while riding a merry-go-
round, let us now think. When we view from the Earth, the Sun 
appears in the East, moves across the sky from the East to the West 
and disappears in the West. Does it indicate that the Sun is moving 
in the sky? Or might it be that the Earth itself is turning around 
and the Sun just appears to move?
The fact is that the Sun appears to be moving because we view 
it from the Earth, which is turning around itself. 
Earth, Moon, and the Sun
In which way is the Earth turning around itself? To visualise 
this, let us recall some of the objects which turn around themselves. 
Have you watched a top spinning around its spindle (Fig. 12.2a)? 
Or a spinning fan (Fig. 12.2b)? Or tried spinning a ball (Fig. 12.2c)?

In a similar manner, the Earth also spins (or 
rotates) on its own axis in space as shown in Fig. 12.3. 
The Earth’s axis of rotation passes through its 
geographic North Pole and the South Pole. The Earth 
completes one rotation in about 24 hours.
When viewed from the top of the North Pole 
(Fig. 12.3), the Earth is rotating in the anti-clockwise 
direction, that is, from West to East.
Let us try to understand this with the help of a 
globe. You have used a globe in Grade 6 to represent 
the Earth and identiﬁ ed North Pole, South Pole, and 
Equator on it. You also learnt that its axis passed 
through its North and South poles (in the Grade 6 Social 
Science textbook Exploring Society India and Beyond).
Activity 12.2: Let us explore
Use a globe to represent the Earth and place a small 
sticker to mark your location on it (Fig. 12.4a). 
While viewing from above the North Pole, slowly 
rotate the globe on its axis in anti-clockwise 
direction. 
Observe how your location turns around 
and ﬁ nally comes back to its original position 
completing one rotation.
Rotation is the motion of an object 
in which all its parts move in circles 
around an imaginary line that passes 
through it. This line is called the axis 
of rotation.

Use a torch to represent the Sun. Go 
to a relatively dark room to carry 
out the further steps of the activity.
Now, shine light from the torch 
placed 
at 
some 
distance, 
say 
1.5 metres, on the globe as shown in 
Fig. 12.4b. Do you notice how half 
of the globe receives the light from 
the torch, while the other half stays 
dark? 
It is day time in that half of the globe 
which receives light, and night time in 
the other half.
In India, sunrise ﬁ rst occurs in 
the eastern part and then in other 
parts. While looking at the eastern part of India on the globe, 
rotate the globe in one direction and then in the opposite 
direction. What is the direction of rotation when light falls on 
the eastern part of India ﬁ rst? 
The light falls on the eastern part of India ﬁ rst when the globe 
rotates from West to East with respect to the North-South axis of 
the globe. 
Now while rotating the globe from West to East, observe your 
location on the Earth. Does it go through a cycle of day and 
night?
Sunrise occurs as your location moves into light and sunset 
occurs as it moves into darkness.
The Earth’s rotation from West to East causes the day-night 
cycle. As shown in Fig. 12.5, the side facing the Sun experiences 
daytime, while the other side is dark and experiences night.

to its rotation.

Now imagine that you are standing on the Equator on the 
Earth and watching the sky during one rotation of the Earth while 
it rotates from West to East. What will you observe? Will your 
observation be the same as that of the girl shown in Fig. 12.6?

Due to the rotation of the Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the

and the stars become visible in the sky.
FASCINATING FACTS
In an earlier chapter ‘Measurement of Time and 
Motion’, you learnt how the scientist Galileo 
discovered an important property of a pendulum, 
and in the seventeenth century, another scientist, 
Huygens, used that property to make pendulum 
clocks that measured time. In the middle of 
nineteenth 
century, 
another 
scientist, 
Leon 
Foucault, used a long pendulum to give the ﬁ rst 
simple demonstration of the Earth’s rotation. The 
pendulum, known as a Foucault pendulum in his 
honour, consists of a long string with a heavy bob, 
suspended from a high ceiling.
A Foucault pendulum with a length of 22 metres 
has been hung from a skylight in the Constitution 
Hall of the new Parliament building in New Delhi, 
India. It symbolises the integration of the idea of 
India with the vastness of the cosmos.

Yes, indeed! Let us look at the 
stars in the night sky to see the 
eﬀ ect of Earth’s rotation.
Activity 12.3: Let us explore
On an early evening between March and May, identify the 
Big Dipper (Saptarishi), and the Pole Star (Dhruva Tara), if 
visible, as you did in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 
Science textbook Curiosity.
Note down your location and date 
of your night sky observations. 
The activity must be carried out 
on the same night.
Draw the orientation of the Big 
Dipper in the sky with respect 
to the Pole Star (or a ﬁ xed 
tree/building on the ground 
in a direction towards the Big 
Dipper if you cannot see the 
Pole Star). Mark the time of your 
observation along with your 
sketch as shown in Fig. 12.7. 
After two hours, observe the Big Dipper again. Has it moved? 
Again, draw its orientation and note down the time.
Repeat the above step after two hours. Do you observe that 
the Big Dipper appears to move around the Pole Star (notice 
just the movement even if you cannot see the Pole Star)? 
The Earth’s axis of rotation points very close to the Pole Star in 
the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Pole Star appears nearly 
stationary in the sky from the Earth. All the stars appear to move 
around it. Just like the Sun, the Moon also appears to rise in the 
eastward direction and set in the westward direction because the 
Earth rotates from West to East.
FASCINATING FACTS

FASCINATING FACTS
Ancient Indian astronomers, including Aryabhata, had also 
noticed the daily apparent motion of the celestial objects, such 
as the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. Aryabhata was a famous 
mathematician and astronomer of ancient India who wrote an 
important treatise, Aryabhatiya, around the ﬁ fth century CE. The 
apparent motion of the stars due to the rotation of the Earth is 
explained in Verse 9, Golapada, Aryabhatiya.

Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees stationary objects as 
moving backwards, so also the stars that are stationary are seen 
by people of Lanka as moving towards the west.
Aryabhata’s stated value for the time taken by the Earth to 
complete one full rotation about its axis is around 23 hours 56 
minutes 4.1 seconds (in modern units). This value is impressively 
close to the currently accepted value.
I have seen that the stars and 
constellations that appear in the 
East at sunset change during 
diﬀ erent months.
Yes. Maybe that is why we were told to 
look for certain stars and constellations at 
certain times of the year in Grade 6. But, 
why do diﬀ erent stars appear in the night 
sky over the course of a year?
12.2 Revolution of the Earth
While rotating on its own axis, the Earth also revolves around the Sun 
as we learnt in Grade 6. This movement is diﬀ erent from rotation. 
Revolution is the motion of an object around another object. 
Curiosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7
The path an object takes while revolving around another object 
is called its orbit. If viewed from the top (Fig. 12.8), the orbit of the 
Earth around the Sun is nearly circular. (In the ﬁ gure of the Solar 
System given in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science 
textbook Curiosity, the orbit appeared elongated because it was 
a side view of the orbit). The Earth completes one revolution
around the Sun in about 365 days and 6 hours.
12.2.1 Changing view of night sky from the Earth
Every evening the Sun sets in the westward direction and the night 
sky becomes visible. We know that this occurs due to the Earth’s 
rotation. As the Earth also revolves around the Sun continuously, 
the stars seen in the night sky after sunset gradually change over 
a year as we look in diﬀ erent directions, as shown in Fig. 12.8.

12.2.2 Seasons on the Earth
I have noticed that we go 
through a cycle of seasons 
every year. Is it related to 
the revolution of the Earth 
around the Sun in some 
way?
I have also noticed 
that days are longer 
in summer than in 
winter.
The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the 
orbit, but is tilted. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits around 
the Sun (Fig. 12.9). The tilt of the Earth’s axis and the spherical 
shape of the Earth gives rise to seasons. Let us ﬁ nd out, how.

In June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun while 
the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun (Fig. 12.9). 
As seen in Fig. 12.10a, a given amount of sunrays are spread in 
a smaller area in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the 
Southern Hemisphere due to the spherical shape of the Earth’s 
surface. So that area is heated more.
Further, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight for more 
than 12 hours in June (Fig. 12.11a). So, the Northern Hemisphere 
experiences more intense sunlight, which lasts for a longer time, 
causing the summer season. In December, the situation is opposite 
in the Northern Hemisphere and it experiences winter season 
with sunlight for shorter time (Fig. 12.10b and Fig. 12.11b).

The seasons and length of daytime are reversed in the

There, it is winter in June and summer in December (Fig. 12.10 
and Fig. 12.11). 
Two incorrect reasons often given to explain why seasons occur 
on the Earth are:
When the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, it is 
closer to the Sun.
The orbit of the Earth is an oval with the Sun slightly displaced 
from its centre so the Earth is at diﬀ erent distances from the 
Sun over the year.
However, the diﬀ erence in distances in either of these cases is 
very small and these are not the reasons why seasons occur on 
the Earth. In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the longest day occurs around

solstice, the duration of a day becomes shorter while that of a 
night becomes longer. The shortest day and longest night in this 
Hemisphere occur around 22 December known as the winter

At the North Pole, the Sun rises in the East direction on the equinox 
day — 21 March, and remains continuously in the sky for six months. 
The Sun sets on 22 September. The South Pole experiences the opposite 
behaviour. The polar regions thus experience continuous sunshine for 
six months followed by a six-month period of darkness.

On the equator, there is always 12 hours of sunlight and 12 
hours of darkness. There is little diﬀ erence in the intensity of the 
sunrays falling on the equator in diﬀ erent months. Thus, for the 
southern states of India that lie close to the equator, the eﬀ ect 
of seasons is not very prominent. Other eﬀ ects, such as local 
geographical features and proximity to oceans or seas, can also 
inﬂ uence these broader patterns seen in the two hemispheres, as 
you have learnt in social science. 
12.3 Eclipses
p
Day and night cycle, seasons, the life 
on the Earth... so much is dependent 
upon the Sun. Could the light from the 
Sun get blocked by the two planets
which are revolving between the 
Earth and the Sun?
The planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to 
the Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching 
us. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can 
do that. Do you remember studying in Grade 6 that the Moon is a 
natural satellite of the Earth and it revolves around the Earth as 
the Earth revolves around the Sun? 
Curiosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7
12.3.1 Solar eclipse
At certain times, the Moon can come in between the Sun and the 
Earth in a way that obstructs the light from the Sun from reaching 
us. This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the 
Moon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from 
the Sun that we see in the sky. 
Activity 12.4: Let us explore
Ask your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about 
5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun.
Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your 
outstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. 
Are you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your 
thumb?
You can cover the entire head of your friend 
with the help of your thumb, even though your 
thumb is much smaller than the actual size of 
your friend’s head. How could it be? The size of 
any object as seen by your eye — also known as 
apparent size — depends upon both its actual 
physical size and its distance from you. The 
thumb being much closer to you as compared to 
your friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and 
your friend’s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 
are similar.
The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are 
similar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though 
the Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon 
is much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon 
can appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth.
Though the planets Mercury and Venus are much larger than 
the Moon in size, they are also much farther from the Earth as 
compared to the Moon. Thus, their apparent sizes are very much 
smaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example, 
when Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as 
a tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This 
event, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.

In areas where the Moon partially blocks out only some 
regions of the Sun, the observers see a partial solar eclipse 
(Fig. 12.13 and Fig. 12.14b). 
During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark 
during the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the 
Earth’s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the 
Moon’s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the 
total solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes. As the Moon 
begins to move away from the front of the Sun (Fig. 12.14c), we 
see a partial solar eclipse and daylight begins to return.
Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse
Caution— During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the 
Sun, thinking that it wouldn’t be strong enough to cause harm to our 
eyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to 
damage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar 
eclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses, 
binoculars, or telescopes.
Usually, 
astronomy 
organisations, such as planetaria 
and astronomy clubs hold eclipse 
viewing events during a solar 
eclipse (Fig. 12.15). 
Participating in such events 
is the best way to observe a solar 
eclipse since the organisers not 
only provide specialised eye 
protection for solar viewing, but 
also oﬀ er scientiﬁ c explanations.

Sun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle 
throughout a solar eclipse can be diﬃ  cult. To solve this, make 
a movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small 
hole, half-ﬁ ll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small 
mirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it. Place the ball on 
a circular ring, like an adhesive tape ring, so it can be turned 
around easily. Adjust it until the Sun’s image appears on a 
wall or screen. Fig.  12.15 shows this set-up where the mirror 
is ﬁ xed to a green ball.

People have observed eclipses and maintained records since 
ancient times. When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they 
feared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something 
blocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, 
even for a brief period of time, would have been extremely 
concerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in 
various parts of the world related to the activities that could not 
be carried out during eclipses—such as eating, cooking, or going 
out of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse 
occurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at 
the Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe 
the eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses 
provide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be 
observed otherwise.
FASCINATING FACTS
An eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages. 
Many ancient Indian astronomical texts provide calculations to 
predict eclipses. The best known and most referred text is the Surya
Siddhanta, which is written in the classical Sanskrit poetry tradition 
in rhythmic shlokas.
12.3.2 Lunar eclipse
As the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can 
block the sunlight from reaching the Moon. This is known as a 
lunar eclipse. On such days, we see the Earth’s shadow falling on 
the full disc of the Moon. Fig. 12.16 shows the arrangement of the 
Sun, the Earth, and the Moon during a lunar eclipse.

When the Moon is completely in the Earth’s shadow, it is

to appear dark red in colour and stays that way until the Moon 
moves out of the shadow of the Earth. When part of the Moon 
is in the Earth’s shadow and the rest of the Moon is visible, it 
is called a partial lunar eclipse. Unlike the Sun, we can safely 
watch the eclipsed full Moon with our naked eye.

In a Nutshell
The Earth rotates on its own axis in about 24 hours. 
The Earth’s rotation from West to East causes day and night 
as well as the apparent motion of the Sun, the Moon, and 
the stars.
The Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 1 year 
to complete a revolution.
The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the 
orbit, but is tilted.
Seasons occur because of the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation 
and its spherical shape.
A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is in the path of the 
Sun as seen from the Earth, and sunlight is blocked from 
reaching the Earth. 
A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes in between 
the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight from reaching 
the Moon.
Let Us Enhance Our Learning

3. State whether True or False
(i) Lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun comes between the 
Earth and the Moon.
(ii) Sunrise happens earlier in Gujarat than in Jharkhand.
(iii) In Chennai, the longest day occurs on the summer solstice.
(iv) We should watch the solar eclipse directly with our naked 
eye.
(v) Seasons occur due to the tilt of Earth’s axis of rotation 
and its spherical shape.
(vi) The Earth’s revolution around the Sun causes day and 
night.
4. Padmashree saw the Orion constellation nearly overhead at 8 
pm yesterday. When will she see Orion overhead today?
5. Nandhini saw a group of stars rising at midnight on 21 June. 
When will she see the same group of stars rising at midnight 
next year?
6. Abhay noticed that when it was daytime in India, his uncle 
who was in the USA was generally sleeping as it was night-time 
there. What is the reason behind this diﬀ erence?
7. Four friends used the following ways to see the solar eclipse. 
Who among them was being careless?
(i) Ravikiran used a solar eclipse goggle.
(ii) Jyothi used a mirror to project the Sun’s image.
(iii) Adithya saw the Sun directly with his eyes.
(iv) Aruna attended a programme arranged by a planetarium.
8. Fill in the circles in Fig. 12.18 appropriately with one of the 
following: Sun, Moon, Earth.

9. The Moon is much smaller than the Sun, yet it can block the 
Sun completely from our view during a total solar eclipse. 
Why is it possible?
10. The Indian cricket team matches in Australia are often held 
in December. Should they pack winter or summer clothes for 
their trip?
11. Why do you think lunar eclipses can be seen from a large 
part of the Earth when they happen, but total solar eclipse 
can be seen by only a small part of the Earth?
12. If the Earth’s axis were not tilted with respect to the axis of 
revolution, explain what would be the eﬀ ect on seasons?
Exploratory Projects
Repeat Activity 12.2 but replace the torch with an electric 
lamp. Then place  the globe at diﬀ erent positions on a circle 
around the lamp while maintaining the tilt of the globe.
(i) Note down your observations regarding how much of 
the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the globe are 
illuminated at diﬀ erent positions.
(ii) Rotate the globe and take a note of the length of the day 
and night on diﬀ erent parts of the globe.
(iii) Repeat (ii) for diﬀ erent positions of globe on the circle.
The Earth goes around the Sun in an oval-shaped path. 
Draw two circles with the same centre, one with a radius of 
14.7 cm, and another one with a radius of 15.2 cm. If 1 cm 
corresponds to 10 million km, the two circles represent the 
closest and farthest distances from the Sun. Note how small 
is the diﬀ erence between these two distances.
Suppose the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation increases. Will 
it cause more extreme seasons? Find out if the tilt of Uranus 
is more than the Earth and about the seasons there. Write an 
interesting article for a newspaper or your school magazine 
about it. 
In reality, the planets move around a special point in 
the solar system, which is very close to the Sun but 
not exactly at its centre! The Sun also moves around 
the same point a little instead of staying perfectly still. 
Scientists use such tiny wobbles in the movement of 
other stars to discover exoplanets around them!

It's Still Not the End, My Friend!
y
And once again, we’ve reached the last page of this book, and as 
we said earlier, it is certainly not the end of our curiosity — our 
jigyasa. We hope you’ve enjoyed the activities and experiments as 
you journeyed through the chapters. More importantly, we hope 
you asked a lot of questions! Now it is our time to ask you one.
Have you looked closely at the front and back covers of 
this science textbook? At ﬁ rst, they may just look like regular 
scenes from a playground or a running track, but if you observe 
carefully, you’ll ﬁ nd tiny hidden science clues connected to 
diﬀ erent chapters in the book! Take a closer look — maybe you 
will spot something related to what we discussed about motion 
or light, or maybe even about plants and animals? 
Challenge yourself to ﬁ nd as many science links with the 
chapters as you can (we think there are more than 25!). And 
who knows — you might ﬁ nd connections that the authors and 
illustrators hadn’t even thought about! That is exactly how 
discoveries in science were made — by someone just observing 
something new, something unusual in the world around them.
This textbook is just a small guide, a map to ﬁ nd our way 
around the diﬀ erent paths of science. Never stop asking questions, 
and remember, your curiosity is the spark that lights the ﬂ ame 
of exploration that will take you to incredible heights. And we’ll 
join you again, next year, for more adventures in science.
