Electricity: 
Circuits and their 
Components
Nihal and his classmates were excited for their school trip to the 
Bhakra Nangal Dam. There they would visit the hydroelectric 
power house where the force of falling water was used to generate 
electricity. They also looked forward to the free 13 kilometre- 
train ride from Nangal in Punjab to Bhakra in Himachal Pradesh, 
along the beautiful Sutlej river and through the Shivalik hills.
Prior to the trip, Nihal and his classmates were given a group 
assignment to prepare a presentation on the uses of electricity. 
They began by looking around their houses, then their school, 
followed by their neighbourhood, their city, and ﬁ nally they 
searched the internet. To their astonishment, their list kept 
growing. They decided to organise the uses under diﬀ erent 
headings.

Can you help Nihal by adding some more uses to his lists? 
Also, suggest some other ways of grouping the uses of electricity.
We use electricity all the time, so let us learn something more 
about electricity. You have learnt earlier that electricity is 
generated in multiple ways — by windmills, by using wind 
energy, by solar panels capturing the Sun’s energy, by falling 
water and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter ‘Nature’s 
Treasures’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric 
supply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via 
wires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the 
electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity, 
we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us 
may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like 
a torchlight.
Caution — The danger signs on electric poles and 
other appliances warn people that electricity can 
be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever 
perform experiments with power supply at your 
home or school. Even electricity from portable 
generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or 
cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or 
remotes, for experiments with electricity.
3.1 A Torchlight
g
You might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a ﬂ ashlight.
Activity 3.1: Let us explore
Take a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1.
Observe it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch?
Slide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow?
Now slide the switch back to its original position and observe 
the torch lamp.
You might have noticed that in the ﬁ rst position of the switch, 
the torch lamp glows and in the other position the lamp does not 
glow.
Now, open the torchlight. What do you ﬁ nd inside?
Inside the torchlight, you may ﬁ nd two or more electric cells. 
Why does the torch lamp 
glow in one position of 
its switch?

3.2 A Simple Electrical Circuit
p
To understand how a torch works, let us ﬁ rst ﬁ nd out about its 
components.
3.2.1 Electric cell
Activity 3.2: Let us observe
Take an electric cell, turn it around and look at 
it carefully (Fig. 3.2). Do you notice a positive 
(+) sign and a negative (–) sign marked on the 
electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a 
small protruding metal cap on one side and a 
ﬂ at metal disc on the other side?
All electric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) 
while the other is negative (– ve). The metal cap is the positive
terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative
terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.
3.2.2 Battery
Activity 3.3: Let us experiment
Take a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment 
and take out the cells.
Put the cells back in a diﬀ erent order. Also, try reversing 
the direction of one cell. Then, slide the switch and check 
whether the lamp glows in each case. 
Check the order in which the cells were placed in the torch 
when the lamp glows. 
The lamp glows when the cells are placed in the order as 
shown in Fig. 3.3. Notice how the terminals of the two cells are 
connected. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the 
negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or 
more cells is called a battery.

In a torch, we generally 
use more than one cell. 
Are those placed in any 
particular order?

a 
diﬀ erent kind of lamp. In fact, it 
cannot be taken out of the torch 
as it is ﬁ xed in it. 
(b)
For many devices, we may need more than one cell. So, 
we connect two or more cells together as shown in Fig. 3.3. 
Connecting more than one cell provides energy to the circuit for 
a longer time and/or more energy. 
FASCINATING FACTS
The term battery is also used for a single cell. We use the term battery 
even for the single cell that powers our mobile phones.

For this activity, you will require a torchlight with an 
incandescent lamp (or light bulb). Many old torchlights 
still use such lamps. With your teacher’s help, conﬁ rm 
that your torchlight uses an incandescent lamp.
Take the torch and examine its lamp. What do you 
see? Do you notice a thin wire ﬁ xed in the middle 
of the glass bulb? 
Now, switch on the torch. Which part of the lamp 
glows? 
The thin wire inside the glass bulb of the lamp glows. 
The glowing thin wire is called the ﬁ lament of the lamp. 
Take out the lamp with the help of your teacher and 
inspect it from all sides. How is the ﬁ lament ﬁ xed?
The ﬁ lament is attached to two thicker wires that 
support it, as shown in Fig. 3.4a. One thick wire connects 
to the metal case at the lamp’s base, while the other 
connects to the metal tip at the centre of the base (Fig. 
3.4b). These form the two terminals of the lamp, and 
are ﬁ xed in a way that they do not touch each other. 
In such incandescent lamps, the ﬁ lament gets hot and 
glows to produce light.

LED Lamp
Many torches in use today have a Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp, 
instead of an incandescent lamp, as shown in Fig. 3.5.

Activity 3.5: Let us observe
Take an LED of any colour (Fig. 3.6) and 
observe. Do you see any ﬁ lament inside it?
Notice the length of two wires attached to 
the LED. Do you ﬁ nd one of those longer 
than the other?
Unlike incandescent lamps, LEDs do not 
have ﬁ laments (Fig. 3.6). They also have two 
terminals, but one is positive (attached to a 
longer wire) and the other is negative (the 
shorter wire). A torch may use one or more 
LEDs, sometimes of diﬀ erent shapes, in its 
lamp.
After having learnt about the electric cell, battery, and electric 
lamps, we are now ready to make the torch lamp glow using an 
electric cell or battery.
3.2.4 Making an electric lamp glow using an 
electric cell or battery
Activity 3.6: Let us construct
Take an electric cell, an incandescent lamp used in a torch, a 
cell holder, a lamp holder, and four lengths of electric wire.
Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of 
each wire to expose the metal.
Attach two wires to the two ends of the cell holder as shown 
in Fig. 3.7a.

inside the cell holder (c) Wires connected to an electric cell using electrical tape
Insert the cell in the holder such that its negative terminal 
is towards the spring side of the holder (Fig. 3.7b). In case a 
cell holder is not available, ﬁ x the two wires to the cell using 
electrical tape (Fig. 3.7c).
Attach two wires to the screws of the lamp holder as shown 
in Fig. 3.8a. Fix the lamp in the holder by turning it around in 
the holder (Fig. 3.8b). In case a lamp holder is not available, 
use electrical tape to attach two wires to the two ends of the 
lamp (Fig. 3.8c).

Now, we are ready to connect the cell to the lamp to make it glow.
We will conduct this activity in two parts — prediction and 
observation. Some of the ways in which the lamp and the cell 
can be connected are shown in Table 3.1. 

Predict, for each arrangement, if the lamp will glow or 
not and write your prediction in Table 3.1.

Now, connect the lamp and the cell, and observe if the 
lamp glows or not. Note down your observation in Table 
3.1. Also, for the lamps which glow, colour their glass 
bulbs yellow.

The lamp glows in the arrangements at S.No. 1 and 6 and does 
not glow in the remaining arrangements. Now, carefully look at 
the arrangements in which the lamp glows. Compare these with 
those in which the lamp does not glow. Can you ﬁ nd the reason 
for the diﬀ erence?
3.2.5 An electrical circuit
The lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to 
one terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the 
lamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This 
setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a 
complete path for electric current to ﬂ ow through 
the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes 
through the circuit.
The direction of electric current in an electrical 
circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative 
terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of 
the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell 
by wires, the current passes through the ﬁ lament 
of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With 
an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of 
its terminals connects to the positive or negative 
terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as 
the circuit is complete and current ﬂ ows through 
the ﬁ lament.
FASCINATING FACTS
Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when 
connected to a cell. We say the lamp has ‘fused’ usually due to 
a broken ﬁ lament. A broken ﬁ lament stops the ﬂ ow of current, 
preventing the lamp from glowing.
Let us now try to make an LED glow.
Activity 3.7: Let us experiment
Take two electric cells, an LED of any colour, a cell holder 
that can ﬁ t two cells (Fig. 3.8a), and two lengths of electric 
wire.
Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of 
each wire to expose the metal.
Connect the two wires to the cell holder as shown in 
Fig. 3.10a. 
Fig. 3.9: An electrical circuit
Electricity: Circuits and their Components
Insert two cells in the holder, taking care 
that for each cell, its negative terminal 
is towards the spring side of the holder 
(Fig. 3.10b) and the battery is ready to use. 
How will you decide which is the positive 
terminal of this battery?
The terminal of the holder which is connected 
to the positive terminal of one cell is positive 
and the one connected to the negative terminal 
of the other cell is the negative terminal.
Now, connect the free end of the battery 
positive terminal wire to the longer wire of 
LED, and the free end of the second wire to 
the shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c). Does the 
LED glow?
Repeat the above step but interchange the 
wires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d). 
Does the LED glow again?
You would have observed that the LED glows 
in the ﬁ rst case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in 
the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current 
can pass through the LED in one direction only. 
The current passes through the LED only when 
the positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is 
connected to the positive terminal of the battery, 
and negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED 
is connected to the negative terminal of the 
battery. When current passes through the LED, 
it glows. Always take care to connect an LED 
correctly in a circuit to make it glow.

Sometimes you may come across a device in which the cells are placed 
side by side. Then, how are the terminals of the cells connected?
If you carefully look inside 
the battery compartment, you 
will usually see a thick wire 
or metal strip connecting the 
positive terminal of one cell 
to the negative terminal of 
the next. To help with proper 
placement, ‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols 
are typically printed inside.

Activity 3.8: Let us construct
Collect two drawing pins, a safety pin (or a 
paper clip), two wires, and a small piece of 
cardboard.
Insert a drawing pin through the ring of the 
safety pin and ﬁ x it to the cardboard piece, 
ensuring that the safety pin can rotate freely 
(Fig. 3.11a).
Fix the second drawing pin to the cardboard 
piece so the free end of the safety pin can 
touch it (Fig. 3.11b).
Connect a wire to each drawing pin — our 
switch is ready!
Let us now test our switch.
Activity 3.9: Let us test
Connect the electric cell, lamp, and switch 
as shown in Fig. 3.8a. Does the lamp glow?
Rotate the free end of the safety pin till it 
touches the other drawing pin as shown in 
Fig. 3.8b. Does the lamp glow now?
When the safety pin touches both drawing 
pins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and 
allows the current to ﬂ ow. We call this the ON
position (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed 
and current ﬂ ows from the cell’s positive to 
negative terminal making the lamp glow. When 
the safety pin does not touch the second drawing 
pin, the gap in the circuit prevents current ﬂ ow, 
and the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position 
(Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open.
Note that a switch can be placed anywhere in 
a circuit. A switch is a simple device that either 
completes or breaks a circuit. The switches used 
for lights and other devices at home work the 
same way, though they are designed diﬀ erently.

Electricity: Circuits and their Components
Suppose, we make wires of materials other than 
metal and use them for making the electrical 
circuit. Do you think the electric current will 
pass through those materials in such a circuit?
Activity 3.11: Let us identify
Connect an electric cell and a lamp while 
leaving the two ends of wires free as shown 
in Fig. 3.15a. 
Touch the two free ends of the wires 
momentarily. Does the lamp glow? If yes, 
our tester is ready. We can use this tester 
to identify the materials through which 
electric current passes.
Collect objects of diﬀ erent materials, such 
as metal spoons, coins, cork, rubber, glass, 
keys, pins, plastic scale, wooden block, 
aluminium foil, candle, sewing needle, 
cardboard, paper, and pencil lead.
One by one, touch the free ends of the tester’s 
wires to both ends of each object you have 
collected (Fig. 3.15b). Make sure the wires don’t touch each 
other. Does the lamp glow every time?

Analyse your observations. Did the lamp glow for all 
materials?
The lamp glows for some materials only. This means that 
electric current can pass easily through some materials but not 
through others. The materials through which electric current 
can ﬂ ow easily are called good conductors, or conductors of 
electricity. The materials through which current cannot pass 
through are called insulators, or poor conductors of electricity. 
Based on the observations you have recorded in Table 3.3, 
conclude which materials are conductors of electricity and 
which are insulators. Note it in Table 3.3.
From your conclusions in Table 3.3, you would have realised 
that metals are conductors of electricity, and thus, are used for 
making wires. 
Silver, copper, and gold are the best electrical conductors. 
However, for making electrical wires, mainly copper is used 
due to its comparatively lower cost and abundant supply. 
Diﬀ erent types of electrical wires are used for diﬀ erent uses.
mak
DIVE
EEPER
From Table 3.3, you would have also realised that plastic, 
rubber, and ceramics are electrical insulators. Have you now 
understood why wires are covered with those materials?
Conductors and insulators are both important. Electrical 
wires, switches, connectors of plugs, and sockets are made of 
conductors. Insulators like rubber, plastics, and ceramics are 
used to cover wires, plug tops, and switches to protect people 
from electric shocks.
Caution — Our body is a conductor of electricity. Electric current 
passing through our body may cause severe injury or even death.
Always handle electrical appliances with care. Never touch switches or 
plugs with wet hands, or use electrical devices in wet areas, or handle 
equipment with damaged insulation or broken plugs.
Have you ever wondered how the electricity from a cell or 
battery is diﬀ erent from the electricity coming from a wall 
socket? Electricity from batteries usually powers small 
devices and is of a type called Direct Current (DC). In contrast, 
the electricity from power plants that come to the wall socket 
is known as Alternating Current (AC) and can run larger 
appliances.
