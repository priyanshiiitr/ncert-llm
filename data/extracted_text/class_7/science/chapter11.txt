Light: Shadows and 
Reﬂ ections 
In the Western Ghat region of Maharashtra, Keshav spends 
part of his summer vacation at his friend Jatin’s grandparents’ 
village. Having lived in a big city, he ﬁ nds the forests, fresh 
air, sounds of gushing streams, and chirping birds a novel 
experience.
However, for Keshav, the most fascinating sight is the 
dance of hundreds of ﬁ reﬂ ies at night, ﬂ ashing their lights 
in a wonderful performance. Jatin’s grandparents explain 
that ﬁ reﬂ ies are seasonal insects and they use light to 
communicate. Unfortunately, Keshav also learns the number 
of ﬁ reﬂ ies is decreasing due to light pollution, reduced forest 
cover, and excessive tourism.
At the end of their vacation, Keshav and Jatin board an 
evening bus back to their city. As the bus winds through the 
hilly roads, Keshav watches the moonlit landscape and the 
beams from the headlights of passing vehicles ﬂ ashing by. He 
is reminded of the many poems and songs about moonlight, 
and wonders — does the Moon actually produce its own 
light? Did we not learn in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the 
Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that all other objects in 
our solar system shine only by reﬂ ecting the light of the 
Sun? Is moonlight just reﬂ ected sunlight? Which objects give 
oﬀ  their own light? While thinking, he notices something 
strange — light seems to move in a straight line!

11.1 Sources of Light
g
The Sun gives out or emits its own light and is the main source 
of natural light on the Earth. Stars, lightning, natural ﬁ re, and 
certain animals also emit their own light (Fig. 11.1).
In ancient times, humans learnt to create 
ﬁ re — the earliest form of artiﬁ cial lighting. With 
time, they learnt to create 
ﬁ re using diﬀ erent fuels, 
such as animal fat, oil, 
wax, and gas (Fig. 11.2). 
With the invention of 
electricity and diﬀ erent 
kinds of electric light 
sources, 
most 
of 
the 
lighting needs of humans 
are now met by electric 
lighting (Fig. 11.3).
Objects that emit their own light are 
called luminous objects. Objects that 
do not emit their own light are called 
non-luminous objects. The Moon is a 
non-luminous object. It does not emit its 
own light. It just reﬂ ects the light emitted 
by the Sun that falls on it.
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps are modern light 
sources that consume much less power, are brighter 
and last longer than traditional lamps. This not 
only reduces electricity bills but is also better for 
environment. Recognising their advantages, the 
Indian government has made substantial eﬀ orts to 
promote the use of LED lamps nationwide. At their 
end of life, LED lamps must be appropriately disposed 
or recycled, and not thrown in the garbage.

11.2 Does Light Travel in a Straight Line?

g
Let us do an activity to try to ﬁ nd out.
Activity 11.1: Let us investigate
Take three matchboxes and make a hole in 
the inner tray of each matchbox, exactly at the 
same position.
Arrange these three matchboxes in a straight 
line. Make sure that all three holes are exactly 
at the same height and are in a line as shown 
in Fig. 11.4.
Place a torch light on one side of the matchboxes, ensuring 
that its lamp is at the height of the holes.
Place a cardboard (screen) on the other side of the matchboxes 
and obtain a bright spot on it. (You may need to slightly adjust 
the heights of boxes.)
Move one of the matchboxes slightly to a side or up and down. 
Are you able to obtain the light spot on the screen now?
When all the three holes are not in the same line, we could not 
obtain the light spot on the screen. These observations suggest 
that light travels in a straight line.
Can we somehow 
check it in some 
other way?
I have an idea. Let us try 
to see the candle ﬂ ame 
through a bent pipe! 
Should we also try out this idea? 
Activity 11.2: Let us explore
Caution — Use a lighted candle under adult supervision 
only.
Take a long hollow pipe of some ﬂ exible 
material and align it so that you can see the 
candle ﬂ ame as shown in Fig. 11.5a.
Now, bend the pipe and try to see the candle 
ﬂ ame again (Fig. 11.5b). Can you still see it? 
You could see the candle ﬂ ame through a straight 
pipe but not through a bent pipe. This shows that 
light travels in a straight line.

Caution — Use a laser only under teachers’ supervision. Avoid 
using high-power lasers for this activity; a low-power laser 
pointer is suﬃ  cient. Never point the laser beam directly at 
anyone’s eyes, as it can cause serious eye damage.
Pass 
a 
laser 
beam 
through a beaker ﬁ lled with 
water in which a drop of 
milk is added to make the 
laser beam easily visible. 
What do you observe? Do you see that the 
beam of laser light inside water follows a 
straight path? 
However, light can sometimes even bend 
around corners! This is something you will 
learn in the higher grades.

Fig. 11.6: Passing light 
through different materials
List the materials of the objects in Table 11.1 and classify them 
into transparent, translucent, and opaque (In the chapter 
‘Materials Around Us’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity
you learnt to classify materials into transparent, 
translucent, and opaque, depending on how 
you could see through them).
Go to a dark room, turn on the torch, and place 
it at such a position that you get a spot of light 
from the torch on a wall. Or you may place a 
cardboard screen as shown in Fig. 11.6 and get 
the spot of light on it. 
We will now conduct this activity in two 
parts — prediction and observation.

Predict what will happen if you hold an object in front of 
the light coming out of the torch. Would you continue to 
see the spot of light on the screen? Note your prediction 
in Table 11.1.

Now, actually place the object between the torch and 
the screen. Does light pass through the object? Note your 
observation in Table 11.1.
Repeat this for all the objects.
Was your observation the same as your prediction? What 
conclusions could you draw? Light passes almost completely 
through transparent materials. Light passes partially through 
translucent materials. Light does not pass through opaque
materials.

11.4 Shadow Formation
What did you see on the screen in Activity 11.3 when 
an opaque object was placed in the path of light? Did 
you see a dark patch on the wall? Why was this dark 
patch formed? 
We now know that light travels in a straight line. 
So, when an opaque object is placed in its path, light is 
blocked. The dark patch, where light does not reach, 
is the shadow. 
Fig. 11.7: Shadows around us
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
We have noticed shadows of ourselves and other objects 
around us when we are in the Sun or under a light (Fig. 11.7). 
Also, you might have had fun making diﬀ erent shapes with 
shadows sometime.  
Do translucent and transparent objects create shadows or not? 
Did you notice that in Activity 11.3? Opaque objects form darker 
shadows. Translucent objects make lighter shadows. Even some 
transparent objects can create faint shadows!
Let us learn more about shadows.
Activity 11.4: Let us explore
Collect some opaque objects of diﬀ erent shapes and sizes. 
Repeat Activity 11.3, but this time, carry out the actions 
mentioned in the ﬁ rst column of Table 11.2.
Observe the shape and size of the shadow on the screen for 
each of the actions. 
Did the shadow form in all cases? Was the shape and size of the 
shadow the same as the object?
Record your observations in the second column of Table 11.2.

The object is moved closer to the torch,

What conclusions do you draw from this activity? What do 
we need to observe a shadow? Does the colour of the shadow 
change when the colour of the object is changed?
Shadows are formed when an object blocks light from falling on 
a screen. We need a source of light, an opaque object, and a screen 
Light: Shadows and Reﬂ ections 
to observe a shadow. The walls, ﬂ oor, ground, or any other surface 
acts as a screen for observing shadows in our daily life.
The shape, size, and sharpness of the shadow depend on the 
position of the object relative to the light source and the screen. 
The shadows may give information about the object or we may 
not be able to guess the object at all. Changing the colour of 
opaque objects does not change the colour of the shadows.
FASCINATING FACTS
Shadow play, or shadow puppetry, 
has been a part of our cultural 
heritage for centuries. In this art 
form, ﬂ at cut-out ﬁ gures called 
shadow puppets are placed between 
a light source and a screen. By 
moving the puppets and the light, 
puppeteers 
can 
create 
life-like 
movements, bringing the characters 
to life. Diﬀ erent regions have their 
own unique styles, like the Charma 
Bahuli Natya in Maharashtra, Keelu 
Bomme and Tholu Bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, Togalu Gombeyaata
in Karnataka, Ravana Chhaya in Odisha, Tholpavakoothu in Kerala, and 
Bommalattam in Tamil Nadu. These are used not only for entertainment 
but also communicate important messages to the community.
11.5 Reﬂ ection of Light
g
When the opaque object was a shiny object like a 
polished steel plate, I got a shadow on the screen, 
but I also saw that there was a bright spot of light 
on the wall on the opposite side. Why was it so?
Activity 11.5: Let us investigate
Find a shiny ﬂ at steel plate or a plane mirror, that is, a mirror 
that is ﬂ at and not curved. 
Take it outside and let the sunlight fall on the shiny surface. 
What can you do to redirect light on the wall on which the 
sunlight is not falling directly?
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
What conclusion do you draw from your observations? This 
activity suggests that a shiny surface or a mirror changes the 
direction of light that falls upon it. This change in direction of 
light by a mirror is called the reﬂ ection of light. Let us try to 
understand the reﬂ ection of light by a mirror.
Activity 11.6: Let us experiment
Fig. 11.8: Using mirror to redirect 
sunlight on a wall
Turn the shiny plate or mirror in 
diﬀ erent directions to redirect the 
light onto a wall or a nearby surface 
(Fig. 11.8). Do you see a spot of light 
on the wall? Does it mean that the 
shiny plate or mirror has changed 
the direction of light?
Now, tilt the shiny plate or mirror 
in diﬀ erent ways and observe 
the light spot on the wall. Does it 
change position? Notice how light 
always travels in straight lines and 
changes direction when it falls on 
the shiny plate or mirror.
Take a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a comb, 
a sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper.
Using the black paper, close all openings of the 
comb, except for one to make a thin slit. 
Spread a white paper on a table, hold the comb 
perpendicular to the sheet of paper and shine 
the torch light on the slit. Adjust the comb and 
torch slightly till you see a thin beam of light 
along the paper which has passed through the 
slit (Fig. 11.9a).
Now, place the mirror in the path of the light 
beam while keeping the comb steady (Fig. 11.9b). 
What do you observe?
The path of the light beam is changed after falling 
on the mirror. The reﬂ ection of light occurs at the 
mirror.
mirror.
In a mirror, I can also see my 
face. Is that also due to the 
reﬂ ection of light?

11.6 Images Formed in a Plane Mirror
g
Look into the mirror. Do you see your face in it? What you see is 
a reﬂ ection of your face in the mirror. We also see reﬂ ections of 
other objects that are in front of the mirror. Let us try to ﬁ nd out 
more about this.
Activity 11.7: Let us experiment
Take a plane mirror and a pen or some other object.
Place the pen in front of the mirror as shown in 
Fig. 11.10.
What do you see in the mirror? It appears as if a similar 
pen is placed behind the mirror. The pen which appears 
behind the mirror is the image of the pen formed by the 
mirror. The pen itself is the object.
Now, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the 
mirror and compare the sizes of the images of the pen at 
each position. 
Are the two sizes the same? The image formed by a plane 
mirror is of the same size as the object.
Again, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the 
mirror and observe if the image is upright at each position. 
Does the tip of the pen appear on top at each position? An 
upright image is called erect. An image formed by a plane mirror 
is erect.
Now, place a screen vertically behind the mirror. Move it 
around. Do you get the image on the screen? Repeat this by 
placing the screen in front of the mirror.
The image formed by a plane mirror cannot be obtained on 
a screen.
Activity 11.8: Let us experiment
Stand in front of a plane mirror and look at your image 
(Fig. 11.11). Notice how far it appears to be from the mirror.
Now, stand close to the mirror. Is the image also closer to the 
mirror?
Stand at diﬀ erent distances from the mirror and notice how 
far the image appears to be from the mirror in each case. 
Do you ﬁ nd any relation between your distance from the 
mirror and the distance of your image from the mirror?
Fig. 11.10: Image of a pen 
in a plane mirror
Fig. 11.11: Observing one’s 
own image in a mirror
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
You might have noticed that when you stand close to the 
plane mirror, the image also appears to be close to the mirror. 
The image appears to be far from the mirror when you stand far 
from the plane mirror.
Raise your left arm. Which arm does your image raise?
Touch your right ear. Which ear does your image touch?
You ﬁ nd that your left appears right in your image and your 
right appears left in your image. This type of perceived left-right 
reversal is called lateral inversion. There is lateral inversion in 
the images formed by a plane mirror.

FASCINATING FACTS
When mirrors were invented is not known. Earlier, mirrors 
were made by polishing stone or metal. When glass mirrors 
started being made, the art of making metal mirrors got lost

11.7 Pinhole Camera
A pinhole camera is a device in which the light rays from an 
object pass through a tiny hole (a pinhole) and form an image on 
a screen. 
Light: Shadows and Reﬂ ections 
Activity 11.9: Let us explore
Caution — Use a lighted candle under adult supervision 
only.
Take a piece of cardboard and a candle. Make 
a small hole in the cardboard.
In a dimly lit room, position the cardboard at 
a short distance from a screen.
Place a lighted candle in front of it as shown 
in Fig. 11.12a.
What do you see on the screen? Light coming 
from the ﬂ ame passes through the hole on the 
cardboard and forms an image of the candle ﬂ ame 
on the screen. Do you notice anything surprising? 
The image of the candle ﬂ ame is upside down, that 
is, inverted.
Let us now make a pinhole camera, which you can 
use outdoors.
Activity 11.10: Let us construct
Take two boxes of cardboard such that one can slide 
into another with very little gap in between them. 
Cut open one side of each box. 
On the opposite face of the larger box, make a small 
hole in the middle (Fig. 11.13a). 
On the opposite face of the smaller box, cut out a 
square from the middle with a side of about 5–6 cm. 
Cover this opening with a thin translucent paper 
(like a tracing paper) to form a screen (Fig. 11.13b).
Slide the smaller box inside the larger one in such 
a way that the side with the tracing paper is inside 
(Fig. 11.13c). 
Hold the pinhole camera with the pinhole facing the 
object and look through the open side of the smaller 
box. Cover your head and the camera with a dark cloth. 
Look at a distant object, like a tree or building, in bright 
sunlight and move the smaller box forward or backward 
until an image appears on the tracing paper.
Do the images seen in the camera show the colours 
of the objects on the other side? Are the images erect or 
upside down?

11.8 Making Some Useful Items
g
After having learnt that light travels in a straight line and is 
reﬂ ected by mirrors, it is time to create some useful items based 
on this learning.
11.8.1 Periscope
We can make a simple periscope by 
placing two plane mirrors in a Z-shaped 
box as shown in Fig. 11.14.
Reﬂ ection 
from 
two 
mirrors 
enables us to see objects that are not 
visible directly. Periscopes are used in 
submarines, tanks, or by soldiers to see 
outside their bunkers. You may use it 
to look ahead when standing behind 
taller friends.
11.8.2 Kaleidoscope
Get three rectangular plane mirror 
strips of equal width and join them 
together in a triangular manner as 
shown in Fig. 11.15a. You may use three 
strips of thick reﬂ ective paper instead 
of mirrors. Fix these in a circular tube 
of thick chart paper (Fig. 11.15b). On 
one end of the tube, ﬁ x a transparent 
plastic sheet using a rubber band or 
an adhesive tape. Place several broken 
pieces of coloured bangles or beads on 
this (Fig. 11.15c), and cover it with a 
tracing paper using a rubber band or 
an adhesive tape. 
When you peep through the open 
side, you view a beautiful pattern 
(Fig. 11.15d). Even if you leave both 
sides of the kaleidoscope open and

point it towards a tree or other objects, you see beautiful patterns. 
An interesting feature of the kaleidoscope is that one always gets 
to see a diﬀ erent pattern every time the kaleidoscope is turned 
about. Since there are 3 mirrors, and multiple images (due to 
reﬂ ections of reﬂ ections), many interesting patterns are formed. 
Designers and artists often use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new 
patterns.
In a Nutshell
Objects that emit their own light are called luminous objects.
Light travels in a straight line.
Light passes almost completely through transparent 
materials. Light passes partially through translucent 
materials. Light does not pass through opaque materials.
A shadow is formed when light is blocked by an object. 
Opaque objects form darker shadows. Translucent objects 
make lighter shadows. Some transparent objects can create 
faint shadows.
The change in the direction of light by a mirror is called 
reﬂ ection of light.
The image formed by a plane mirror is of the same size as 
the object, is erect, cannot be obtained on a screen, and is 
laterally inverted.
A pinhole camera creates an inverted image of an object on 
a screen.

FASCINATING FACTS
Light emitted by the Sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach 
the Earth. Hence, if the Sun were to suddenly stop emitting light, we
