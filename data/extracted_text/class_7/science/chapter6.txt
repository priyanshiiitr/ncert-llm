Adolescence:  
A Stage of Growth 
and Change
The journey of a plant generally begins with the germination of a 
seed. With proper nourishment, the seed becomes a sapling and 
matures into a young plant. This journey is marked by some specific 
changes. Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the 
appearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits, 
and new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge.
It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities 
to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs 
to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing 
seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity 
before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch 
into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to 
young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size 
and develop over time.

The journey of life of a human can be divided into different 
stages—infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. 
Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the 
duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another. 
From infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes. 
Until around 10–12 years of age, most changes are related to 
height and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to 
occur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid 
growth and development, typically occurring between the ages 
of 10–19. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood.
Humans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce 
immediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and 
reach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce.
As humans grow and develop, they experience significant 
physical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the 
ability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly 
observable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed. 
In this chapter, you will explore adolescence, understand its 
importance, and learn how to handle it with a sense of responsibility.
6.1	 Growing With Age: The Teenage Years
During the summer vacation, Venkatesh visited his grandparents. 
As he entered the house, his 12-year-old cousin, Devyani came 
running to greet him.
You have become 
so tall, Devyani!
Your voice has 
also changed!
Venkatesh, 
you 
have 
a 
thin 
moustache now!! 
Let us try to understand this interesting conversation 
between Venkatesh and Devyani.
Activity 6.1: Let us discuss

 Write down the changes you can notice among students as 
they go from Grades 5 to 8. These could be related to height, 
strength, behaviour, or any other aspect. Please avoid writing 
names on the slips.

Have you also experienced some of these changes? If yes, then 
it is because you are also reaching this stage gradually. This stage 
starts around 10 years of age and can continue up to the age of 
19. It is usually a stage of development between childhood and 
adulthood, and is called adolescence.
While analysing Table 6.1, you might have noticed the following:
Changes in body structure, weight gain, and 
strength
As boys grow, it might be seen that along with growing 
taller, they gain weight, their shoulders might become 
a bit broader, and their chests may get wider.
	
Girls also undergo changes in height and weight, 
and other body changes like development of breasts. 
Increase in height
From birth, our body undergoes continuous growth 
and development including an increase in height. 
However, the increase in height becomes more 
prominent during adolescence.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Changes in voice
In adolescent boys, the growth of the voice box leads 
to a voice that sounds hoarse. The voice box is a 
structure in our throat that helps us to speak. The 
growth may be seen as a bump in the throat region 
and is called the Adam’s apple. However, it is not 
noticeable in every individual. The voice box also 
grows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the 
boys, leading to only slight changes in voice. 
Changes in facial skin: emergence of pimples
Another common occurrence during the adolescent 
years is a skin condition called acne, in which small, 
reddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible 
on the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily 
secretions from the skin during adolescence that can 
clog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne 
is a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it.
Appearance of hair in different parts of body
Both boys and girls experience the growth of hair in 
different parts of their bodies, such as the armpits and 
pubic region. 
	
Boys often develop facial hair, which later grows 
into a moustache and a beard as they move towards 
adulthood. Some boys may also develop chest hair and 
back hair, though few boys may have no significant 
hair growth. Variations in and timing of appearance of 
hair growth is completely normal.
A key point to remember
Whether it is a change in height, voice, or facial hair, it is 
important to recognise that the timing, nature, and extent 
of these changes vary among individuals. These variations 
are completely normal.
	
Each person experiences adolescence at his or her 
own pace, and its duration also varies from one person to 
another.

Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change
Now, we have understood some of the changes that take place 
during adolescence, particularly those that are easily observable. 
Some of these characteristic changes, like change in voice, the growth 
of facial and chest hair in boys, and the development of breasts 
in girls  are not directly involved in the process of reproduction. 
However, these characteristic changes help distinguish males 
from females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual 
characteristics.
Secondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the 
body is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty. 
Puberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes 
external and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of 
reproduction. 
6.2	 Changes that Indicate Reproductive 
Capability
Adolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also 
by internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such 
change is the maturation of various parts involved in the process 
of reproduction.
Both boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and 
these changes are a natural part of the process of growing up. 
An important internal change associated with adolescent girls is 
the onset of the menstrual cycle. It recurs generally every 28–30 
days and is more commonly known as ‘the period’. Many healthy 
girls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from 
21–35 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process 
and is one of the signs of good reproductive health. The phase of 
the cycle when blood discharge occurs from the body is referred 
to as menstruation. It may last for three to seven days. Some girls 
may feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these 
days. Usually, by the age of 45–55, menstruation stops naturally, 
marking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman’s life.
Breaking myths about menstruation
There are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that 
often lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These 
beliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among 
such myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating 
girls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a 
natural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By 
encouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can 
help society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive 
health of women and contribute positively towards a healthier 
lifestyle for women.
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
Adolescence is not just about physical changes or changes 
associated with reproductive capability but also about emotional 
and behavioural changes. Let us discuss them!
6.3	 Emotional and Behavioural Changes 
in Adolescents
Activity 6.2: Let us list
Take a moment to think if there are any changes in your emotions 
or behaviour or that of your classmates and friends in the past 
one or two years. These changes may be exciting, confusing, or 
both.
Let us list some emotional changes in Table 6.2 along with 
their probable effects on behaviour and ways for positive growth 
and development.

Table 6.2: Emotional changes, their probable effects on behaviour, and 
ways for positive growth  and development
Compassion, involvement in 
social work
While discussing Table 6.2, you may have explored the 
diverse behavioural changes in adolescents. This is because 
adolescence is often marked by stronger emotions than 
childhood. These emotions might affect adolescents’ behaviour 
like taking up/joining social initiatives to support the needy and 
the disadvantaged, or developing deeper interest in new areas.
Understanding how our emotions influence our behaviour 
and actions, can help us make better choices and respond to 
situations thoughtfully.

6.4	 Making Adolescence a Joyful 
Experience
The journey of adolescence is a unique experience. Heightened 
curiosity and excitement during this stage of life give adolescents 
a new viewpoint towards almost everything around them. 
Good habits, thoughtful decisions, and small actions can have a 
powerful positive impact on the overall well-being of adolescents. 
Let us know about them!
6.4.1 Meeting nutritional needs
In Grade 6 chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, 
you learnt about the need for a healthy diet. Since adolescence is 
a period of growth and development marked by several changes 
in the body, a nutritious diet is of utmost importance.
For proper growth, and to perform 
well on the playground, we need 
proteins and carbohydrates!
Not only that, we also need 
an adequate amount of fats, 
vitamins, and minerals as well!
Activity 6.3: Let us list
Based on the locally available foods, fill Table 6.3 with the healthy 
food sources, nutrients present in them and how these nutrients 
can help our growth and development.

Dorothy Hodgkin was a brilliant scientist who studied the 
structure of vitamin B12. In 1964, she became the third 
woman to win the Nobel Prize in the 
field of chemistry. Did you know that 
vitamin B12 is required for the proper 
functioning of the human body? Like 
most vitamins, it cannot be made in the 
human body and has to be obtained 
from the food we eat. Discuss the sources 
of vitamin B12 with your teacher.
6.4.2 Personal hygiene
Besides nutrition, personal hygiene is also crucially important during 
adolescence. Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits 
and the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections.
For girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation 
is essential for both comfort and health. Menstrual hygiene can 
be maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and 
reusable cloth pads designed for this purpose.
The government also attempts to provide these products free 
of charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of 
girls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure 
the availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places 
to promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move 
forward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping 
in menstrual hygiene.
It is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly  by 
wrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This 
is to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness. 
These days, biodegradable sanitary pads are also available that 
are environment-friendly.
Fig. 6.1: Sanitary pad
Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change
Science and Society
To support menstrual hygiene, the government has introduced 
several initiatives—
	
 Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS): Under this scheme by the 
Government of India, sanitary pads are provided free of charge 
or at a reduced price to adolescent girls in rural areas. Awareness 
programmes are also conducted to educate girls about menstrual 
hygiene and health.
	
 Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK): It aims to 
improve the overall health of adolescents, including menstrual 
health and hygiene. It encourages peer education, where older 
students help younger ones learn about these topics.
	
 Suvidha Sanitary Napkin Initiative: Under this initiative, 
biodegradable sanitary pads are provided at affordable prices 
through Jan Aushadhi Kendras. The initiative aims to improve access 
to menstrual hygiene products for women and adolescent girls.
	
 State-Level Initiatives: Various state governments have their 
own programmes, such as the ‘Shuchi Scheme’ in Karnataka 
and free sanitary napkin schemes in states like Tamil Nadu and 
Odisha. These programmes aim to distribute free sanitary pads in 
government schools.
6.4.3 Physical activities
Fig. 6.2: Physical activities for fitness
Regular exercise and physical activities are also very important 
during adolescence. Do you exercise regularly or participate in 
games and sports? What kinds of exercises do you do? These 
activities will keep your body and mind fit and healthy, build up 
your stamina and boost your mood (Fig. 6.2).
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7
6.4.4 Balanced social life
We all live in a society and interact with each other in our day-to-day 
life. We should all be polite and respectful towards each other 
(Fig. 6.3). This helps create a favourable and safe environment.
Since adolescence is a stage of life marked by new experiences 
and emotions, we must be thoughtful and responsible while 
interacting with others — whether in person or through social 
media. This is the time adolescents may feel attracted to their 
peers, and mimic their behaviour. Today, they often interact 
with each other online.
Fig. 6.3: Collaborative learning in action
Modern technologies have made online platforms 
available for all to obtain information, make 
connections, interact, and share information with 
each other. We should use these platforms responsibly 
for the collective well-being of all. Sometimes, we, 
knowingly or unknowingly, use social media platforms 
carelessly. Seeking guidance from elders and teachers 
can help use these platforms positively.
Science and Society
Cyberbullying involves the use of digital devices such as phones, 
computers, or online platforms to harass others by sending misleading 
messages, spreading false rumours, or sharing personal information 
without consent (Fig. 6.4). However, if someone tries to bully you, it is 
important not to feel scared or helpless. Rather, handle it wisely and 
seek help from parents and teachers. 
	
Additionally, you should be cautious when uploading any picture 
online or sharing  personal information with strangers.

6.4.5 Avoiding harmful substances — learn to 
say NO
Some people, including your peers, may tempt, persuade, force or, 
create pressure on you to consume harmful substances such as 
tobacco, gutka, cigarettes, beedi, alcohol, or even life-threatening 
illegal drugs. Since adolescence is marked by curiosity and 
excitement, adolescents might get influenced by such people and try 
these substances.
These substances are not just harmful to physical and mental 
health but are also addictive. This means that once people start 
consuming them, they develop a strong urge to take them again 
and again. Over time, they start using them regularly. This is called 
substance abuse.

Using these substances can cause serious health problems, 
such as breathing difficulties, memory loss, and damage to the 
lungs (Fig. 6.5), depending on the substance. To stay healthy, it is 
important to completely avoid these substances and make healthy 
choices instead. It is important to remain firm and confident in 
your decision to say ‘NO’. 
The first step to overcoming addiction is seeking help and 
support from family and friends, and talking to trusted people, 
such as parents or teachers. Counselling and medical advice can 
also be helpful in handling such situations. Remember, your 
health and your future are in your hands — choose wisely!

Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan
The Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan was launched by the Ministry 
of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. It 
intends to reach out to the masses and spread awareness on the 
issue of avoiding substance abuse through active participation of 
the youth, women, and the community. The special focus is on the 
prevention of substance abuse among early-age children. 
The Government has launched a National De-addiction Helpline— 
14446, to deal with drug addiction and to help drug addicts.
6.5 The ‘Why’ Question for Adolescence
But I wonder why these 
changes occur at this stage 
of life!
We now understand the different 
changes in adolescence and also know 
some ways to handle it with a sense of 
responsibility.
Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and 
other signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones — certain 
chemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial 
role in regulating various aspects of growth and development, 
contributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are 
produced in different parts of the body and are released at an 
appropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some 
hormones influence mood and behaviour. 
Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change
By staying informed, seeking support and guidance when 
needed, and making healthy decisions, you can build a strong 
foundation for your life ahead.
In a Nutshell
	
 Adolescence is the period of change from childhood to 
adulthood. It generally begins around the age of 10 years 
and usually lasts until 19 years.
	
 Adolescence is marked by significant and characteristic 
physical, biological, and emotional changes.
	
 Features that help to distinguish the male from the female 
but are not directly involved in reproduction are called 
secondary sexual characteristics.
	
 Puberty is the stage in which the body of a child undergoes 
observable and internal changes to develop into an adult 
capable of reproduction.
	
 Adolescence in girls is also marked by start of the menstrual 
cycle, during which there is a discharge of blood generally 
after every 28–30 days, a process called menstruation. 
Menstruation begins at puberty and generally ends by the 
age of 45–55 years. 
	
 Adolescents face several emotional and behavioural changes. 
	
 Eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining good 
personal hygiene, and participating in physical activities 
help adolescents to stay healthy. 
	
 Addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, 
have adverse effects on the body and mind. It is wise to say 
‘NO’ to these substances and stay away from them. 
	
 Changes that take place in the body during adolescence are 
primarily controlled by certain chemicals produced in the 
body. These chemicals are called hormones.
	
 Proper guidance and awareness help adolescents manage 
physical, emotional, and behavioural changes effectively.
