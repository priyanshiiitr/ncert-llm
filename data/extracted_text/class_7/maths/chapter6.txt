6.1 Numbers Tell us Things
What do the numbers in the figure below tell us?
Remember the children from the Grade 6 textbook of mathematics? 
Now, they call out numbers using a different rule.
What do you think these numbers mean?
The children rearrange themselves and each one says a number 
based on the new arrangement.
Could you figure out what these numbers convey? Observe and try to 
find out.

The rule is — each child calls out the number of children in front of 
them who are taller than them. Check if the number each child says 
matches this rule in both the arrangements.
Write down the number each child should say based on this rule for 
the arrangement shown below.

2.	 For each of the statements given below, think and identify if it 
is Always True, Only Sometimes True, or Never True. Share your 
reasoning.
(a)	 If a person says ‘0’, then they are the tallest in the group.
(b)	 If a person is the tallest, then their number is ‘0’.
(c)	 The first person’s number is ‘0’.
(d)	 If a person is not first or last in line (i.e., if they are standing 
somewhere in between), then they cannot say ‘0’.
(e)	 The person who calls out the largest number is the shortest.
(f)	 What is the largest number possible in a group of 8 people?

6.2 Picking Parity
Kishor has some number cards and is working on a puzzle: There 
are 5 boxes, and each box should contain exactly 1 number card. The 
numbers in the boxes should sum to 30. Can you help him find a way 
to do it?

= 30
Can you figure out which 5 cards add to 30? Is it possible? 
There are many ways of choosing 5 cards from this collection. 
Is there a way to find a solution without checking all possibilities? 
Let us find out.
Add a few even numbers together. What kind of number do you get? 
Does it matter how many numbers are added?
Any even number can be arranged in pairs without any leftovers. 
Some even numbers are shown here, arranged in pairs.
 
As we see in the figure, adding any number of even numbers
will result in a number which can still be arranged in pairs 
without any leftovers. In other words, the sum will always be an 
even number.
Now, add a few odd numbers together. What kind of number do you 
get? Does it matter how many odd numbers are added?
Odd numbers can not be arranged in pairs. An odd number is one 
more than a collection of pairs. Some odd numbers are shown below:
 
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Can we also think of an odd number as one less than a collection 
of pairs?
This figure shows that the sum of two odd numbers must always 
be even! This along with the other figures here are more examples 
of a proof!
We can see that 
two odd numbers added 
together can always be 
arranged in pairs.
What about adding 3 odd numbers? Can the resulting sum be arranged 
in pairs? No. 
Explore what happens to the sum of (a) 4 odd numbers, (b) 5 odd 
numbers, and (c) 6 odd numbers.
Let us go back to the puzzle Kishor was trying to solve. There are 
5 empty boxes. That means he has an odd number of boxes. All the 
number cards contain odd numbers.
They should add to 30, which is an even number. Since, adding any 
5 odd numbers will never result in an even number, Kishor cannot 
arrange these cards in the boxes to add up to 30.
Two siblings, Martin and Maria, were born exactly one year apart. 
Today they are celebrating their birthday. Maria exclaims that the sum 
of their ages is 112. Is this possible? Why or why not?
As they were born one year apart, their ages will be (two) consecutive 
numbers. Can their ages be 51 and 52? 51 + 52 = 103.  Try some other 
consecutive numbers and see if their sum is 112.
The counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... alternate between even and odd 
numbers. In any two consecutive numbers, one will always be even 
and the other will always be odd!
What would be the resulting sum of an even number and an odd 
number? We can see that their sum can’t be arranged in pairs and thus 
will be an odd number.
Number Play
Since 112 is an even number, and Martin’s and Maria’s ages are 
consecutive numbers, they cannot add up to 112.
We use the word parity to denote the property of being even or odd. 
For instance, the parity of the sum of any two consecutive numbers is 
odd. Similarly, the parity of the sum of any two odd numbers is even.
Figure it Out
1.	 Using your understanding of the pictorial representation of odd 
and even numbers, find out the parity of the following sums:
(a)	 Sum of 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers (e.g., even + even 
+ odd + odd)
(b)	 Sum of 2 odd numbers and 3 even numbers
(c)	 Sum of 5 even numbers
(d)	 Sum of 8 odd numbers
2.	 Lakpa has an odd number of ₹1 coins, an odd number of ₹5 coins 
and an even number of ₹10 coins in his piggy bank. He calculated 
the total and got ₹205. Did he make a mistake? If he did, explain 
why. If he didn’t, how many coins of each type could he have?
3.	 We know that:
(a)	 even + even	 = even
(b)	 odd + odd	
= even
(c)	 even + odd	 = odd
Similarly, find out the parity for the scenarios below:
(d)	 even – even	 =  ___________________
(e)	 odd – odd	
=  ___________________
(f)	 even – odd	
=  ___________________
(g)	 odd – even	
=  ___________________
Small Squares in Grids
In a 3 × 3 grid, there are 9 small squares, 
which is an odd number. Meanwhile, in 
a 3 × 4 grid, there are 12 small squares, 
which is an even number.
Given the dimensions of a grid, can you 
tell the parity of the number of small 
squares without calculating the product?
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Find the parity of the number of small squares in these grids:
(a)	 27 × 13
(b)	 42 × 78
(c)	 135 × 654
Parity of Expressions

expression has different parity:

Come up with an expression that always has even parity.
Some examples are: 100p and 48w – 2. Try to find more.
Come up with expressions that always have odd parity.
Come up with other expressions, like 3n + 4, which could have either 
odd or even parity.
The expression 6k + 2 evaluates to 8, 14, 20,... (for k = 1, 2, 3,...) — many 
even numbers are missing. 
Are there expressions using which we can list all the even numbers?
Hint: All even numbers have a factor 2.
Are there expressions using which we can list all odd numbers?
We saw earlier how to express the nth term of the sequence of 
multiples of 4, where n is the letter-number that denotes a position in 
the sequence (e.g., first, twenty third, hundred and seventeenth, etc.).
What would be the nth term for multiples of 2? Or, what is the nth even 
number?
Let us consider odd numbers.
What is the 100th odd number?
To answer this question, consider the following question:
Number Play
What is the 100th even number?
This is 2 × 100 = 200.
Does this help in finding the 100th odd number? Let us compare the 
sequence of evens and odds term-by-term.
Even Numbers:	
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,...
Odd Numbers:	
1, 3, 5, 7,  9,  11,...
We see that at any position, the value at the odd number sequence 
is one less than that in the even number sequence. Thus, the 100th odd 
number is 200 – 1 = 199.
Write a formula to find the nth odd number.
Let us first describe the method that we have learnt to find the odd 
number at a given position:
(a)	 Find the even number at that position. This is 2 times the 
position number. 
(b)	 Then subtract 1 from the even number.
Writing this in expressions, we get
(a)	 2n
(b)	 2n – 1
Thus, 2n is the formula that gives the nth even number, and 2n – 1 is 
the formula that gives the nth odd number.
6.3 Some Explorations in Grids
Observe this 3 × 3 grid. It is filled following a simple 
rule — use numbers from 1 – 9 without repeating 
any of them. There are circled numbers outside the 
grid.
Are you able to see what the circled numbers 
represent?
The numbers in the yellow circles are the sums of the corresponding 
rows and columns.

Make a couple of questions like this on your own and challenge your 
peers.
Try solving the problem below.
You might have realised that it is not possible to 
find a solution for this grid. Why is this the case?
The smallest sum possible is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. The 
largest sum possible is 24 = 9 + 8 + 7. Clearly, any 
number in a circle cannot be less than 6 or 
greater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26. 
Therefore, this is impossible!
In the earlier grids which we solved, 
Kishor noticed that the sum of all the 
numbers in the circles was always 90. Also, 
Vidya observed that the sum of the circled 
numbers for all three rows, or for all three 
columns, was always 45. Check if this is true 
in the previous grids you have solved.
Why should the row sums and column sums 
always add to 45?
From this grid, we can see that all the 
row sums added together will be the same 
as the sum of the numbers 1 – 9. This can be 
seen for column sums as well. The sum of 
the numbers 1 – 9 is
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.
A square grid of numbers is called a 
magic square if each row, each column and 
each diagonal, add up to the same number. 
This number is called the magic sum. 
Diagonals are shown in the picture.   
Trying to create a magic square by randomly filling 
the grid with numbers may be difficult! This is because 
there are a large number of ways of filling a 3 × 3 grid 
using the numbers 1 – 9 without repetition. In fact, it 
can be found that there are exactly 3,62,880 such ways. 
Surprisingly, the number of ways to fill in the grid can be 
found without listing all of them. We will see in later years how to do this.
Instead, we should proceed systematically to make a magic square. 
For this, let us ask ourselves some questions.
1.	 What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number?

Number Play
Let us focus, for the moment, only on the row sums. We have seen that 
in a 3 × 3 grid with numbers 1 – 9, the total of row sums will always be 
45. Since in a magic square the row sums are all equal, and they add up 
to 45, they have to be 15 each. Thus, we have the following observation.
Observation 1: In a magic square made using the numbers 1 – 9, the 
magic sum must be 15.
2.	 What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a 
magic square?
Let us consider the possibilities one by one. 
Can the central number be 9? If yes, then 8 must 
come in one of the other squares. For example,
In this, we must have 8 + 9 + other number = 15.
But this is not possible! The same issue will 
occur no matter where we place 8.
So, 9 cannot be at the centre. Can the central 
number be 1?
If yes, then 2 should come in one of the other 
squares. 
Here, we must have 2 + 1 + other number = 15.
But this is not possible because we are only 
using the numbers 1 – 9. The same issue will 
occur no matter where we place 1.
So, 1 cannot be at the centre, either.
Using such reasoning, find out which other 
numbers 1 – 9 cannot occur at the centre.
This exploration will lead us to the following 
interesting observation.
Observation 2: The number occurring at 
the centre of a magic square, filled using 1 – 9, 
must be 5.
Let us now see where the smallest number 1 
and the largest number 9 should come in a magic 
square. Our second observation tells us that 
they will have to come in one of the boundary 
positions. Let us classify these positions into two categories:  
9
2
135
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Can 1 occur in a corner position? For example,
can it be placed as follows?
If yes, then there should exist three ways of 
adding 1 with two other numbers to give 15. 
We have 1 + 5 + 9 = 1 + 6 + 8 = 15. Is any other 
combination possible?
Similarly, can 9 can be placed in a corner position?
Observation 3: The numbers 1 and 9 cannot occur in any corner, so 
they should occur in one of the middle positions.
Can you find the other possible positions for 1 and 9?
Now, we have one full row or column of the magic square!
Try completing it! 
[Hint: First fill the row or columns containing 1 and 9]
Figure it Out
1.	 How many different magic squares can be made using the 
numbers 1 – 9? 
2.	 Create a magic square using the numbers 2 – 10. What strategy 
would you use for this? Compare it with the magic squares 
made using 1 – 9.
3.	 Take a magic square, and 
(a)	 increase each number by 1
(b)	 double each number
In each case, is the resulting grid also a magic square? How do the 
magic sums change in each case?
4.	 What other operations can be performed on a magic square to 
yield another magic square?
5.	 Discuss ways of creating a magic square using any set of 9 
consecutive numbers (like 2 – 10, 3 – 11, 9 – 17, etc.).  
Generalising a 3 × 3 Magic Square

Magic Squares in History and Culture
The first magic square ever recorded, the Lo Shu Square, dates 
back over 2000 years to ancient China. The legend tells of a 
catastrophic flood on the Lo River, during which the gods sent 
a turtle to save the people. The turtle carried a 3 × 3 
grid on its back, with the numbers 1 to 9 arranged in 
a magical pattern.
Magic squares were studied in different parts of 
the world at different points of time including India, Japan, 
Central Asia, and Europe.
Indian mathematicians have worked extensively on magic 
squares, describing general methods of constructing them. 
The work of Indian mathematicians was not just limited to 3 × 3 and 
4 × 4 grids, which we considered above, but also extended to 5 × 5 and 
other larger square grids. We shall learn more about these in 
later grades.
The occurrence of magic squares is not limited to scholarly 
mathematical works. They are found in many places in India. 
The picture to the right is of a 3 × 3 magic square found on 
a pillar in a temple in Palani, Tamil Nadu. The temple dates 
back to the 8th century CE.
3 × 3 magic squares can also be found in homes and shops in 
India. The Navagraha Yantra is one such example shown below.

6.4 Nature’s Favourite Sequence: The Virahāṅka–
Fibonacci Numbers!
The sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . .  (Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers) 
is one of the most celebrated sequences in all of mathematics — it 
occurs throughout the world of Art, Science, and Mathematics. Even 
though these numbers are found very frequently in Science, it is 
remarkable that these numbers were first discovered in the context of 
Art (specifically, poetry)! 
The Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers thus provide a beautiful 
illustration of the close links between Art, Science, and Mathematics.
Discovery of the Virahāṅka Numbers
The Virahāṅka numbers first came up thousands of years ago in the 
works of Sanskrit and Prakrit linguists in their study of poetry!
In the poetry of many Indian languages, including, Prakrit, Sanskrit, 
Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, each syllable is classified as 
either long or short. 
A long syllable is pronounced for a longer duration than a short 
syllable — in fact, for exactly twice as long. When singing such a poem, 
a short syllable lasts one beat of time, and a long syllable lasts two 
beats of time.
This leads to numerous mathematical questions, which the ancient 
poets in these languages considered extensively. A number of important 
mathematical discoveries were made in the process of asking and 
answering these questions about poetry. 
One of these particularly important questions was the following.
How many rhythms are there with 8 beats consisting of short syllables 
(1 beat) and long syllables (2 beats)? That is, in how many ways can one 
20

fill 8 beats with short and long syllables, where a short syllable takes 
one beat of time and a long syllable takes two beats of time.
Here are some possibilities: 
long long long long
short short short short short short short short
short long long short long
long long short short long
	
      .
	
      .
	
      .
Can you find others?
Phrased more mathematically: In how many different ways can one 
write a number, say 8, as a sum of 1’s and 2’s?
For example, we have:
	
	
	
	
	
8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2,
	
	
	
	
	
8 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1,
	
	
	
	
	
8 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2,
	
	
	
	
	
8 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2,
	
	
	
	
	
etc.
Do you see other ways?
Here are all the ways of writing each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
as the sum of 1’s and 2’s.

Try writing the number 5 as a sum of 1s and 2s in all possible ways 
in your notebook! How many ways did you find? (You should find 8 
different ways!) Can you figure out the answer without listing down all 
the possibilities? Can you try it for n = 8? 
Here is a systematic way to write down all rhythms of short and long 
syllables having 5 beats. Write a ‘1+’ in front of all rhythms having 4 
beats, and then a ‘2+’ in front of all rhythms having 3 beats. This gives 
us all the rhythms having 5 beats:     
Number Play
n = 5
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 2
1 + 1 + 2 + 1
1 + 2 + 1 + 1
1 + 2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 2
2 + 2 + 1
Thus, there are 8 rhythms having 5 beats!
The reason this method works is that every 5-beat rhythm must begin 
with either a ‘1+’ or a ‘2+’. If it begins with a ‘1+’, then the remaining 
numbers must give a 4-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. 
If it begins with a 2+, then the remaining number must give a 3-beat 
rhythm, and we can write all those down. Therefore, the number of 
5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat rhythms, plus the number of 
3-beat rhythms.
How many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will 
be the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms, 
i.e., 8 + 5 = 13. Thus, there are 13 rhythms having 6 beats.
Use the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write 
6 as the sum of 1’s and 2’s in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways?
This beautiful method for counting all the rhythms of short syllables 
and long syllables having any given number of beats was first given by 
the great Prakrit scholar Virahāṅka around the year 700 CE. He gave 
his method in the form of a Prakrit poem! For this reason, the sequence 
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . is known as the Virahāṅka sequence, and 
the numbers in the sequence are known as the Virahāṅka numbers. 
Virahāṅka was the first known person in history to explicitly consider 
these important numbers and write down the rule for their formation.
Other scholars in India also considered these numbers in the 
same poetic context. Virahāṅka was inspired by earlier work of the 
legendary Sanskrit scholar Piṅgala, who lived around 300 BCE. After 
Virahāṅka, these numbers were also written about by Gopala (c. 1135 
CE) and then by Hemachandra (c. 1150 CE).
In the West, these numbers have been known as the Fibonacci 
numbers, after the Italian mathematician who wrote about them in 
the year 1202 CE — about 500 years after Virahāṅka. As we can see, 
Fibonacci was not first, nor the second, not even the third person to 
write about these numbers! Sometimes the term “Virahāṅka–Fibonacci 
numbers” is used so that everyone understands what is being referred 
to.
So, how many rhythms of short and long syllables are there having 
8 beats? We simply take the 8th element of the Virahāṅka sequence:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... 
Thus, there are 34 rhythms having 8 beats.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Write the next number in the sequence, after 55.
We have seen that the next number in the sequence is given by 
adding the two previous numbers. Check that this holds true for the 
numbers given above. The next number is 34 + 55 = 89.
Write the next 3 numbers in the sequence:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 , 55, 89, ____, ____, ____, …
If you have to write one more number in the sequence above, can 
you tell whether it will be an odd number or an even number (without 
adding the two previous numbers)?
What is the parity of each number in the sequence? Do you notice any 
pattern in the sequence of parities?
Today, the Virahāṅka–Fibonacci numbers form the basis of many 
mathematical and artistic theories, from poetry to drumming, to 
visual arts and architecture, to science. Perhaps the most stunning 
occurrences of these numbers are in nature. For example, the number 
of petals on a daisy is generally a Virahāṅka number.
How many petals do you see on each of these flowers?
A daisy with 13 
petals
A daisy with 21 
petals
A daisy with 34 
petals
There

6.5 Digits in Disguise
You have done arithmetic operations with numbers. How about doing 
the same with letters?

stands for a particular digit (0 – 9). You have to figure out which digit 
each letter stands for.

Here, we have a one-digit number that, when added to itself twice, 
gives a 2-digit sum. The units digit of the sum is the same as the single 
digit being added. 
What could U and T be? Can T be 2? Can it be 3?
Once you explore, you will see that T = 5 and UT = 15.
Let us look at one more example shown on the right. 
Here K2 means that the number is a 2-digit number 
having the digit ‘2’ in the units place and ‘K’ in the tens place. K2 is 
added to itself to give a 3-digit sum HMM. What digit should the letter 
M correspond to? 
Both the tens place and the units place of the sum have the same 
digit. 
What about H? Can it be 2? Can it be 3?
These types of questions can be interesting and fun to solve! Here

2.	 Liswini has a large old encyclopaedia. When she opened it, several 
loose pages fell out of it. She counted 50 sheets in total, each printed 
on both sides. Can the sum of the page numbers of the loose sheets 
be 6000? Why or why not?
3.	 Here is a 2 × 3 grid. For each row and column,
the parity of the sum is written in the circle; ‘e’ 
for even and ‘o’ for odd. Fill the 6 boxes with 3 
odd numbers (‘o’) and 3 even numbers (‘e’) to 
satisfy the parity of the row and column sums.
4.	 Make a 3 × 3 magic square with 0 as the magic 
sum. All numbers can not be zero. Use negative numbers, as needed.
5.	 Fill in the following blanks with ‘odd’ or ‘even’:
(a)	 	Sum of an odd number of even numbers is 	 ______
(b)	 	Sum of an even number of odd numbers is 	 ______
(c)	 	Sum of an even number of even numbers is 	 ______
(d)	 	Sum of an odd number of odd numbers is 	
______
6.	 What is the parity of the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100?
7.	 Two consecutive numbers in the Virahāṅka sequence are 987 and 
1597. What are the next 2 numbers in the sequence? What are the 
previous 2 numbers in the sequence?
8.	 Angaan wants to climb an 8-step staircase. His playful rule is that 
he can take either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. For example, one of 
his paths is 1, 2, 2, 1, 2. In how many different ways can he reach 
the top?
9.	 What is the parity of the 20th term of the Virahāṅka sequence?
10.	Identify the statements that are true.
(a)	 	The expression 4m – 1 always gives odd numbers.
(b)	 	All even numbers can be expressed as 6j – 4.
(c)	 	Both expressions 2p + 1 and 2q – 1 describe all odd numbers.
(d)	 	The expression 2f + 3 gives both even and odd numbers.

In this chapter, we have explored the following:
•	 In the first activity, we saw how to represent information about how 
a sequence of numbers (e.g., height measures) is arranged without 
knowing the actual numbers.
•	 We learnt the notion of parity — numbers that can be arranged in 
pairs (even numbers) and numbers that cannot be arranged in pairs 
(odd numbers).
•	 We learnt how to determine the parity of sums and products.
•	 While exploring sums in grids, we could determine whether filling 
a grid is impossible by looking at the row and column sums. We 
extended this to construct magic squares.
•	 We saw how Virahāṅka numbers were first discovered in history 
through the Arts. The Virahāṅka sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 
55, ... 
•	 We became math-detectives through cryptarithms, where digits are 
replaced by letters.
SUMMARY
I just heard 
that 14,70,369 
people got 
married last 
year.
Wait, shouldn’t 
it be an even 
number?
