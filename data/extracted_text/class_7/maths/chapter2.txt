2.1 Simple Expressions
You may have seen mathematical phrases like 13 + 2, 20 – 4, 12 × 5, and 
18 ÷ 3. Such phrases are called arithmetic expressions. 
Every arithmetic expression has a value which is the number it 
evaluates to. For example, the value of the expression 13 + 2 is 15. This 
expression can be read as ‘13 plus 2’ or ‘the sum of 13 and 2’.
We use the equality sign ‘=’ to denote the relationship between an 
arithmetic expression and its value. For example:
13 + 2 = 15.
Example 1: Mallika spends ₹25 every day for lunch at school. Write 
the expression for the total amount she spends on lunch in a week 
from Monday to Friday.
The expression for the total amount is 5 × 25.
5 × 25 is  “5 times 25” or “the product of 5 and 25”. 
Different expressions can have the same value. Here are multiple 
ways to express the number 12, using two numbers and any of the four 
operations +, – ,  × and ÷:
10 + 2, 15 – 3, 3 × 4, 24 ÷ 2.
Choose your favourite number and write as many expressions as you 
can having that value.
Comparing Expressions
As we compare numbers using ‘=’, ‘<’ and ‘>’ signs, we can also compare 
expressions. We compare expressions based on their values and write 
the ‘equal to’, ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ sign accordingly. For example, 
10 + 2 > 7 + 1

because the value of 10 + 2 = 12  is greater than the value of 7 + 1 =  8. 
Similarly, 
13 – 2 < 4 × 3.

1.	 	Fill in the blanks to make the expressions equal on both sides of 
the = sign:
(a)	 13 + 4 = ____ + 6 	
(b)	 22 +  ____  = 6 × 5   
(c)	 8 × ____ = 64 ÷ 2	
(d)	 34 – ____ = 25
2.	 	Arrange the following expressions in ascending (increasing) order 
of their values. 
(a)	 67 – 19	
(b)	 67 – 20
(c)	 35 + 25	
(d)	 5 × 11
(e)	 120 ÷ 3
Example 2: Which is greater? 1023 + 125 or 1022 + 128? 
Imagining a situation could help us answer this 
without finding the values. Raja had 1023 marbles 
and got 125 more today. Now he has 1023 + 125 
marbles. Joy had 1022 marbles and got 128 
more today. Now he has 1022 + 128 marbles.  Who 
has more?
This situation can be represented as shown in 
the picture on the right. To begin with, Raja had 1 
more marble than Joy. But Joy got 3 more marbles 
than Raja today. We can see that Joy has (two) 
more marbles than Raja now.
That is,  
	
	
	
1023 + 125 < 1022 + 128.
Example 3: Which is greater? 113 – 25 or 112 – 24? 
Imagine a situation, Raja had 113 marbles and lost 
25 of them. He has 113 – 25 marbles. Joy had 112 
marbles and lost 24 today. He has 112 – 24 marbles. 
Who has more marbles left with them?
Raja had 1 marble more than Joy. But he also 
lost 1 marble more than Joy did. Therefore, they 
have an equal number of marbles now.
That is, 
113 – 25 = 112 – 24.

2.2 Reading and Evaluating Complex Expressions 
Sometimes, when an expression is not accompanied by a context, there 
can be more than one way of evaluating its value. In such cases, we 
need some tools and rules to specify how exactly the expression has to 
be evaluated. 
To give an example with language, look 
at the following sentences:   
(a)	 Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a 
friend with toys”.  
	
Meaning: The friend has toys and 
Shalini sat next to her.
(b)   Sentence:   “Shalini sat next to a 
friend, with toys”. 
	
Meaning: Shalini has the toys 
and she sat with them next to her 
friend. 
This sentence without the punctuation could have been interpreted 
in two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how 
the sentence has to be understood.
Let us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way.
Example 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun 
brought 5 bags of marbles with 4 marbles in each bag. How many 
marbles did Mallesh and Arun bring to the playground?
Mallesh summarized this by writing the mathematical expression —
30 + 5 × 4.
Arithmetic Expressions
Without knowing the context behind this expression, Purna found 
the value of this expression to be 140. He added 30 and 5 first, to get 35, 
and then multiplied 35 by 4 to get 140.
Mallesh found the value of this expression to be 50. He multiplied 5 
and 4 first to get 20 and added 20 to 30 to get 50. 
In this case, Mallesh is right. But why did Purna get it wrong? 
Just looking at the expression 30 + 5 × 4, it is not clear whether we 
should do the addition first or multiplication. 
Just as punctuation marks are used to resolve confusions in language, 
brackets and the notion of terms are used in mathematics to resolve 
confusions in evaluating expressions.
Brackets in Expressions
In the expression to find the number of marbles — 30 + 5 × 4 — we had 
to first multiply 5 and 4, and then add this product to 30. This order of 
operations is clarified by the use of brackets as follows:
30 + (5 × 4).
When evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find 
the values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing 
other operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value 
of 5 × 4, and then do the addition. Thus, this expression describes the 
number of marbles:
30 + (5 × 4 ) = 30 + 20 = 50.
Example 5: Irfan bought a pack of biscuits for ₹15 and a packet of toor 
dal for ₹56. He gave the shopkeeper ₹100. Write an expression that can 
help us calculate the change Irfan will get back from the shopkeeper.
Irfan spent ₹15 on a biscuit packet and ₹56 on toor dal. So, the total 
cost in rupees is 15 + 56. He gave ₹100 to the shopkeeper. So, he should 
get back 100 minus the total cost. Can we write that expression as—
100 – 15 + 56 ? 
Can we first subtract 15 from 100 and then add 56 to the result? We 
will get 141. It is absurd that he gets more money than he paid the 
shopkeeper!
We can use brackets in this case:
100 – (15 + 56).
Evaluating the expression within the brackets first, we get 100 minus 
71, which is 29. So, Irfan will get back ₹29.

Terms in Expressions
Suppose we have the expression 30 + 5 × 4 without any brackets. Does 
it have no meaning? 
When there are expressions having multiple operations, and the 
order of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion 
of terms to determine the order.
Terms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For 
example, in 12+7, the terms are 12 and 7, as marked below.
7
+
12 + 7 =
We will keep marking each term of an expression as above. Note 
that this way of marking the terms is not a usual practice. This will be 
done until you become familiar with this concept.
Now, what are the terms in 83 – 14? We know that subtracting a 
number is the same as adding the inverse of the number. Recall that 
the inverse of a given number has the sign opposite to it. For example, 
the inverse of 14 is –14, and the inverse of –14 is 14. Thus, subtracting 
14 from 83 is the same as adding –14 to 83. That is,
– 14
+
83 – 14 =
 
Thus, the terms of the expression 83 – 14 are 83 and –14. 
Check if replacing subtraction by addition in this way does not change 
the value of the expression, by taking different examples.
Can you explain why subtracting a number is the same as adding its 
inverse, using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 
6 textbook of mathematics? 
All subtractions in an expression are converted to additions in this 
manner to identify the terms.
Here are some more examples of expressions and their terms:
– 18
– 3
+
–18 – 3 =
6 × 5
+
6 × 5 + 3 =
– 10
+
2 – 10 + 4 × 6 =
4 × 6
+
Note that 6 × 5, 4 × 6 are single terms as they do not have any ‘+’ sign.
In the following table, some expressions are given. Complete the table.

Now we will see how terms are used to determine the order of 
operations to find the value of an expression. 
We will start with expressions having only additions (with all the 
subtractions suitably converted into additions).
Does changing the order in which the terms are added give different 
values?
Swapping and Grouping
Let us consider a simple expression having only two terms.
Example 6: Madhu is flying a drone from a terrace. The drone goes 6 m 
up and then 4 m down. Write an expression to show how high the final 
position of the drone is from the terrace.
The drone is 6 – 4 = 2 m above the terrace. Writing it as sum of terms:
– 4
+
=
Will the sum change if we swap the terms?
– 4
 6
+
=
It doesn’t in this case.
We already know that swapping the terms does not change the sum 
when both the terms are positive numbers.
Will this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as 
well? Take some more expressions and check. 
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of  
integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? 
Thus, in an expression having two terms, swapping them does not 
change the value.
Term 1

Now consider an expression having three terms: (–7) + 10 + (–11). Let 
us add these terms in the following two different orders:
– 7
 10
+
– 11
+
(adding the first two terms and then adding their sum to the third 
term)
– 7
 10
+
– 11
+
(adding the last two terms and then adding their sum to the first 
term)
What do you see? The sums are the same in both cases.
Again, we know that while adding positive numbers, grouping them 
in any of the above two ways gives the same sum. 
Will this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as 
well? Take some more expressions and check. 
Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of 
integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? 
Thus, grouping the terms of an expression in either of the following 
ways gives the same value.
Term 1

Let us consider the expression (–7) + 10 + (–11) again. What happens 
when we change the order and add –7 and –11 first, and then add this 
sum to 10? Will we get the same sum as before?
We see that adding the terms of the expression (–7) + 10 + (–11) in 
any order gives the same sum of –8.

Does adding the terms of an expression in any order give the same 
value? Take some more expressions and check. Consider expressions 
with more than 3 terms also. 
Can you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of 
integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? 
Thus, the addition of terms in any order gives the same value.
Therefore, in an expression having only additions, it does not matter 
in what order the terms are added: they all give the same value.
Now let us consider expressions having multiplication and division 
also, without the order of operations specified by the brackets. The 
values of such expressions are found by first evaluating the terms. 
Once all the terms are evaluated, they are added. 
For example, the expression 30 + 5 × 4 is evaluated as follows:
30
5 × 4
+
+
30 + 5 × 4 =
=
=
The expression 5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 is evaluated as follows:
5 × (3 + 2)
+
5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 =
+
7 × 8
Where (3+2) is first evaluated and this sum is multiplied by 5 (= 25). 
The expression 7 × 8 is evaluated (= 56). This simplifies to 25 + 56 + 3 = 
84.
Manasa is adding a long list of numbers. It took her five 
minutes to add them all and she got the answer 11749. Then 
she realised that she had forgotten to include the fourth 
number 9055. Does she have to start all over again?
In mathematics we use the phrase commutative property 
of addition instead of saying “swapping terms does not 
change the sum”. Similarly, “grouping does not change the sum” is 
called the associative property of addition.

Example 7: Amu, Charan, Madhu, and John went to a hotel and ordered 
four dosas. Each dosa cost ₹23, and they wish to thank the waiter by 
tipping ₹5. Write an expression describing the total cost.
Cost of 4 dosas = 4 × 23

Removing Brackets — I
Let us find the value of this expression,
200 – (40 + 3).
We first evaluate the expression inside the 
bracket to 43 and then subtract it from 200. 
But it is simpler to first subtract 40 from 200:
200 – 40 = 160.
And then subtract 3 from 160:
160 – 3 = 157.
What we did here was 200 – 40 – 3. Notice, that we did not do 
200 – 40 + 3.
So,
200 – (40 + 3) = 200 – 40 – 3.
Example 12: We also saw this earlier in the case of Irfan purchasing a 
biscuit packet (₹15) and a toor dal packet (₹56). When he paid ₹100, the 
change he gets in rupees is: 
100 – (15 + 56) = 29.
The change could also have been calculated as follows: 
(a)	 First subtract the cost of the biscuit packet (15) from 100: 
100 – 15 = 85.
	
This is the amount the shopkeeper owes Irfan if he had 
purchased only the biscuits. As he has purchased toor dal 
also, its cost is taken from this remaining amount of 85. 
(b)	 So, to find the change, we need to subtract the cost of toor 
dal from 85.
85 – 56 = 29.
	
What we have done here is 100 – 15 – 56. So,
100 – (15 + 56) = 100 – 15 – 56.
Notice how upon removing the brackets preceded by a negative 
sign, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. Observe

the signs of 40 and 3 in the first example, and that of 15 and 56 in 
the second.
Example 13: Consider the expression 500 – (250 – 100). Is it possible to 
write this expression without the brackets?
To evaluate this expression, we need to subtract 250 – 100 = 150 
from 500:
500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 150 = 350.
If we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have 
subtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back 
that 100 to 500 – 250 to make the expression take the same value as 500 
– (250 – 100). This sequence of operations is 500 – 250+100. Thus,
500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 250 + 100.
Check that 500 – (250 – 100) is not equal to 500 – 250 – 100.
Notice again that when the brackets preceded by a negative sign 
are removed,  the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. In this 
case, the signs of 250 and – 100 change to – 250 and 100.
Example 14: Hira has a rare coin collection. She has 28 coins in one bag 
and 35 coins in another. She gifts her friend 10 coins from the second 
bag. Write an expression for the number of coins left with Hira.
This can be expressed by 28 + (35 – 10). 
We know that this is the same as 28 + (35 + (–10)). Since the terms 
can be added in any order, this expression can simply be written as 
28 + 35 + (–10), or 28 + 35 – 10. Thus, 
28 + (35 – 10) = 28 + 35 – 10 = 53.
When the brackets are NOT preceded by a negative sign, the terms 
within them do not change their signs upon removing the brackets. 
Notice the sign of the terms 35 and – 10 in the above expression.
Rather than simply remembering rules for when to change the sign and 
when not to, you can figure it out for yourself by thinking about the 
meanings of the expressions.

Removing Brackets — II
Example 15: Lhamo and Norbu went to a hotel. Each of them ordered 
a vegetable cutlet and a rasgulla. A vegetable cutlet costs ₹43 and a 
rasgulla costs ₹24. Write an expression for the amount they will have 
to pay.
As each of them had one vegetable cutlet and one rasagulla, each of 
their shares can be represented by 43 + 24.
What about the total amount they have to pay? Can it be described by 
the expression: 2 × 43 + 24?

Arithmetic Expressions
Writing it as sum of terms gives:
2 × 43 
+
This expression means 24 more than 
2 × 43. But, we want an expression 
which means twice or double of 43 + 24.
We can make use of brackets to write 
such an expression: 
2 × (43 + 24).
So, we can say that together they have 
to pay 2 × (43 + 24). This is also the same 
as paying for two vegetable cutlets and 
two rasgullas: 
2 × 43 + 2 × 24.
Therefore, 
2 × (43 + 24) = 2 × 43 + 2 × 24.
If another friend, Sangmu, joins them and orders the same items, what 
will be the expression for the total amount to be paid?
Example 16: In the Republic Day parade, there are boy scouts and girl 
guides marching together. The scouts march in 4 rows with 5 scouts in 
each row. The guides march in 3 rows with 5 guides in each row (see 
the figure below). How many scouts and guides are marching in this 
parade?
The number of boy scouts marching is 4 × 5. The number of girl 
guides marching is 3 × 5.
The total number of 
scouts and guides will be 
4 × 5 + 3 × 5.
This can also be found 
by first finding the total 
number of rows, i.e., 4 + 
3, and then multiplying 
their sum by the number 
of children in each row. 
Thus, the number of boys 
and girls can be found by 
(4 + 3) × 5. 
Therefore, 4 × 5 + 3 × 5 
= (4 + 3) × 5.
Computing these expressions, we get

(4 + 3) × 5 = 7 × 5 = 35
5 × 4 + 3 ≠ 5 × (4 + 3).  Can you explain why?
Is 5 × (4 + 3) = 5 × (3 + 4) = (3 + 4) × 5?
The observations that we have made in the previous two examples 
can be seen in a general way as follows. 
Consider 10 × 98 + 3 × 98. This means taking the sum of 10 times 98 
and 3 times 98.
98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98  +  98 + 98 + 98 
10 times
3 times
Clearly, this is the same as 10 + 3 = 13 times 98. Thus, 
10 × 98 +3 × 98 = (10 + 3) × 98.
Writing this equality the other way, we get
(10 + 3) 98 = 10 × 98 + 3 × 98.
Swapping the numbers in the products above, this property can be 
seen in the following form:
98 × 10 + 9 × 83 = 98 (10 + 3), and
98 (10 + 3) = 98 × 10 + 98 × 3.
Similarly, let us consider the expression 14 × 10 – 6 × 10. This means 
subtracting 6 times 10 from 14 times 10.
10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10
14 times
Clearly, this is 14 – 6 = 8 times 10. Thus,
14 × 10 – 6 × 10 =  (14 – 6) × 10, 
or
(14 – 6) × 10 = 14 × 10 – 6 × 10
This property can be nicely summed up as follows:
The multiple of a sum (difference) is the same as the sum (difference) 
of the multiples.
Tinker the Terms II
Let us understand what happens when we change the numbers 
occurring in a product.
Arithmetic Expressions
Example 17: Given 53 × 18 = 954. Find out 63 × 18.
As 63 × 18 means 63 times 18,
63 × 18	 = (53 + 10) × 18 
	
	
= 53 ×18 + 10×18
	
	
= 954 + 180
	
	
= 1134.
Example 18: Find an effective way of evaluating 97 × 25.
97 × 25 means 97 times 25.
We can write it as (100 – 3) × 25
We know that this is the same as the difference of 100 times 25 and 
3 times 25:
97 × 25 = 100 × 25 – 3 × 25
Find this value.
Use this method to find the following products: 
(a)	 95 × 8
(b)	 104 × 15
(c)	 49 × 50

•	 We have been reading and evaluating simple expressions for quite 
some time now. Here we started by revising the meaning of some 
simple expressions and their values.
•	 We learnt how to compare certain expressions through reasoning 
instead of bluntly evaluating them.
•	 To help read and evaluate complex expressions without confusion, 
we use terms and brackets.
•	 When an expression is written as a sum of terms, changing the order 
of the terms or grouping the terms does not change the value of the 
expression. This is because the “commutative property of addition” 
and the “associative property of addition”, respectively.
•	 To evaluate expressions within brackets, we saw that when we 
remove brackets preceded by a negative sign, the terms within the 
bracket change their sign.
•	 We also learnt about the “distributive property” — multiplying a 
number with an expression inside brackets is equal to the multiplying 
the number with each term in the bracket.
SUMMARY
Arithmetic Expressions
 
Expression Engineer!
Using three 3’s along with the four operations (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division) and brackets as needed we can create 
several expressions. For example, (3 + 3)/3 = 2, 3 + 3 – 3 = 3, 3 × 
3 + 3 = 12, and so on.
Using four 4’s, create expressions to get all values from 1 to 20.
Using the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once in any order get 
as many values as possible between  – 10 and +10.
Using the numbers 0 to 9 exactly once in any order, make an 
expression with a value 100.
