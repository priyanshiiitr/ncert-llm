A TALE OF THREE 
INTERSECTING 
LINES
A triangle is the most basic closed shape. As we know, it consists of:
•	 	three corner points, that we call the vertex of the triangle, and 
•	 	three line segments or the sides of the triangle that join the pairs 
of vertices.
Triangles come in various shapes. Some of them are shown below.

Observe the symbol used to denote a triangle and how the triangles 
are named using their vertices. While naming a triangle, the vertices 
can come in any order.
The three sides meeting at the corners give rise to three angles that 
we call the angles of the triangle. For example, in ∆ABC, these angles 
are ∠CAB, ∠ABC, ∠BCA, which we simply denote as ∠A, ∠B and ∠C, 
respectively.
What happens when the three vertices lie on a straight line?
7.1 Equilateral Triangles
Among all the triangles, the equilateral triangles are the most symmetric 
ones. These are triangles in which all the sides are of equal lengths. Let 
us try constructing them.
Construct a triangle in which all the sides are of length 4 cm.
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
How did you construct this triangle and what tools did you use? Can 
this construction be done only using a marked ruler (and a pencil)?
Constructing this triangle using just a ruler is certainly possible. But 
this might require several trials. Say we draw the base — let us call it 
AB — of length 4 cm (see the figure below), and mark the third point C 
using a ruler such that AC = 4 cm. This may not lead to BC also having 
a length of 4 cm. If this happens, we will have to keep making attempts 
to mark C till we get BC to be 4 cm long.

How do we make this construction more efficient?
Recall solving a similar problem in the previous year using a compass 
(in the Chapter ‘Playing with Constructions’). We had to mark the top 
point of a ‘house’ which is 5 cm from two other points. The method we 
used to get that point can also be used here.
After constructing AB = 4 cm, we can do the following.
Step 1: Using a compass, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 4 cm 
from A, as shown in the figure. The point C is somewhere on this arc. 
How do we mark it?

7.2 Constructing a Triangle When its Sides are 
Given
How do we construct triangles that are not equilateral?
Construct a triangle of sidelength 4 cm, 5 cm and 6 cm.
As in the previous case, this triangle can also be constructed using 
just a marked ruler. But it will involve several trials.
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
How do we construct this triangle more efficiently?
Choose one of the given lengths to be the base of the triangle: say 4 
cm. Draw the base. Let A and B be the base vertices, and call the third 
vertex C. Let AC = 5 cm and BC = 6 cm.
Fig. 7.1
Like we did in the case of equilateral triangles, let us first get all the 
points that are at a 5 cm distance from A. These points lie on the circle 
whose centre is A and has radius 5 cm. The point C must lie somewhere 
on this circle. How do we find it?

The required point C is one of the points of intersection of the two 
circles.
The reason why the point of 
intersection is the third vertex is the 
same as for equilateral triangles. This 
point lies on both the circles. Hence 
its distance from A is the radius of 
the circle centred at A (5 cm) and its 
distance from B is the same as the 
radius of the circle centred at B (6 cm).
Let us summarise the steps of 
construction, noting that constructing 
full circles is not necessary to get the 
third vertex (see Fig. 7.2 and 7.3).
Step 1: Construct the base AB with one of the side lengths. Let us choose 
AB = 4 cm (see Fig. 7.1).
Step 2: From A, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 5 cm 
(see Fig. 7.2).
Step 3: From B, construct an arc of radius 6 cm such that it intersects 
the first arc (see Fig. 7.3).
Step 4: The point where both the arcs meet is the required third 
vertex C. Join AC and BC to get ∆ABC.
Construct
Construct triangles having the following sidelengths (all the units are 
in cm):

(d)	 	4, 6, 8

We have seen that triangles having all three equal sides are called 
equilateral triangles. Those having two equal sides are called isosceles 
triangles.

Are Triangles Possible for any Lengths?
Can one construct triangles having any given sidelengths? Are there 
lengths for which it is impossible to construct a triangle? Let us explore 
this.
Construct a triangle with sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm.
What is happening? Are you able to construct the triangle?
Here is another set of lengths: 2 cm, 3 cm, and 6 cm. Check if a triangle 
is possible for these sidelengths.
Try to find more sets of lengths for which a triangle construction 
is impossible. See if you can find any pattern in them.
We see that a triangle is possible for some sets of lengths and 
not possible for others. How do we check if a triangle exists for a given 
set of lengths? One way is to actually try to construct the triangle and 
check if it is possible. Is there a more efficient way to check this?
Triangle Inequality
Consider the lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm. Does there exist a triangle 
having these as sidelengths?
To tackle this question, let us study a property of triangles. Imagine 
a small plot of plain land having a tent, a tree, and a pole. Imagine 
you are at the entrance of the tent and want to go to the tree. Which is 
the shorter path: (i) the straight-line path to the tree (the red path) or 
(ii) the straight-line path from the tent to the pole, followed by the 
straight-line path from the pole to the tree (the yellow path)?
Math 
Talk
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Clearly, the direct straight-line path from the tent to the tree is shorter 
than the roundabout path via the pole. In fact, the direct straight-line 
path is the shortest possible path to the tree from the tent.
Will the direct path between any two points be shorter than the 
roundabout path via a third point? Clearly, the answer is yes. 
Can this understanding be used to tell something about the existence 
of a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm?
Let us suppose that there is a triangle for this set of lengths. Remember 
that at this point we are not sure about the existence of the triangle but 
we are only supposing that it exists. Let us draw a rough diagram.
Fig. 7.4
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
Does everything look right with this triangle?
If this triangle were possible, then the direct path between any two 
vertices should be shorter than the roundabout path via the third 
vertex. Is this true for our rough diagram?
Let us consider the paths between B and C.
Direct path length = BC = 10 cm
What is the length of the roundabout path via the vertex A? It is the 
sum of the lengths of line segments BA and AC.
Roundabout path length = BA + AC = 15 cm + 30 cm = 45 cm
Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes.
Let us now consider the paths between A and B.
Direct path length = AB = 15 cm
Finding the length of the roundabout path via the vertex C, we get 
Roundabout path length = AC + CB = 30 cm + 10 cm = 40 cm
Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes.
Finally, consider paths between C and A.
Direct path length = CA = 30 cm
Roundabout path length = CB + BA = 10 cm + 15 cm = 25 cm
Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? In 
this case, the direct path is longer, which is absurd. Can such a triangle 
exist? No.
Therefore, a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm 
cannot exist.
We are thus able to see without construction why a triangle for the 
set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm cannot exist. We have been able 
to figure this out through spatial intuition and reasoning. 
Recall how we used similar intuition and reasoning to discover 
properties of intersecting and parallel lines. We will continue to do 
this as we explore geometry.
Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle having sidelengths 
3 cm, 3 cm and 7 cm? Verify your answer by construction.
“In the rough diagram in Fig. 7.4, is it possible to assign 
lengths in a different order such that the direct paths are 
always coming out to be shorter than the roundabout 
paths? If this is possible, then a triangle might exist.”
Is such rearrangement of lengths possible in the triangle?

Figure it Out
1.	 We checked by construction that there are no triangles having 
sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm and 8 cm; and 2 cm, 3 cm and 6 cm. Check if 
you could have found this without trying to construct the triangle.
2.	 Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle for each of 
the following sets of lengths?
(a)	 	10 km, 10 km and 25 km
(b)	 	5 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm
(c)	 	12 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm
You would have realised that using a rough figure and comparing 
the direct path lengths with their corresponding roundabout path 
lengths is the same as comparing each length with the sum of the other 
two lengths. There are three such comparisons to be made.
3.	 For  each set of lengths seen so far, you might have noticed that 
	
in at least two of the comparisons, the direct length was less 
than the sum of the other two (if not, check again!). For example, 
for the set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm, there are two 
comparisons where this happens:
10 < 15 + 30
15 < 10 + 30
But this doesn’t happen for the third length: 30 > 10 + 15.
Will this always happen? That is, for any set of lengths, will there be at 
least two comparisons where the direct length is less than the sum of 
the other two? Explore for different sets of lengths.
Further, for a given set of lengths, is it possible to identify which 
lengths will immediately be less than the sum of the other two, without 
calculations? 
[Hint: Consider the direct lengths in the increasing order.]
Given three sidelengths, what do we need to compare to check for the 
existence of a triangle?
When each length is smaller than the sum of the other two, we say 
that the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. For example, the set 3, 
4, 5 satisfies the triangle inequality whereas, the set 10, 15, 30 does not 
satisfy the triangle inequality.
We have seen that lengths such as 10, 15, 30 that do not satisfy the 
triangle inequality cannot be the sidelengths of a triangle.
Try
This
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
Does a triangle exist with sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm?
This satisfies the triangle inequality:
8 < 4 + 5 = 9
Why do we not need to check the other two sides?
This means that all the direct path lengths are less than the 
roundabout path lengths. Does this confirm the existence of a triangle? 
If one of the direct path lengths had been longer, we could have 
concluded that a triangle would surely not exist. But in this case, we 
can only say that a triangle may or may not exist.
For the triangle to exist, the arcs that we construct to get the third 
vertex must intersect. Is it possible to determine that this will happen 
without actually carrying out the construction?
Visualising the construction of circles
Let us imagine that we start the construction by constructing the 
longest side as the base. Let AB be the base of length 8 cm. The next 
step is the construction of sufficiently long arcs corresponding to the 
other two lengths: 4 cm and 5 cm.
Instead of just constructing the arcs, let us complete the full circles. 
Suppose, we construct a circle of radius 4 cm with A as the centre.
Now, suppose that a circle of radius 5 cm is constructed, centred at B. 
Can you draw a rough diagram of the resulting figure?
Note that in the figure below, AX = 4 cm and AB = 8 cm. So, what is 
BX? Does this length help in visualising the resulting figure?
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Since BX = 4 cm, and the radius of the circle centred at B is 5 cm, it is 
clear that the circles will intersect each other at two points.
Fig. 7.5: Circles intersecting each other at two points
What does this tell us about the existence of a triangle? The points 
A and B along with either of the points of intersection of the circles 
will give us the required triangle. Thus, there exists a triangle having 
sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm.
Figure it Out
1.	 Which of the following lengths can be the sidelengths of a triangle? 
Explain your answers. Note that for each set, the three lengths have 
the same unit of measure. 
(a)	 2, 2, 5	
(b)	 3, 4, 6
(c)	 2, 4, 8

(e)	 10, 20, 25	
(f)	
10, 20, 35

We observe from the previous problems that whenever there is 
a set of lengths satisfying the triangle inequality (each length < 
sum of the other two lengths), there is a triangle with those three 
lengths as sidelengths.
Will triangles always exist when a set of lengths satisfies the triangle 
inequality? How can we be sure?
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
We can be sure of the existence of a triangle only if we can show that 
the circles intersect internally (as in Fig. 7.5) whenever the triangle 
inequality is satisfied. But are there other possibilities when the two 
circles are constructed? Let us visualise and study them.
The following different cases can be conceived:
A
B
Case 1: Circles touch each other
A
B
Case 2: Circles do not intersect
A
B
Case 3: Circles intersect each other internally
Note that while constructing the circles, we take
(a)	
the length of the base AB = longest of the given length
(b)	 the radii of the circles to be the smaller two lengths.
Which of the above-mentioned cases will lead to the formation of a 
triangle? Clearly, triangles are formed only when the circles intersect 
each other internally (Case 3).
Let us study each of these cases by finding the relation between the 
radii (the smaller two lengths) and AB (longest length).
Case 1: Circles touch each other at a point
For this case to happen,
sum of the two radii = AB
or 
sum of the two smaller lengths = longest length

AB is composed of one radius and a part of the other. So, 
sum of the two radii > AB,
or 
sum of the two smaller lengths > longest length
Can we use this analysis to tell if a triangle exists when the lengths 
satisfy the triangle inequality?
If the given lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, then the sum of 
the two smaller lengths is greater than the longest length. This means 
that this will lead to Case 3 where the circles intersect internally, and 
so a triangle exists.
How will the two circles turn out for a set of lengths that do not satisfy 
the triangle inequality? Find 3 examples of sets of lengths for which 
the circles: 
(a)	
touch each other at a point,
(b)	 do not intersect.
Frame a complete procedure that can be used to check the existence of 
a triangle.

If a given set of three lengths satisfies the triangle inequality, then a 
triangle exists having those as sidelengths. If the set does not satisfy the 
triangle inequality, then a triangle with those sidelengths does not exist.

7.3 Construction of Triangles When Some Sides 
and Angles are Given
We have seen how to construct triangles when their sidelengths are 
given. Now, we will take up constructions where in place of some 
sidelengths, angle measures are given.

Do triangles always exist?
Do triangles exist for every combination of two angles and their

As in the case when we are given all three sides, it turns out that 
there is not always a triangle for every combination of two angles and 
the included side.
Find examples of measurements of two angles with the included side 
where a triangle is not possible.
Let us try to visualise such a situation. Once the base is drawn, try to 
imagine how the other sides should be so that they do not meet.
Here are some obvious examples.
If the two angles are greater than or equal to a right angle (90°), then 
it is clear that a triangle is not possible. 
Now we make one of the base angles an acute angle, say 40°. What 
are the possible values that the other angle should take so that the lines 
don’t meet?

Visually, it is clear that the line that creates the smallest ∠B has to be 
the one parallel to l. Let us call this parallel line m. 
Can you tell the actual value of ∠B be in this case? 
[Hint: Note that AB is the transversal.]
We have seen that when two lines are parallel, the internal angles 
on the same side of the transversal add up to 180°. So ∠B = 140°.
So, for what values of ∠B, does a triangle not exist? Does the length 
AB play any part here?
From the discussion above, it can be seen that the length AB does not 
play any part in deciding the existence of a triangle. We can say that a 
triangle does not exist when ∠B is greater than or equal to 140°.

Like the triangle inequality, can you form a rule that describes the two 
angles for which a triangle is possible?
Can the sum of the two angles be used for framing this rule?
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
When the sum of two given angles is less than 180°, a triangle exists 
with these angles. If the sum is greater than or equal to 180°, there is 
no triangle with these angles.
Let us take two angles, say 60° and 70°, whose sum is less than 180°. 
Let the included side be 5 cm.
What could the measure of the third angle be? Does this measure 
change if the base length is changed to some other value, say 7 cm? 
Construct and find out.
In general, once the two angles are fixed, does the third angle depend 
on the included sidelength? Try with different pairs of angles and 
lengths.
The measurements might show that the sidelength has no effect (or 
a very small effect) on the third angle. With this observation, let us see 
if we can find the third angle without carrying out the construction 
and measurement.
Try experimenting with different triangles to see if there is a 
relation between any two angles and the third one. To find this 
relation, what data will you keep track of and how will you 
organise the data you collect?
Consider a triangle ABC with ∠B= 50° and ∠C= 70°. Let us see how we 
can find ∠A without construction.

We saw that the notion of parallel lines was useful to determine that 
the sum of any two angles of a triangle is 
less than 180°. Parallel lines can be used to 
find the third angle, ∠BAC as well.
Let us suppose we construct a line XY 
parallel to BC through vertex A.
We can see new angles being formed here: 
∠XAB, and ∠YAC. What are their values?
Since the line XY is parallel to BC, 
∠XAB = ∠B and ∠YAC = ∠C, because they are alternate angles of the 
transversals AB and AC.

Therefore, ∠XAB = 50°, and ∠YAC = 70°. Can we find ∠BAC from this?
We know that ∠XAB, ∠YAC and ∠BAC together form 180°. So
∠XAB + ∠YAC + ∠BAC = 180°
50° + ∠BAC + 70° = 180°
120° + ∠BAC = 180°
Thus, ∠BAC = 60°
Now construct a triangle (taking BC to be of any suitable length) and

Take some time to reflect upon how we figured out the angle sum 
property. In the beginning, the relationship between the third angle 
and the other two angles was not at all clear. However, a simple idea of 
drawing a line parallel to the base through the top vertex (as in Fig.  7.7) 
suddenly made the relationship obvious. This ingenious idea can be 
found in a very influential book in the history of mathematics called 
‘The Elements’. This book is attributed to the Greek mathematician 
Euclid, who lived around 300 BCE.
This solution is yet another example of how creative thinking plays 
a key role in mathematics!
There is a convenient way of verifying the angle sum property by 
folding a triangular cut-out of a paper. Do you see how this shows that 
the sum of the angles in this triangle is 180°?

Exterior Angles
The angle formed between the extension of a side of a triangle and 
the other side is called an exterior angle of the triangle. In this figure, 
∠ACD is an exterior angle.

Exterior Angle
Find ∠ACD, if ∠A = 50°, and ∠B = 60°.
From the angle sum property, we know that 
50° + 60° + ∠ACB = 180°
110° + ∠ACB = 180°
So, ∠ACB = 70°
So, ∠ACD = 180 ° – 70° = 110°, 
since, ∠ACB and ∠ACD together form a straight angle. 
Find the exterior angle for different measures of ∠A and ∠B. Do you 
see any relation between the exterior angle and these two angles?
[Hint: From angle sum property, we have ∠A + ∠B + ∠ACB = 180°.]
We also have ∠ACD + ∠ACB = 180°, since they form a straight angle. 
What does this show?
7.4 Constructions Related to Altitudes of Triangles
There is another set of useful measurements with respect to a triangle —  
the height of each of its vertices with respect to the opposite sides.
In the world around us, we talk of the 
heights of various objects: the height of a 
person, the height of a tree, the height of 
a building, etc. What do we mean by the 
word ‘height’?
Consider a triangle ABC. What is the 
height of the vertex A from its opposite 
side BC, and how can it be measured?
Let AD be the line segment from A drawn perpendicular to BC. The 
length of AD is the height of the vertex A from BC. The line segment AD 
is said to be one of the ‘altitudes’ of the triangle. The other altitudes

are BE and CF in the figure below: the perpendiculars drawn from the 
other vertices to their respective opposite sides.

Whenever we use the word height of the triangle, we generally 
refer to the length of the altitude to whatever side we take as base (this 
altitude is AD in the case of Fig. 7.8).
What would the altitude from A to BC be in this triangle?

We extend BC and then drop the perpendicular from A to this line.
Altitudes Using Paper Folding
Cut out a paper triangle. Fix one of the sides as the base. Fold it in 
such a way that the resulting crease is an altitude from the top vertex 
to the base. Justify why the crease formed should be perpendicular to 
the base.
Construction of the Altitudes of a Triangle
Construct an arbitrary triangle. Label the vertices A, B, C taking BC to 
be the base. 
Construct the altitude from A to BC, 
Constructing the altitude using just a ruler is not accurate. To get a 
more precise angle of 90°, we use a set square along with a ruler.
Can you see how to do this?
A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines
Step 1: Keep the ruler aligned to the base. Place the set square on the 
ruler as shown, such that one of the edges of the right angle touches 
the ruler.

C
Step 2: Slide the set square along the ruler till the vertical edge of the 
set square touches the vertex A.

A
Step 3: Draw the altitude to BC through A using the vertical edge of the 
set square.
Does there exist a triangle in which a side is also an altitude?
Visualise such a triangle and draw a rough diagram.
We see that this happens in triangles where one of the angles is a 
right angle. 
Triangles having one right angle are called right-angled triangles 
or simply right triangles.

7.5 Types of Triangles
In our study of triangles, we have encountered the following types of 
triangles; equilateral, isosceles, scalene and right-angled triangles. 
Did you spot any other type of triangle?
The classification of triangles as equilateral and isosceles was based 
on equality of sides. 
Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles 
have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three 
different lengths. 
Can a similar classification be done based on equality of angles? Is 
there any relation between these two classifications? We will answer 
these questions in a later chapter.
We used angle measures when classifying a triangle as a right-
angled triangle. 
What are the other types of triangles based on angle measures?
A classification of triangles based on their angle measures is acute-
angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles. We have already 
seen what a right-angled triangle is. It is a triangle with one right angle. 
Similarly, an obtuse-angled triangle has one obtuse angle. 
What could an acute-angled triangle be? Can we define it as a  
triangle with one acute angle? Why not? 
In an acute-angled triangle, all three angles are acute angles.
Figure it Out
1.	 	Construct a triangle ABC with BC = 5 cm, AB = 6 cm, CA = 5 cm. 
Construct an altitude from A to BC.
2.	 	Construct a triangle TRY with RY = 4 cm, TR = 7 cm, ∠R = 140°. 
Construct an altitude from T to RY.

3.	 Construct a right-angled triangle ∆ABC with ∠B = 90°, 
AC = 5 cm. How many different triangles exist with these 
measurements?
	
[Hint: Note that the other measurements can take any values. Take 
AC as the base. What values can ∠A and ∠C take so that the other 
angle is 90°?]
4.	 Through construction, explore if it is possible to construct an 
equilateral triangle that is (i) right-angled (ii) obtuse-angled. 
Also construct an isosceles triangle that is (i) right-angled 
(ii) obtuse-angled.
•	 Use of a compass simplifies the construction of triangles when the 
sidelengths are given.
•	 A set of three lengths where the length of each is smaller than the 
sum of the other two is said to satisfy the triangle inequality.
•	 Sidelengths of a triangle satisfy triangle inequality, and, if a given set 
of lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, a triangle can be constructed 
with those sidelengths.
•	 Triangles can be constructed when the following measurements are 
given:
(a)	
two of the sides and their included angle
(b)	 two angles and the included side
•	 The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180°.
•	 An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a 
vertex to its opposite side.
•	 Equilateral triangles have sides of equal length. Isosceles triangles 
have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three 
different lengths. 
•	 Triangles are classified based on their angle measures as 
acute-angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles.

Shortest Path in a Box!
There is a spider in a corner of a box. It wants to reach the farthest 
opposite corner (marked in the figure). Since it 
cannot fly, it can reach the opposite point only by 
walking on the surfaces of the box. What is the 
shortest path it can take? 
Take a cardboard box and mark the path that 
you think is the shortest from one corner to its 
opposite corner. Compare the length of this path with that of the 
paths made by your friends.
