3.1 The Need for Smaller Units
Sonu’s mother was fixing a 
toy. She was trying to join 
two pieces with the help of 
a 
screw. 
Sonu 
was 
watching his mother with 
great curiosity. His mother 
was unable to join the 
pieces. Sonu asked why. 
His mother said that the 
screw was not of the 
right size.
She brought another screw from the box and was able to fix the toy. 
The two screws looked the same to Sonu. But when he observed them 
closely, he saw they were of slightly different lengths.
Sonu was fascinated 
by how such a small 
difference in lengths 
could matter so much. 
He was curious to 
know the difference 
in lengths. He was also 
curious to know how 
little 
the 
difference 
was 
because 
the 
screws looked nearly 
the same.
In the following figure, screws are placed above a scale. Measure 
them and write their length in the space provided.
A PEEK BEYOND 
THE POINT
A Peek Beyond the Point
Which scale helped you measure the length of the screws accurately? 
Why? 
What is the meaning of 2 7
10  cm (the length of the first screw)?
As seen on the ruler, the unit length between two consecutive 
numbers is divided into 10 equal parts. To get the length 2 7
10 cm, we 
go from 0 to 2 and then take seven parts of 1
10. The length of the screw 
is 2 cm and 7
10 cm. Similarly, we can make sense of the length 3 2
10 cm.
We read 2 7
10 cm as two and seven-tenth centimeters, and 3 2
10 cm 
as three and two-tenth centimeters.
Can you explain why the unit was divided into smaller parts to measure 
the screws?
Measure the following objects using a scale and write their 
measurements in centimeters (as shown earlier for the lengths of the 
screws): pen, sharpener, and any other object of your choice.
Write the measurements of the objects shown in the picture:

As seen here, when exact measures are required we can make use of 
smaller units of measurement.
3.2 A Tenth Part
The length of the pencil shown in the figure below is 3 4
10 units, which can 
also be read as 3 units and four one-tenths, i.e., (3 × 1) + (4 × 1
10) units.
= 10 times 1
10 = 10 × 1
10 = 1 unit 
This length is the same as 34 one-tenths units because 10 one-tenths 
units make one unit.

Sonu is measuring some of his body parts. The length of Sonu’s lower 
arm is 2 7
10 units, and that of his upper arm is 3 6
10 units. What is the 
total length of his arm?
To get the total length, let us see the lower and upper arm length as 
2 units and 7 one-tenths, and 3 units and 6 one-tenths, respectively.
So, there are (2 + 3) units and (7 + 6) one-tenths. Together, they make 
5 units and 13 one-tenths. But 13 one-tenths is 1 unit and 3 one-tenths. 
So, the total length is 6 units and 3 one-tenths.

= 6 + 3
	
	
	
	
= 6 3

Or, both the lengths can be converted to tenths and then added:

done in different ways. For example,

Now, the number has 11 units and 14 one-tenths. We subtract 7 one-
tenths from 14 one-tenths and then subtract 6 units from 11 units.

3.3 A Hundredth Part

length now?

We can say that its 
length is between 4 4
10 
units and 4 5
10 units. But 
we cannot state its exact 
measurement, since there 
are no markings. Earlier, 
we split a unit into 10 
one-tenths 
to 
measure 
smaller lengths. We can 
do something similar and 
split each one-tenth into 
10 parts.
What is the length of this 
smaller part? How many 
such smaller  parts make 
a unit length?
As shown in the figure 
below, each one-tenth has 
10 smaller parts, and there are 10 one-tenths in a unit; therefore, there 
will be 100 smaller parts in a unit. Therefore, one part’s length will 
be 1
100 of a unit.
Returning to our question, what is the length of the folded paper? 
We can see that it ends at 4 4

3.4 Decimal Place Value
You may have noticed that whenever we need to measure something 
more accurately, we split a part into 10 (smaller) equal parts ― we split 
a unit into 10 one-tenths and then split each one-tenth into 10, one-
hundredths and then we use these smaller parts to measure.

Can we not split a unit into 4 equal parts, 5 equal parts, 8 equal parts, 
or any other number of equal parts instead?
Yes, we can. The example below 
compares how the same length is 
represented when the unit is split 
into 10 equal parts and when the 
unit is split into 4 equal parts.
If an even more precise measure 
is needed, each quarter can further 
be split into four equal parts. Each 
part then measures 1
16 of a unit, i.e., 
16 such parts make 1 unit.
Then why split a unit into 10 parts every time?
The reason is the special role that 10 plays in the Indian place value 
system. For a whole number written in the Indian place value system — 
for example, 281 — the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is 
tens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger 
than the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is 
10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left:
10 ones make 1 ten,
10 tens make 1 hundred,
10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on.

In order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities 
smaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts. What does 
this give? It gives one-tenth. Further dividing it into 10 parts gives 
one-hundredth, and so on.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Can we extend this further?
What will the fraction be when 1
100 is split into 10 equal parts?
It will be 
1000 , i.e., a thousand such parts make up a unit.
Just as when we extend to the left of 10,000, we get bigger place 
values at each step, we can also extend to the right of 
1000 , getting 
smaller place values at each step.

This way of writing numbers is called the “decimal system” since it 
is based on the number 10; “decem” means ten in Latin, which in turn 
is cognate to the Sanskrit daśha meaning 10, with similar words for 
10 occurring across many Indian languages including Odia, Konkani, 
Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Bodo, and Assamese. We shall learn 
about other ways of writing numbers in later grades.
How Big?
We already know that a hundred 10s make 1000, and a hundred 100s 
make 10000.
We can ask similar questions about fractional parts:
(a)	 	How many thousandths make one unit?
(b)	 	How many thousandths make one tenth?
(c)	 	How many thousandths make one hundredth?
(d)	 	How many tenths make one ten?
(e)	 	How many hundredths make one ten?
Make a few more questions of this kind and answer them.
Notation, Writing and Reading of Numbers
We have been writing numbers in a particular way, say 456, instead of 
writing them as 4 × 100 (4 hundreds) + 5 × 10 (5 tens) + 6 × 1 (6 ones). 
Similarly, can we skip writing tenths and hundredths?
Can the quantity 4 2
10 be written as 42 (skipping the 1
10 in 2 × 1
10) ? 
If yes, how would we know if 42 means 4 tens and 2 units or it 
means 4 units and 2 tenths?
Similarly, 705 could mean:
(a)	 	7 hundreds, and 0 tens and 5 ones (700 + 0 + 5)
(b)	 	7 tens and 0 units and 5 tenths (70 + 0 + 5

Since these are different quantities, we need to have distinct ways 
of writing them.
To identify the place value where integers end and the fractional 
parts start, we use a point or period (‘.’) as a separator, called a 
decimal point.
The above quantities in decimal notation are then:

Thus decimal notation is a natural extension of the Indian place 
value system to numbers also having fractional parts. Just as 705 means 
7 × 100 + 5 × 1, the number 70.5 means 7 × 10 + 5 × 1
10 , and 7.05 means 
7 × 1 +5 × 1
100. 
We have seen how to write numbers using the decimal point (‘.’). But 
how do we read/say these numbers?
We know that 705 is read as seven hundred and five.
70.5 is read as seventy point five, short for seventy and five-tenths.
7.05 is read as seven point zero five, short for seven and five 
hundredths.
0.274 is read as zero point two seven four. We don’t read it as zero 
point two hundred and seventy four as 0.274 means 2 one-tenths 
and 7 one-hundredths and 4 one-thousandths.
Make a place value table similar to the one above. Write each quantity 
in decimal form and in terms of place value, and read the number:
(a)	 	2 ones, 3 tenths and 5 hundredths
(b)	 	1 ten and 5 tenths

We have been using a scale to measure length for a few years. We 
already know that 1 cm = 10 mm (millimeters).
How many cm is 1 mm?
1 mm = 1
10 cm = 0.1 cm (i.e., one-tenth of a cm).
How many cm is (a) 5 mm? (b) 12 mm?
5 mm = 5
10 cm = 0.5 cm
12 mm = 10 mm + 2 mm 
 	
  = 1 cm + 2

Weight Conversion
Let us look at kilograms (kg). We know that 1 kg = 1000 gram (g). We 
can say that
1 g = 
1000 kg = 0.001 kg.
How many kilograms is 5 g?
5 g = 
1000 kg = 0.005 kg.
How many kilograms is 10 g?
10 g = 10
1000 kg = 1
100 kg = 0.010 kg.
As each gram is one-thousandth of a kg, 254 g can be written as
254 g = 254

Look at the picture below showing different quantities of rice. 
Starting from the 1g heap, subsequent heaps can be found that are 10 
times heavier than the previous heap/packets. The combined weight of 
rice in this picture is 11.111 kg.
Also, 
1 gram = 1000 milligrams (mg). So, 1 mg = 
1000 g = 0.001 g.
Rupee ─ Paise conversion  
You may have heard of ‘paisa’. 100 paise is equal to 1 rupee. As we have 
coins and notes for rupees, coins for paise were also used commonly 
until recently. There were coins for 1 paisa, 2 paise, 3 paise, 5 paise, 10 
paise, 20 paise, 25 paise, and 50 paise. All denominations of 25 paise 
and less were removed from use in the year 2011. But we still see paise 
in bills, account statements, etc.
1 rupee = 100 paise
1 paisa = 1

We start by comparing the most significant digits (digits with the 
highest place value) of the two numbers. If the digits are the same, 
we compare the next smaller place value. We keep going till we find 
a position where the digits are not equal. The number with the larger 
digit at this position is the greater of the two.
Why can we stop comparing at this point? Can we be sure that 
whatever digits are there after this will not affect our 
conclusion? 
Which decimal number is greater?

Closest Decimals
Consider the decimal numbers 0.9, 1.1, 1.01, and 1.11. Identify the 
decimal number that is closest to 1.
Let us compare the decimal numbers. Arranging these in ascending 
order, we get 0.9 < 1 < 1.01 < 1.1 < 1.11. Among the neighbours of 1, 1.01 
is 1/100 away from 1 whereas 0.9 is 10/100 away from 1. Therefore, 
1.01 is closest to 1.
Which of the above is closest to 1.09?
Which among these is closest to 4: 3.56, 3.65, 3.099?
Which among these is closest to 1: 0.8, 0.69, 1.08?

Estimating Sums and Differences
Sonu has observed sums and differences of decimal numbers and says, 
“If we add two decimal numbers, then the sum will always be greater 
than the sum of their whole number parts. Also, the sum will always be 
less than 2 more than the sum of their whole number parts.” 
Let us use an example to understand what his claim means: 
If the two numbers to be added are 25.936 and 8.202, the claim is 
that their sum will be greater than 25 + 8 (whole number parts) and 
will be less than 25 + 1 + 8 + 1.
What do you think about this claim? Verify if this is true for these 
numbers. Will it work for any 2 decimal numbers? 
What about for the sum of 25.93603259 and 8.202?
Similarly, come up with a way to narrow down the range of whole 
numbers within which the difference of two decimal numbers 
will lie. 
Note to the Teacher: Estimating the result before computing may help in 
identifying if a mistake happens with the calculation.

•	 In 2013, the finance office of Amsterdam City Council (Netherlands) 
mistakenly sent out €188 million in housing benefits instead of the 
intended €1.8 million due to a programming error that processed 
payments in euro cents instead of euros. (1 euro-cent = 1/100 
euro).
•	 In 1983, a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada 
Boeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300 
pounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1 
pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the 
pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield. 
Fortunately, everyone survived.
Several incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal 
numbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5 
mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed 
quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the 
location of the decimal point.
Deceptive Decimal Notation
Sarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post 
noon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.? 
None of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10 
equal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60 
minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach 
the station at 4:30.
Here is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width 
of an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a 
door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches 
(since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully.
I said the door’s 
width should be 
2.5 ft.
It is 2.5 ft! You 
can verify.

If you watch cricket, you might have noticed decimal-looking 
numbers like ‘Overs left: 5.5’. Does this mean 5 overs and 5 balls or 5 
overs and 3 balls? Here, 5.5 overs means 5 5

i.e., 5 overs and 5 balls.

A Pinch of History – Decimal Notation Over Time
Decimal fractions (i.e., fractions with denominators like 1
10 , 
100 , 
1000 , and so on) are used in the works of a number of ancient Indian 
astronomers and mathematicians, including in the important 8th 
century works of Śhrīdharāchārya on arithmetic and algebra. Decimal 
notation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in 
Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al Hindī (The Book of Chapters on Indian 
Arithmetic) by Abūl Ḥassan al-Uqlīdisī, an Arab mathematician, in 
around 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0ˈ 059375.
In the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional 
parts, a number of different notations were used:
•	 a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as 
shown above),
•	 use of different colours and
•	 a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal 
places (0.36 would be written as 36
).
In the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and 
Christopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period 
(‘.’) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while 
François Viète, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead. 
Currently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer 
part and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5 
is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal 
point has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers 
having fractional parts in the Indian place value system.
