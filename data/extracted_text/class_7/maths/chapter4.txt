4.1 The Notion of Letter-Numbers
In this chapter we shall look at a concise way of expressing mathematical 
relations and patterns. We shall see how this helps us in thinking about 
these relationships and patterns, and in explaining why they may hold 
true. 
Example 1: Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab. When Aftab’s age 
10 years, Shabnam’s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab’s age is 18 years, 
what will Shabnam’s age be? _______ 
Given Aftab’s age, how will you find out Shabnam’s age?
Easy: We add 3 to Aftab’s age to get Shabnam’s age.
Can we write this as an expression? 
Shabnam’s age is 3 years more than Aftab’s. In short, this can be 
written as:
Shabnam’s age = Aftab’s age + 3.
Such 
mathematical 
relations 
are 
generally represented in a shorthand 
form. In the relation above, instead 
of writing the phrase ‘Aftab’s Age’, 
the convention is to use a convenient 
symbol. Usually, letters or short phrases 
are used for this purpose.
Let us say we use the letter a to 
denote Aftab’s age (we could have 
used any other letter), and s to denote 
Shabnam’s age. Then the expression to 
find Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as
s = a + 3.
If a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age?

USING LETTER-
NUMBERS
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Replacing a by 23 in the expression a + 3, we get, s = 23 + 3 = 26 years.
Letters such as a and s that are used to represent numbers are called 
letter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers, 
such as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions.
Given the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab’s age.
We know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab’s 
age will be 3 less than Shabnam’s. This can be described as
	
	
Aftab’s age = Shabnam’s age – 3.
If we again use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age and the letter s 
to denote Shabnam’s age, then the algebraic expression would be: 
a = s – 3, meaning 3 less than s.
Use this expression to find Aftab’s age if Shabnam’s age is 20.
Example 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns. He repeatedly 
places Ls next to each other. Each L has two matchsticks as shown in 
Figure 4.2.
Fig. 4.2
How many matchsticks are needed to make 5 Ls? It will be 5 × 2.
How many matchsticks are needed to make 7 Ls? It will be 7 × 2.
How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 × 2.
Now, what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number 
of sticks?
First, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L 
needs 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2 
times the number of L’s. This can be written as:
Number of matchsticks = 2 × Number of L’s
Now, we can use any letter to denote the number of L’s. Let’s use n. 
The algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be:
2 × n.
This expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make 
n L’s. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the 
number of L.
Example 3: Ketaki prepares and supplies coconut-jaggery laddus. The 
price of a coconut is ₹35 and the price of 1 kg jaggery is ₹60.
Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
How much should she pay if she buys 10 coconuts and 5 kg jaggery?
Cost of 10 coconuts = 10 × ₹35
Cost of 5 kg jaggery = 5 × ₹60
Total cost = 10 × ₹35 + 5 × ₹60 = ₹350 + ₹300 = ₹650.
How much should she pay if she buys 8 coconuts and 9 kg jaggery?
Write an algebraic expression to find the total amount to be paid for a 
given number of coconuts and quantity of jaggery.
Let us identify the relationships and then write the expressions.
Quantity needed
Relationship
Expression
Cost of coconuts 
Number of 
coconuts × 35
c × 35
Cost of jaggery 
Number of kgs of 
jaggery × 60
j × 60
Here, ‘c’ represents the number of coconuts and ‘j’ represents the 
number of kgs of jaggery. The total amount to be paid will be: 
Cost of coconuts + Cost of jaggery.
The corresponding algebraic expression can be written as:
c × 35 + j × 60
Use this expression (or formula) to find the total amount to be paid for 
7 coconuts and 4 kg jaggery.
Notice that for different values of ‘c’ and ‘j’, the value of the expression 
also changes.
Writing this expression as a sum of terms we get: 
+
c × 35
j × 60
Example 4: We are familiar with calculating the perimeters of simple 
shapes. Write expressions for perimeters.
The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of its side. This can 
be written as the expression: 4 × q, where q stands for the sidelength.
What is the perimeter of a square with sidelength 7 cm? Use the 
expression to find out.
You must have realised how the use of letter-numbers and algebraic 
expressions allows us to express general mathematical relations in

a concise way. Mathematical relations expressed this way are often 
called formulas.

4.2 Revisiting Arithmetic Expressions
We learnt to write expressions as sums of terms and it became easy 
for us to read arithmetic expressions. Many times they could have 
been read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping 
(adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers 
by grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating 
expressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of 
the expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including 
brackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive 
property (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples).
Let us revise these concepts and find the values of the following 
expressions:
1.	
23 – 10 × 2	
2. 	
83 + 28 – 13 + 32
3.	
34 – 14 + 20	
4. 	
42 + 15 – (8 – 7)
5.	
68 – (18 + 13)	
6. 	
7 × 4 + 9 × 6
7.	
20 + 8 × (16 – 6)
Let us evaluate the first expression, 23 – 10 × 2. First we shall write 
the terms of the expression. Notice that one of the terms is a number, 
while the other one has to be converted to a number before adding the 
two terms. 
23 – 10 × 2 = 23 + –10 × 2 = 23 + –20 = 3
w – 1
w
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Let us now evaluate the second one. All the terms of this expression 
are numbers. If we notice the terms, we find that it will be easier to 
evaluate if we swap and group the terms. 
83 + 28 – 13 + 32 = 
Let us now look at the fifth expression. It has brackets with a negative 
sign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways — by solving the bracket 
first (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets 
appropriately (as on the right side).
Now, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions. 
Algebraic expressions also take number values when the letter-
numbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for 
finding Shabnam’s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the 
letter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26.
4.3 Omission of the Multiplication Symbol in 
Algebraic Expressions
Look at this number sequence:
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...
How can we describe this sequence or pattern? Easy: These are the 
numbers appearing in the multiplication table of 4 (multiples of 4 in 
an increasing order).
What is the third term of this sequence? It is 4 × 3.
What is the 29th term of this sequence? It is 4 × 29.
Find an algebraic expression to get the nth term of this sequence.
Note that here ‘n’ is a letter-number that denotes a position in the 
sequence.

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
As it is the sequence of multiples of 4, it can be seen that the nth term 
will be 4 times n:
4 × n
As a standard practice, we shorten 4 × n to 4n by skipping the 
multiplication sign. We write the number first, followed by the letter(s).
Find the value of the expression 7k when k = 4. The value is 7 × 4 = 28.
Find the value that the expression 5m + 3 takes when m = 2.
As 5m stands for 5 × m, the value of the expression when m = 2 is
5 × 2 + 3 = 13.
Mind the Mistake, Mend the Mistake
Some simplifications are shown below where the letter-numbers are 
replaced by numbers and the value of the expression is obtained. 
1.	Observe each of them and identify if there is a mistake. 
2.	If you think there is a mistake, try to explain what might have gone 
wrong. 
3.	Then, correct it and give the value of the expression.
4.4 Simplification of Algebraic Expressions
Earlier we found expressions to find perimeters of different regular 
figures in terms of their sides. Let us now find an expression to find the 
perimeter of a rectangle. 
If a = – 4,
then 10 – a = 6.
If d = 6,
then 3d = 36.
If s = 7,
then 3s – 2 = 15.
If r = 8,
then 2r + 1 = 29.
If j = 5,
then 2j = 10.
If m = –6,
then 3 (m + 1) = 19.
If f = 3, g = 1
then 2f – 2g = 2.
If t = 4, b = 3
then 2t + b = 24.
If h = 5, n = 6
then h – (3 – n) = 4.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
As in the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter 
when the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known: 
Find the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth.
Let us use the letter-numbers l and b in place of length and breadth 
respectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have 
p = l + b + l + b
As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an 
expression can be added in any order. Hence the above expression can 
be written as:
= l + l + b + b
As l + l = 2 × l = 2l, and b + b = 2 × b = 2b, we have 
p = 2l + 2b.
Notice that the initial expression (l + b + l + b) and the final expression 
(2l + 2b) that we got for the perimeter look different. However, they 
are equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by 
applying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are 
equal in the sense that they both take the same values when letter-
numbers are replaced by numbers. 
For example, if we assign l = 3, b = 4, we get
l + b + l + b = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14, and
2l + 2b = 2 × 3 + 2 × 4 = 14.
We call the expression 2l + 2b the simplified form of l + b + l + b.
Let us see some more examples of simplification.
Example 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers 
sold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d. Find 
the total money earned by the shopkeeper during these three days.
Day 1
Day 2
Day 3
Pencils 
(Price ‘c’)
3
Erasers 
(Price ‘d’)
6
Let us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils.
The money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c. Similarly, the 
money earned by selling pencils on Day 2 is _____, and Day 3 is ______.
The total money earned by the sale of pencils is 5c + 3c + 10c. Can we 
simplify this expression further and reduce the number of terms?
Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
The expression means 5 times c is added to 3 times c is added to 10 
times c. So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This 
is what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus,
5 × c + 3 × c + 10 × c = (5 + 3 + 10) × c
(5 + 3 + 10) × c can be simplified to 18 × c = 18c. 
If c = ₹50, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils.
Write the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers. 
Then, simplify the expression.
The expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and 
erasers during these three days is 18c + 11d.
Can the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further?
There is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains 
different letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form.
In this problem, we saw the expression 5c + 3c + 10c getting simplified 
to the expression 18c. 
Check that both expressions take the same value when c is replaced by 
different numbers. 
Example 6: A big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as 
shown. Write an expression describing the area of the bigger rectangle.
The areas of the smaller rectangles are 4v sq. units and 3v sq. units. 
The area of the bigger rectangle can be found in two ways: (i) by 
directly using its side lengths v and (4 + 3), or (ii) by adding the areas 
of the smaller rectangles.
The first way gives 7v, and the second way gives 4v + 3v. We know 
that they are equal: 4v + 3v = 7v, and this is the required expression for 
the area of the bigger rectangle.
As earlier, a big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown 
below. Write an expression to find the area of the rectangle AEFD. 
Another way of seeing 
the distributive 
property.

v
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Even in this case, the area of rectangle AEFD can be found in two 
ways: (i) by directly using the side lengths n and (12 – 4), or (ii) 
subtracting the area of the rectangle EBCF from that of ABCD.
The first method gives us 8n, and the second method gives us 
12n – 4n, and they are equal, since 12n – 4n = 8n. This is the expression 
for the area of the rectangle AEFD.
Sets of terms such as (5c, c, 10c), (12n, – 4n) that involve the same 
letter-numbers are called like terms. Sets of terms such as {18c, 11d} 
are called unlike terms as they have different letter-numbers.
As we have seen, like terms can be added together and simplified 
into a single term.
Example 7: A shop rents out chairs 
and tables for a day’s use. To rent 
them, one has to first pay the following 
amount per piece.
When the furniture is returned, the 
shopkeeper pays back some amount 
as follows.
Write an expression for the total 
number of rupees paid if x chairs and 
y tables are rented.
For x chairs and y tables, let us find the total amount paid at the 
beginning and the amount one gets back after returning the furniture. 
Describe the procedure to get these amounts.
The total amount in rupees paid at the beginning is 40x + 75y, and 
the total amount returned is 6x + 10y.
So, the total amount paid = (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y). 
Can we simplify this expression? If yes, how? If not, why not?

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
Recalling how we open brackets in an arithmetic expression, we get
(40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) = (40x + 75y) – 6x – 10y
Since the terms can be added in any order, the remaining bracket 
can be opened and the expression becomes 40x + 75y + – 6x + – 10y
We can group the like terms together, This results in
40x + – 6x + 75y + – 10y
= (40 – 6)x + (75 – 10)y
= 34x + 65y.
The expression (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y) is simplified to 34x + 65y, 
which is the total amount paid in rupees.
Could we have written the initial expression as  
(40x + 75y) + (– 6x – 10y)?
Example 8: Charu has been through three rounds of a quiz. Her scores 
in the three rounds are 7p – 3q, 8p – 4q, and 6p – 2q. Here, p represents 
the score for a correct answer and q represents the penalty for an 
incorrect answer. 
What do each of the expressions mean? 
If the score for a correct answer is 4 (p = 4) and the penalty for a wrong 
answer is 1 (q = 1), find Charu’s score in the first round.
Charu’s score is 7 × 4 – 3 × 1. We can evaluate this expression by 
writing it as a sum of terms.
7 × 4 – 3 × 1 = 7 × 4 + – 3 × 1 = 28 + – 3 = 25 
What are her scores in the second and third rounds? 
What if there is no penalty? What will be the value of q in that 
situation? 
What is her final score after the three rounds? 
Her 
final 
score 
will 
be 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
three 
scores: 
(7p – 3q) + (8p – 4q) + (6p – 2q).
Since the terms can be added in any order, we can remove the 
brackets and write
7p + – 3q + 8p + – 4q + 6p + –2q
= 7p + 8p + 6p + – (3q) + – (4q) + – (2q)   (by swapping and grouping)
= (7 + 8 + 6)p + – (3 + 4 + 2)q
= 21p + – 9q 
= 21p – 9q.
Charu’s total score after three rounds is 21p – 9q. Her friend Krishita’s 
score after three rounds is 23p – 7q.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Give some possible scores for Krishita in the three rounds so that they 
add up to give 23p – 7q.
Can we say who scored more? Can you explain why?
How much more has Krishita scored than Charu? This can be found by 
finding the difference between the two scores.
23p – 7q – (21p – 9q)
Simplify this expression further.
Example 9: Simplify the expression 4 (x + y) – y
Using the distributive property, this expression can be simplified to
4 (x + y) – y = 4x + 4y – y
	
= 4x + 4y + – y 
	
= 4x + (4 – 1)y
	
= 4x + 3y.
Example 10: Are the expressions 5u and 5 + u equal to each other?
The expression 5u means 5 times the number u, and the expression 
5 + u means 5 more than the number u. These two being different 
operations, they should give different values for most values of u. 
Let us check this.
Fill the blanks below by replacing the letter-numbers by numbers; an 
example is shown. Then compare the values that 5u and 5 + u take.
If the expressions 5u and 5 + u are equal, then they should take the

same values for any given value of u. But we can see that they do not. 
So, these two expressions are not equal.
Are the expressions 10y – 3 and 10(y – 3) equal? 
10y – 3, short for 10 × y – 3, means 3 less than 10 times y,
10(y – 3), short for 10 × (y – 3), means 10 times (3 less than y).
Let us compare the values that these expressions take for different 
values of y.
 
After filling in the two diagrams, do you think the two expressions are 
equal?
Example 11: What is the sum of the numbers 
in the picture (unknown values are denoted by 
letter-numbers)?
 There are many ways to go about it. Here, we 
show some of them.
1.		
Adding row wise gives:
(4 × 3) + (r + s) + (r + s) + (4 × 3)
2.		
Adding like terms together gives:
(8 × 3) + (r + r) + (s + s)
3.		
Adding the upper half and doubling gives:
2 × (4 × 3 + r + s)
The three expressions might seem different. We can simplify each 
one and see that they all are the same: 2r + 2s + 24.

there any relation between the number of terms and the number of 
letter-numbers these expressions have?
4.5 Pick Patterns and Reveal Relationships
In the first section we got a glimpse of algebraic expressions and 
how to use them to describe simple patterns and relationships in a 
concise and elegant manner. Here, we continue to look for general 
relationships between quantities in different scenarios, find patterns 
and, interestingly, even explain why these patterns occur.
 Remember the importance of describing in simple language, or 
visualising mathematical  relationships, before trying to write them as 
expressions.
Formula Detective
Look at the picture given. In each case, the number machine takes in 
the 2 numbers at the top of the ‘Y’ as inputs, performs some operations 
and produces the result at the bottom. The machine performs the same 
operations on its inputs in each case.
Find out the formula of this number machine.
The formula for the number machine above is “two times the first 
number minus the second number”. When written as an algebraic 
expression, the formula is 2a – b. The expression for the first set of 
inputs is 2 × 5 – 2 = 8. Check that the formula holds true for each set 
of inputs.

Find the formulas of the number machines below and write the 
expression for each set of inputs.
Now, make a formula on your own. Write a few number machines as 
examples using that formula. Challenge your classmates to figure it out!
Note to the Teacher: Not just solving problems but creating new questions is 
also very much a part of learning and doing mathematics!

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
Let us start with design C. It appears for the first time at position 3, 
the second time at position 6. 
Where would design C appear for the nth time?
We can see that this design appears in positions that are multiples of 
3. So the nth occurrence of Design C will be at position 3n.
Similarly, find the formula that gives the position where the other 
Designs appear for the nth time.
The positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on.
We can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one 
less than the position at which Design C appears for the nth time. Thus, 
the nth occurrence of Design B is at position:
3n – 1
Similarly, the expression describing the position at which the design 
A appears for the nth time is: 3n – 2.
Given a position number can we find out the design that appears there? 
Which Design appears at Position 122?
If the position is a multiple of 3, then clearly we have Design C. As 
seen earlier, if the position is one less than a multiple of 3, it has Design 
B, and if it is 2 less than a multiple of 3, then it has Design A. 
Can the remainder obtained by dividing the position number by 3 be 
used for this? Observe the table below.
Position no.

Use this to find what design appears at positions 99, 122, and 148.
Patterns in a Calendar
Here is the calendar of November 2024. Consider 2 × 2 squares, 
as marked in the calendar. The numbers in this square show an 
interesting property.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Let us take the marked 2 × 2 square, and 
consider the numbers lying on the diagonals; 
12 and 20; 13 and 19. Find their sums; 12 + 20, 
13 + 19. What do you observe?
They are equal. 
Let us extend the numbers in the calendar beyond 
30, creating endless rows.
Will the diagonal sums be equal in every 2 × 2 square in this endless 
grid? How can we be sure? 
To be sure of this we cannot check with all 2 × 2 squares as there are 
an unlimited number of them.
Let us consider a 2 × 2 square. Its top left number can be any number. 
Let us call it ‘a’. 
Given that we know the top left number, how do we 
find the other numbers in this 2 × 2 square?
As we have been doing, first let us describe the other 
numbers in words. 
a

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
•	 the number to the right of ‘a’ will be 1 more than it.
•	 the number below ‘a’ will be 7 more than it.
•	 the number diagonal to ‘a’ will be 8 more than it.
So the other numbers in the 2 × 2 square can be 
represented as shown in the grid. Let us find the 
diagonal sums; a + (a + 8), and (a + 1) + (a + 7).
Let us simplify them.
Since the terms can be added in any order, the 
brackets can be opened.
a + (a + 8) = a + a + 8 = 2a + 8
(a + 1) + (a + 7) = a + 1 + a + 7 = a + a + 1 + 7 = 2a + 8
We see that both diagonal sums are equal to 2a + 8 (8 more than 
2 times a).
Verify this expression for diagonal sums by considering any 2 × 2 
square and taking its top left number to be ‘a’. 
Thus, we have shown that diagonal sums are equal for any value of 
a, i.e., for any 2 × 2 square!
 
Consider a set of numbers from the calendar (having endless rows) 
forming under the following shape:
Find the sum of all the numbers. Compare it with the number in the 
centre: 15. Repeat this for another set of numbers that forms this shape. 
What do you observe? 
We see that the total sum is always 5 times the number in the centre.
Will this always happen? How do you show this?
[Hint: Consider a general set of numbers that forms this shape. 
Take the number at the centre to be ‘a’. Express the other numbers in 
terms of ‘a’.]
Find other shapes for which the sum of the numbers within the 
figure is always a multiple of one of the numbers.
a
a + 1
a + 7
a + 8
This problem is an example that shows the power of algebraic modelling 
in verifying whether a pattern will always hold.

Matchstick Patterns
Look at the picture below. It is a pattern using matchsticks. Can you 
identify what the pattern is?
We can see that Step 1 has 1 triangle, Step 2 has 2 triangles, Step 3 
has 3 triangles, and so on.
Can you tell how many matchsticks there will be in the next step, 
Step 5? It is 11. You can also draw this and see.
How many matchsticks will there be in Step 33, Step 84, and Step 108? 
Of course, we can draw and count, but is there a quicker way to find 
the answers using the pattern present here?
What is the general rule to find the number of matchsticks in the 
next step? We can see that at each step 2 matchsticks are placed to get 
the next one, i.e., the number of matchsticks increases by 2 every time.

Think of a way to use this to find out the number of matchsticks in 
Step 33 (without continuing to write the numbers).
As each time 2 matchsticks are being added, finding out how many

find out.

Expressions Using Letter-Numbers 
What could be an expression describing the rule/formula to find out 
the number of matchsticks at any step?
The pattern is such that in Step 10, nine 2s and an added 3 (3 + 2 × 
9) gives the number of matchsticks; in Step 11, ten 2s and an added 
3 (3 + 2 × 10) gives the number of matchsticks. For step y, what is 
the expression?
It is: one less than y (i.e. y – 1) 2s and a 3.
Therefore, the expression is
3 + 2 × (y – 1).
This expression gives the number of matchsticks in Step y. Now we 
can find the number of matchsticks at any step quickly.
You might have already noticed that there is a 2 in the first step also, 
3 = 1 + 2. Using this, the expression we get is 
2y + 1.
Does the above expression also give the number of matchsticks at each 
step correctly? Are these expressions the same?
We can check by simplifying the expression 3 + 2 × (y – 1).
3 + 2 × (y – 1) = 3 + 2y – 2
= 2y + 1.
Both expressions are the same.
There is a different way to count, or see the pattern. Let us take a 
look at the picture again.
Matchsticks are placed in two orientations — (a) horizontal ones at 
the top and bottom, and (b) the ones placed diagonally in the middle. 
For example, in step 2 there are 2 matchsticks placed horizontally and 
3 matchsticks placed diagonally. 
What are these numbers in Step 3 and Step 4?
How does the number of matchsticks change in each orientation as the 
steps increase? Write an expression for the number of matchsticks at 
Step ‘y’ in each orientation. Do the two expressions add up to 2y + 1?

•	 Algebraic expressions are used in formulas to model patterns 
and mathematical relationships between quantities, and to make 
predictions.
•	 Algebraic expressions use not only numbers but also letter-numbers. 
The rules for manipulating arithmetic expressions also apply to 
algebraic expressions. These rules can be used to reduce algebraic 
expressions to their simplest forms.
•	 Algebraic expressions can be described in ordinary language, and 
vice versa. Patterns or relationships that are easily written using 
algebra can often be long and complex in ordinary language. This is 
one of the advantages of algebra.
