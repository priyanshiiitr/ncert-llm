WORKING WITH 
FRACTIONS
8.1 Multiplication of Fractions
Aaron walks 3 kilometres in 1 hour. 
How far can he walk in 5 hours?
This is a simple question. We know 
that to find the distance, we need to 
find the product of 5 and 3, i.e., we 
multiply 5 and 3. 
Distance covered in 1 hour = 3 km.
Therefore, 
Distance covered in 5 hours
= 5 × 3 km
= 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 km
= 15 km.
Aaron’s pet tortoise walks at a much slower pace. It can walk only 1
4  
kilometre in 1 hour. How far can it walk in 3 hours?
Here, the distance covered in an hour is a fraction. This does not 
matter. The total distance covered is calculated in the same way, as 
multiplication.
Distance covered in 1 hour = 1
4 km.

Therefore, distance covered in 3 hours = 3 × 1

= 1

4 + 1

= 3
4 km.
The tortoise can walk 3
4 km in 3 hours.
Let us consider a case where the time spent walking is a fraction of 
an hour.
We saw that Aaron can walk 3 kilometres in 1 hour. How far can he 
walk in 1
5 hours?
We continue to calculate the total distance covered through 
multiplication.
Distance covered in 1
5 hours = 1
5  × 3 km.
Finding the product:
Distance covered in 1 hour = 3 km.
In 1
5 hours, distance covered is equal to the length we get by dividing 
3 km into 5 equal parts, which is  3
5 km.
This tells us that 1
5 × 3 = 3
5 .
How far can Aaron walk in 2
5 hours?
Distance in 1 hour
Distance in 1

Working with Fractions
Once again, we have —
Distance covered = 2
5 × 3 km.
Finding the product:
1.	 We can first find the distance covered in 1
5 hours.
2.	 Since, the duration 2
5  is twice 1
5, we multiply this distance by 2 to 
get the total distance covered.
Here is the calculation.
Distance covered in 1 hour = 3 km.
1.	 Distance covered in 1
5 hour 
	
= The length we get by dividing 3 km in 5 equal parts	
	
	
	
=  3
5 km.
2.	 Multiplying this distance by 2, we get 
	
2 × 3
5 = 6
5 km.
From this we can see that
5 × 3 = 6
5.
Discussion
We did this multiplication as follows:
•	 	First, we divided the 
multiplicand, 3 , by the 
denominator of the multiplier, 5, to get 3

•	 	We then multiplied the result by the numerator of the multiplier, 
that is 2, to get 6

Thus, 
whenever 
we 
need 
to 
multiply a fraction and a whole 
number, we follow the steps above.
Example

5

How much land in all did she give to her grandchildren?

It costs ₹10 for 1 1

So far, we have learnt multiplication of a whole number with a 
fraction, and a fraction with a whole number. What happens when 
both numbers in the multiplication are fractions?
Multiplying Two Fractions
We know, that Aaron’s pet tortoise can walk only 1
4 km in 1 hour. How 
far can it walk in half an hour?
Following 
our 
approach 
of 
using 
multiplication to solve such problems, we 
have,
Distance covered in 1
2 hour = 1
2 × 1
4 km.
Finding the product:
Distance covered in 1 hour = 1
4 km.
Therefore, the distance covered in 1
2 an hour is the length we get by 
dividing 1
4 into 2 equal parts.
To find this, it is useful to represent fractions using the unit square 
to stand for a “whole”.

Now we divide this 1
4 into 2 equal parts. What do we get?
What fraction of the whole is shaded?
Since the whole is divided into 8 equal parts 
and one of the parts is shaded, we can say that 1
8 
of the whole is shaded. So, the distance covered 
by the tortoise in half an hour is 1
8 km.
This tells us that 1
2 × 1
4 = 1

If the tortoise walks faster and it can cover 2
5 km in 1 hour, how far will 
it walk in 3

Finding the product:
(i)	
First find the distance covered in 1

hour.
(i)

5 into

Taking the unit square as the whole, the 
shaded part (in Fig.   8.1) is a region we get 
when we divide 2
5 into 4 equal parts.
How much of the whole is it?
The whole is divided into
5 rows and 4 columns,
creating 5 × 4 = 20 equal parts.
Number of these parts shaded = 2.
So, the distance covered in 1
4 of an hour = 2
20 .

Discussion
In the case of a fraction multiplied by 
another fraction, we follow a method 
similar to the one we used, when 
we multiplied a fraction by a whole 
number. We multiplied as follows:
5 ÷ 4 = 2

Divide the multiplicand by 4.

First, let us represent 3
2, taking the unit square as 
the whole. Since, the fraction 3
2 is one whole and a 
half, it can be seen as follows:
Following the steps of multiplication, we need to 
first divide this fraction 3
2 into 4 equal parts. It can 
be done as shown in the Fig. 8.2 with the yellow 
shaded region representing the fraction obtained 
by dividing 3
2 into 4 equal parts. What is its value?
We see that the whole is divided into —
2 rows and 4 columns,
creating 2 × 4 = 8 equal parts.
Number of parts shaded = 3.
So the yellow shaded part = 3
8.

Connection between the Area of a Rectangle and Fraction 
Multiplication
In the Fig. 8.3, what is the length and breadth of the shaded rectangle? 
Since we started with a unit square (of side 1 unit), the length and 
breadth are 1
2 unit and 1
4 unit.
What is the area of this rectangle? We see 
that 8 such rectangles give the square of area 
1 square unit. So, the area of each rectangle 
is 1
8 square units.
Do you see any relation between the area and 
the product of length and breadth?
The area of a rectangle of fractional sides equals the product 
of its sides.
In general, if we want to find the product of two fractions, we can 
find the area of the rectangle formed with the two fractions as its sides.

Working with Fractions
Doing this by representing the fractions using a unit square is 
cumbersome. Let us find the product by observing what we did in the 
above cases.
In each case, the whole is divided into rows and columns. 
The number of rows is the denominator of the multiplicand, which 
is 18 in this case.
The number of columns is the denominator 
of the multiplier, which is 12 in this case.
Thus, the whole is divided into 18 × 12 equal 
parts.
So, 1
18 × 1
12 = 
(18×12) = 1
216.
Thus, 
when 
two 
fractional 
units 
are 
multiplied, their product is
(product of denominators).
We express this as:
b × 1
d = 
b × d  .

Now, find 5
12 × 7
18. 
Like the previous case, let us find the product 
by performing the multiplication, step by step.
First, the whole is divided into 18 rows and 12 
columns creating 12 × 18 equal parts.
The value we get by dividing 7
18 into 12 equal 
parts is 
(12 × 18) .

Then, we multiply this result by 5 to get 
the product. This is (5 ×  7)
(12 × 18).
So, 5
12 × 7
8 = (5 × 7)
(12 × 18) = 35
216. 
From this we can see that, in general,
a
b × c
d = a × c
b × d .
This formula was first stated in this general form by Brahmagupta in 
his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE. 
The formula above works even when the multiplier or multiplicand 
is a whole number. We can simply rewrite the whole number as a 
fraction with denominator 1. For example,
3 × 3
4 can be written 3
1 × 3
= 3×3
1×4 = 9
4.
And,
5 × 4 can be written 3
5 × 4
=  3 × 4
5 × 1 = 12

Multiplication of Fractions — Simplifying to Lowest Form
Multiply the following fractions and express the product in its lowest 
form:
7  × 5
24 
Instead of multiplying the numerators (12 and 5) and denominators 
(7 and 24) first and then simplifying, we could do the following:
7  × 5
24 = 12 × 5
7 × 24
We see that both the circled numbers have a common factor of 12. 
We know that a fraction remains the same when the numerator and 
denominator are divided by the common factor. In this case, we can 
divide them by 12.

When multiplying fractions, we can first divide the numerator

factors.
A Pinch of History
In India, the process of reducing a fraction to its lowest terms — known 
as apavartana — is so well known that it finds mention even in a 
non-mathematical work. A Jaina scholar Umasvati (c. 150 CE) used it as 
a simile in a philosophical work.

Is the Product Always Greater than the Numbers 
Multiplied?
Since, we know that when a number is multiplied by 1, the product 
remains unchanged, we will look at multiplying pairs of numbers 
where neither of them is 1.
When we multiply two counting numbers greater than 1, say 3 and 
5, the product is greater than both the numbers being multiplied.
3 × 5 = 15 
The product, 15, is more than both 3 and 5.
But what happens when we multiply 1
4 and 8?
4 × 8 = 2
In the above multiplication the product, 2, is greater than 1
4, but less 
than 8.

Working with Fractions
let us express 3
4 as 15
20 and 2
5 as 8

From this we can see that the product is less than both the numbers.
When do you think the product is greater than both the numbers 
multiplied, when is it in between the two numbers, and when is it 
smaller than both?
[Hint: The relationship between the product and the numbers 
multiplied  depends on whether they are between 0 and 1 or they 
are greater than 1. Take different pairs of numbers and observe their 
product. For each multiplication, consider the following questions.]

multiplied and the product? Fill in the blanks:
•	 	When one of the numbers being multiplied is between 0 and 1,

Discussion
In each of the division problems above, observe how we found the 
answer. Can we frame a rule that tells us how to divide two fractions?
Let us consider the previous problem.
In every division problem we have 
a dividend, divisor and quotient. The 
technique we have been using to get 
the quotient is:
1.	 	First, find the number which gives 
1 when multiplied by the divisor. 
We see that the resulting number is 
a fraction whose numerator is the 
divisor’s denominator and denominator is the divisor’s numerator.
	
For the divisor 3
5 this fraction is 5
3. We call 5
3 the reciprocal of 3
5. 
When we multiply a fraction by its reciprocal, we get 1. So, the first 
step in our technique is to find the divisor’s reciprocal.

2.	 	We then multiply the dividend with this reciprocal to get the

Summarising, to divide two fractions:
•	 	Find the reciprocal of the divisor
•	 	Multiply this by the dividend to get the quotient.
            So,	
 a
b ÷ c
d = d
c × a
b = d × a
c × b.
This can be rewritten as:
a
b ÷ c
d = a
b × d
c = a × d
b × c. 
As with methods and formulas for addition, subtraction, and 
multiplication of fractions that you learnt earlier, this method and 
formula for division of fractions, in this general form, was first explicitly 
stated by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (628 CE).
So, to evaluate, for example, 2
3 ÷ 3
5 using Brahmagupta’s formula 
above, we write:
3 ÷ 3
5 = 2
3 × 5
3 = 2 × 5
3 × 3 = 10

Dividend, Divisor and the Quotient
When we divide two whole numbers, say 6 ÷ 3, we get the quotient 2. 
Here the quotient is less than the dividend.
6 ÷ 3 = 2, 2 < 6
But what happens when we divide 6 by 1
4 ?
6 ÷ 1
4 = 24. 
Here the quotient is greater than the dividend!
What happens when we divide 1
8 by 1
4 ?
8 ÷ 1
4 = 1
2. 
Here too the quotient is greater than the dividend.
When do you think the quotient is less than the dividend and when 
is it greater than the dividend?
Is there a similar relationship between the divisor and the quotient?

Use your understanding of such relationships in multiplication to 
answer the questions above.
8.3 Some Problems Involving Fractions
Example 3: Leena made 5 cups of tea. She used 1
4 litre of milk for this. 
How much milk is there in each cup of tea?
Leena used 1
4 litres of milk in 5 cups of tea. So, in 1 cup of tea the 
volume of milk should be:
4 ÷ 5.
Writing this as multiplication, we have:
5 × (milk per cup) = 1
4.
We perform the division as follows as per Brahmagupta’s method:
The reciprocal of 5 (the divisor) is 1
5.
Multiplying this reciprocal by the dividend ( 1
4 ), we get
5 × 1
4 = 1
20.
So, each cup of tea has 1
20 litre of milk.
Example 4: Some of the oldest examples of working with non-unit 
fractions occur in humanity’s oldest geometry texts, the Śhulbasūtra. 
Here is an example from Baudhāyana’s Śhulbasūtra (c. 800 BCE). 
Cover an area of 7 1
2 square units with square bricks each of whose 
sides is 1
5 units.

Milk in

How many such square bricks are needed?
Each square brick has an area of 1
5 × 1
5 = 1
25 square units.
The total area to be covered is 7 1
2 sq. units = 15
2  sq. units.
As (Number of bricks) × (Area of a brick) = Total Area,
Number of bricks = 15
2  ÷ 1
25. 
The reciprocal of the divisor is 25.
Multiplying the reciprocal by the dividend, we get
25 × 15
2  = 25 × 15
 = 375

Example 5: This problem was posed by Chaturveda Pṛithūdakasvāmī

together, in how much time will they fill the cistern? 
Let us solve this problem step by step.
In a day, the number of times —
•	 	the first fountain will fill the cistern is 1÷ 1 = 1
•	 	the second fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ 1
2 = _____
•	 	the third fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷  1

Fractional Relations
Here is a square with some lines drawn inside.
Fig. 8.4
What fraction of area of the whole square does the shaded region 
occupy? 
There are different ways to solve this problem. Here is one of them:
Let the area of the whole square be 1 square unit.
We can see that the top right square (in Fig. 8.5), occupies 1
4 of the 
area of the whole square.

Let us look at this red square. The area of the triangle inside it 
(coloured yellow) is half the area of the red square. So,	 	
the area of the yellow triangle = 1
2 × 1
4 = 1
8 square units.
What fraction of this yellow triangle is shaded? 
The shaded region occupies 3
4 of the area of the 
yellow triangle. Are you able to see why?
The area of shaded part = 3
4 × 1
8 = 3
32 square units.
Thus, the shaded region occupies 3
32 of the area of the whole square.
In each of the figures given below, find the fraction of the big square 
that the shaded region occupies.

chapter.
A Dramma-tic Donation
The 
following 
problem 
is 
translated 
from 
Bhāskarāchārya’s 
(Bhāskara II’s) book, Līlāvatī, written in 1150 CE. 
“O wise one! A miser gave to a beggar 1
5 of 1
16 of 1
4 of  1
2 of 2
3 of 3
4 of 
a dramma. If you know the mathematics of fractions well, tell me O 
child, how many cowrie shells were given by the miser to the beggar.”
Dramma refers to a silver coin used in those times. The tale says that 
1 dramma was equivalent to 1280 cowrie shells. Let’s see what fraction 
of a dramma the person gave:
(
2 × 2
3 × 3
4 × 1
5 × 1
16 × 1
4)
th
 part of a dramma.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7
Evaluating it gives 
7680 . 
Upon simplifying to its lowest form, we get
7680 = 
1280.
So, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar.
You can see in the answer Bhāskarāchārya’s humour! The miser had 
given the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie).
Around the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in 
different kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used 
were gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called 
drammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and 
cowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied 
depending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of 
coins and their purity. 
Gold coins had high-value and were used in large transactions and 
to store wealth. Silver coins were more commonly used in everyday 
transactions. Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller 
transactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were 
used in very small transactions and as change.
If we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4 
copper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells, 
1 copper pana = 1
48 gold dinar (
12 × 1
4)
1 cowrie shell =____ copper panas
1 cowrie shell =____ gold dinar.
A Pinch of History  
As you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing 
a critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing 
and dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions 
as we use them today — equipped with the arithmetic operations of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in 
India. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Śhulbasūtra — which 
go back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction 
of fire altars for rituals — used general non-unit fractions extensively, 
including performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3.
Fractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of 
India as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to 
the reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of 
the revered Jain scholar Umasvati.
Working with Fractions
General rules for performing arithmetic operations on fractions — 
in essentially the modern form in which we carry them out today — 
were first codified by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 
628 CE. We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting 
general fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta 
wrote: 
“Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the 
product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.” 
(Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.1.3)
That is,	 	
	
	
	
a
b × c
d = a × c
b × d .
For division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote:
“The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator 
and denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then 
multiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new) 
denominator.”
Bhāskara II in his book Līlāvatī in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s 
statement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal:
“Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of 
the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Līlāvatī, Verse 2.3.40)
Both of these verses are equivalent to the formula: 
a
b ÷ c
d = a
b ×d
c = a × d
b × c .
Bhāskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣhya on 
Aryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the 
geometric interpretation of multiplication 
of fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms 
of the division of a square into rectangles 
via equal divisions along the length and 
breadth. 
Many 
other 
Indian 
mathematicians, 
such as Śhrīdharāchārya (c. 750 CE), 
Mahāvīrāchārya (c. 850 CE), Caturveda 
Pṛithūdakasvāmī (c. 860 CE), and Bhāskara II 
(c. 1150 CE) developed the usage of arithmetic 
of fractions significantly further. 
The Indian theory of fractions and 
arithmetic operations on them was 
transmitted to, and its usage developed further, by Arab and African 
mathematicians such as al-Hassâr (c. 1192 CE) of Morocco. The theory 
was then transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few

centuries, and came into general use in Europe in only around the 
17th century, after which it spread worldwide. The theory is indeed 
indispensable today in modern mathematics.

Chess Puzzles —  
Non-attacking Queens
Chess is a popular 2-player strategy game. This game has its origins 
in India. It is played on an 8 × 8 chequered grid. There are 2 sets of 
pieces — black and white — one set for each player. Find out how 
each piece should move and the rules of the game.
Here is a famous chess-based puzzle. From its current position, 
a Queen piece can move along the horizontal, vertical or diagonal. 
Place 4 Queens such that no 2 queens attack each other. For example, 
the arrangement below is not valid as the queens are in the line of 
attack of each other.
Now, place 8 queens on this 8 × 8 grid so that no 2 queens attack 
each other!
