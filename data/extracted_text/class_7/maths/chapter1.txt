1.1 A Lakh Varieties!
Eshwarappa is a farmer in Chintamani, 
a town in Karnataka. He visits the 
market regularly to buy seeds for his 
rice field. During one such visit he 
overheard a conversation between 
Ramanna and Lakshmamma. Ramanna 
said, “Earlier our country had about a 
lakh varieties of rice. Farmers used to 
preserve different varieties of seeds 
and use them to grow rice. Now, we 
only have a handful of varieties. Also, 
farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds”.
Lakshmamma said, “There is a seed bank near my house. So far, they 
have collected about a hundred indigenous varieties of rice seeds from 
different places. You can also buy seeds from there.”
You may have heard the word ‘lakh’ 
before. Do you know how big one lakh is? Let 
us find out.
Eshwarappa shared this incident with his 
daughter Roxie and son Estu .
Estu was surprised to know that there 
were about one lakh varieties of rice in this 
country. He wondered “One lakh! So far I 
have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new 
variety each day, would we even come close 
to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100 
years?”
What do you think? Guess.

Roxie and Estu found that if they ate 
one variety of rice a day, they would come 
nowhere close to a lakh in a lifetime! Roxie 
suggests, “What if we ate 2 varieties of 
rice every day? Would we then be able to 
eat 1 lakh varieties of rice in 100 years?”
What if a person ate 3 varieties of rice every day? Will they be able to 
taste all the lakh varieties in a 100 year lifetime? Find out.
Estu said, “We know how many days there are in a year — 365, if 
we ignore leap years. If we live for y years, the number of days in our 
lifetime will be 365 × y.”

1.	 According to the 2011 Census, the population of the town of 
Chintamani was about 75,000. How much less than one lakh is 75,000?
2.	 	The estimated population of Chintamani in the year 2024 is 1,06,000. 
How much more than one lakh is 1,06,000?

to 2024?
Getting a Feel of Large Numbers
You may have come across interesting facts like these: 
•	 	The world’s tallest statue is the ‘Statue of Unity’ 
in Gujarat depicting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Its 
height is about 180 metres.
•	 Kunchikal waterfall in Karnataka is said to drop 
from a height of about 450 metres.
It is not always easy to get a sense of how big these measurements 
are. But, we can get a better sense of their size when we compare them 
with something familiar. Let us see an example.
Look at the picture on the right. Somu is 1 metre tall. If each floor 
is about four times his height, what is the approximate height of the 
building?
Which is taller — The Statue of Unity or this building? How much taller? 
____________m.
We can see that the 
height of the Statue of Unity 
is close to 4 times the height

Is One Lakh a Very Large Number?
Eshwarappa asked Roxie and Estu, “Is a lakh big or 
small?” 
Roxie feels that 1 lakh is a large number:
•	 “We had one lakh varieties of rice — that 
is a lot.”
•	 “Living 1 lakh days would mean living for 274 
years — that is a really long time!”
•	 “If 1 lakh people stood shoulder to shoulder in a line they could 
stretch as far as 38 kilometres.”
Estu, however, thinks it is not that big:
•	 “Do you know that the cricket stadium in 
Ahmedabad has a seating capacity of more 
than 1 lakh? One lakh people in such a small 
area!”
•	 “Most humans have 80,000 to 1,20,000 hairs on 
their heads. Imagine, 1 lakh hairs fit in such a 
tiny space!”
•	 “I heard that there are some species of fish 
where a female fish can lay almost one lakh 
eggs at once very comfortably. Some even lay tens of lakhs of eggs 
at a time.”
How do you view a lakh — is a lakh big or small?
Reading and Writing Numbers
We have already been using commas for 5-digit numbers like 45,830 in 
the Indian place value system. As numbers grow bigger, using commas 
helps in reading the numbers easily. We use a comma in between the 
digits representing the “ten thousands” place and the “one lakh” place 
as you have seen just before (1,00,000).
The number name of 12,78,830 is twelve lakh seventy eight thousand 
eight hundred thirty.
Similarly, the number 15,75,000 in words is fifteen lakh seventy five 
thousand.

What if we press the +10,00,000 button ten times? What number 
will come up? How many zeroes will it have? What should we call it? 
The number will be 100 lakhs, which is also called a crore. 1 crore is 
written as 1,00,00,000 — it is 1 followed by seven zeroes.
1.3 Of Crores and Crores!
The table below shows some numbers according to both the Indian 
system and the American system (also called the International system) 
of naming numerals and placing commas. Observe the placement of 
commas in both systems.

One arab or One 
hundred crores
1,000,000,000
One billion
Notice that in the Indian system, commas are placed to group the 
digits in a 3-2-2-2... pattern from right to left (thousands, lakhs, crores, 
etc.). In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a 
3-3-3-3… pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.).
The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan, 
Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and 
Myanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words 
lakṣha (लक्ष) and koṭi (कोटि‍). The American system is also used in many 
countries.
Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore.
1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes.
1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes.
A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a 
lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand 
is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).

What do you think of this conversation? Have you read or heard 
such headlines or statements?
Very often, exact numbers are not required and just an approximation 
is sufficient. For example, according to the 2011 census, the population 
of Chintamani town is 76,068. Instead, saying that the population is 
about 75,000 is enough to give an idea of how big the quantity is.
Bappi, call and 
check if Toofan 
Express is on time.
What 
number 
did you 
call?
I called  the 
rounded off 
number, of course! 
My teacher told 
us that efficient 
people deal with 
rounded off 
numbers.
There are situations where it makes sense to round up a number 
(rounding up is when the approximated number is more than the actual 
number). For example, if a school has 732 people including students, 
teachers and staff: the principal might order 750 sweets instead of 
700 sweets.  
There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down 
is when the approximated number is less than the actual number). For 
example, if the cost of an item is ₹470, the shopkeeper may say that the 
cost is around ₹450 instead of saying it is around ₹500. 
Think and share situations where it is appropriate to (a) round up, 
(b) round down, (c) either rounding up or rounding down is okay and 
(d) when exact numbers are needed.
Large Numbers Around Us
Nearest Neighbours
With large numbers it is useful to know the nearest thousand, lakh or 
crore. For example, the nearest neighbours of the number 6,72,85,183 
are shown in the table below.
Nearest thousand     
6,72,85,000
Nearest ten thousand     
6,72,90,000
Nearest lakh     
6,73,00,000
Nearest ten lakh     
6,70,00,000
Nearest crore     
7,00,00,000
Similarly, write the five nearest neighbours for these numbers:
(a)	 3,87,69,957
(b)	 29,05,32,481
I have a number for which all five nearest neighbours are 
5,00,00,000. What could the number be? How many such numbers 
are there? 
Roxie and Estu are estimating the values of simple expressions.

Observe the number of digits in the two numbers being multiplied 
and their product in each case. Is there any connection between the 
numbers being multiplied and the number of digits in their product?
Roxie says that the product of two 2-digit numbers can only be a 3- or 
a 4-digit number. Is she correct?
Should we try all possible multiplications with 2-digit numbers to tell 
whether Roxie’s claim is true? Or is there a better way to find out?
She explains her reasoning: “We want to 
know about the number of digits in the product 
of two 2-digit numbers. To know the smallest 
such product I took 10 × 10, so all other products 
will be greater than 100.
To know the greatest such product I 
multiplied the smallest 3-digit numbers (100 
× 100) to get 10,000; so the product of all the 
2-digit multiplications will be less than 10,000.”
Can multiplying a 3-digit number with another 3-digit number give a 
4-digit number?
Can multiplying a 4-digit number with a 2-digit number give a 5-digit 
number?

1.6 Did You Ever Wonder…?
Estu is amused by all these interesting facts about large numbers. While 
thinking about these, he came up with an unusual question, “Could the 
entire population of Mumbai fit into 1 lakh buses?”
What do you think? 
How can we find out?
Let us assume a bus can accommodate 50 people. Then 1 lakh buses 
can accommodate 1 lakh × 50 = 50 lakh people.
Large Numbers Around Us
The population of Mumbai is more than 1 crore 24 lakhs (we saw 
this in an earlier table). So, the entire population of Mumbai cannot fit 
in 1 lakh buses.
The RMS Titanic ship carried about 2500 passengers. Can the population 
of Mumbai fit into 5000 such ships?
Inspired by this strange question, Roxie wondered, “If I could travel 
100 kilometers every day, could I reach the Moon in 10 years?” (The 
distance between the Earth and the Moon is 3,84,400 km.)
How far would she have travelled in a year?
How far would she have travelled in 10 years?
Is it not easier to perform these calculations in stages? You can use 
this method for all large calculations.
Find out if you can reach the Sun in a lifetime, if you travel 1000 
kilometers every day. (You had written down the distance between the 
Earth and the Sun in a previous exercise.)
Make necessary reasonable assumptions and answer the questions 
below:
(a)	 	If a single sheet of paper weighs 5 grams, could you lift one 
lakh sheets of paper together at the same time?
(b)	 	If 250 babies are born every minute across the world, will a 
million babies be born in a day?
(c)	 	Can you count 1 million coins in a day? Assume you can count 
1 coin every second.
Think and create more such fun questions and share them with your 
class.

•	 We came across large numbers — lakhs, crores and arabs; millions 
and billions. We learnt how to read and write these numbers in the 
Indian and American/International naming systems.
(a)	 1 lakh is 1 followed by 5 zeroes: 1,00,000
(b)	 1 crore is 1 followed by 7 zeroes: 1,00,00,000
(c)	 1 million is 1 followed by 6 zeroes: 1,000,000 (which is also ten 
lakhs)
(d)	 1 arab is 1 followed by 9 zeroes: 1,000,000,000 (which is also 100 
crore or 1 billion)
•	 We generally round up or round down large numbers. Many times it 
is enough just to know roughly how big or small something is.
•	 To get a sense of large numbers or quantities, we can check how 
many times bigger they are compared to numbers or quantities that 
are more familiar.
•	 We saw how to factorise numbers and regroup them to make 
multiplications simpler.
•	 We carried out interesting thought experiments such as  — “Would 
one be able to watch 1000 movies in a year?”
