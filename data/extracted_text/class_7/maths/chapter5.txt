PARALLEL AND 
INTERSECTING 
LINES
5.1 Across the Line
Take a piece of square paper and fold it in different ways. Now, on 
the creases formed by the folds, draw lines using a pencil and a scale. 
You will notice different lines on the paper. Take any pair of lines and 
observe their relationship with each other. Do they meet? If they do 
not meet within the paper, do you think they would meet if they were 
extended beyond the paper?
Fig. 5.1
In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between lines on a 
plane surface. The table top, your piece of paper, the blackboard, and 
the bulletin board are all examples of plane surfaces.
Let us observe a pair of lines that meet each other. You will notice 
that they meet at a point. When a pair of lines meet each other at a 
point on a plane surface, we say that the lines intersect each other.
Let us observe what happens when two lines intersect.
How many angles do they form? 
In Fig. 5.2, where line l intersects line m, we can see that four angles 
are formed.

Can two straight lines intersect at more than one point?
Activity 1
Draw two lines on a plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure 
the four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of 
intersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of 
intersection.
What patterns do you observe among these angles?
In Fig. 5.2, if ∠a is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of ∠b, ∠c 
and ∠d, without drawing and measuring them?
We know that ∠a and ∠b together measure 180°, because when they 
are combined, they form a straight angle which measures 180°. So, if 
∠a is 120°, then ∠b must be 60°.
Similarly, ∠b and ∠c together measure 180°. So, if ∠b is 60°, then ∠c 
must be 120°. And ∠c and ∠d together measure 180°. So, if ∠c is 120°, 
then ∠d must be 60°.
Therefore, in Fig. 5.2, ∠a and ∠c measure 120°, and ∠b and ∠d 
measure 60°.
When two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled 
a, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then ∠a and ∠c are equal, and ∠b and ∠d 
are equal!
Is this always true for any pair of intersecting lines?
Check this for different measures of ∠a. Using these measurements, 
can you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of ∠a?
We can generalise our reasoning for Fig. 5.2, without assuming the 
values of ∠a.
Since straight angles measure 180°, we must have ∠a + ∠b = ∠a + ∠d 
= 180°. Hence, ∠b and ∠d are always equal. Similarly, ∠b + ∠a = ∠b + 
∠c = 180°, so ∠a and ∠c must be equal.  
Adjacent angles, like ∠a and ∠b, formed by two lines intersecting 
each other, are called linear pairs. Linear pairs always add up to 180°.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Opposite angles, like ∠b and ∠d, formed by two lines intersecting 
each other, are called vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite 
angles are always equal to each other.
From the above reasoning, we conclude that whenever two lines 
intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. Such a justification is 
called a proof in mathematics.
Figure it Out
List all the linear pairs and vertically opposite angles you 
observe in Fig. 5.3:

Opposite Angles

Measurements and Geometry
You might have noticed that when you measure linear pairs, sometimes 
they may not add up to 180°. Or, when you measure vertically opposite 
angles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this?
There could be different reasons:
•	 Measurement errors because of improper use of measuring 
instruments — in this case, a protractor
•	 Variation in the thickness of the lines drawn. The “ideal” line in 
geometry does not have any thickness! But it is not possible for us 
to draw lines without any thickness
In geometry, we create ideal versions of “lines” and other shapes 
we see around us, and analyse the relationships between them. For 
example, we know that the angle formed by a straight line is 180°. 
So, if another line divides this angle into two parts, both parts should 
add up to 180°. We arrive at this simply through reasoning and not 
by measurement. When we measure, it might not be exactly so, for 
the reasons mentioned above. Still the measurements come out very 
close to what we predict, because of which geometry finds widespread 
application in different disciplines such as physics, art, engineering 
and architecture.
5.2 Perpendicular Lines
Can you draw a pair of intersecting lines such that all four angles are 
equal? Can you figure out what will be the measure of each angle?

If two lines intersect and all four angles are equal, then each angle 
must be a right angle (90°).
Perpendicular lines are a pair of lines which intersect each other 
at right angles (90°). In Fig. 5.4, we can say that lines l and m are 
perpendicular to each other.
5.3 Between Lines
Observe Fig. 5.5 and describe the way the line segments meet or cross 
each other in each case, with appropriate mathematical words (a point, 
an endpoint, the midpoint, meet, intersect) and the degree measure of 
each angle.
For example, line segments FG and FH meet at the endpoint F at an 
angle 115.3°.

Are line segments ST and UV likely to meet if they are extended?
Are line segments OP and QR likely to meet if they are extended?
Here are some examples of lines we notice around us.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
What is common to the lines in the pictures above? They do not seem 
likely to intersect each other. Such lines are called parallel lines.
Parallel lines are a pair of lines that lie on the same plane, and do 
not meet however far we extend them at both ends.
Name some parallel lines you can spot in your classroom.
Parallel lines are often used in artwork and shading.

Note to the Teacher: It is important that the lines lie on the same plane. A line 
drawn on a table and a line drawn on the board may never meet but that does 
not make them parallel.

Activity 2
Take a plain square sheet of paper (use a newspaper for this activity). 
•	 How would you describe the opposite edges of the sheet? They 
are _________________________ to each other.
•	 How would you describe the adjacent edges of the sheet? The 
adjacent edges are _________________________ to each other. They 
meet at a point. They form right angles.
•	 Fold the sheet horizontally in half. A new line is formed 
(see Fig. 5.7).
•	 How many parallel lines do you see now? How does the new line 
segment relate to the vertical sides?
Fig. 5.7
•	 Make one more horizontal fold in the folded sheet. How many 
parallel lines do you see now?
•	 What will happen if you do it once more? How many parallel 
lines will you get? Is there a pattern? Check if the pattern extends 
further, if you make another horizontal fold.
•	 Make a vertical fold in the square sheet. This new vertical line is 
___________ to the previous horizontal lines.
•	 Fold the sheet along a diagonal. Can you find a fold that creates a 
line parallel to the diagonal line?
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Here is another activity for you to try.
•	 Take a square sheet of paper, fold it in the middle and unfold it.
•	 Fold the edges towards the centre line and unfold them.
•	 Fold the top right and bottom left corners onto the creased line to 
create triangles. Refer to Fig. 5.8.
•	 The triangles should not cross the crease lines.
•	 Are a, b and c parallel to p, q and r respectively? Why or why not?

Notations
In mathematics, we use an arrow mark (>) to show that a set of lines is 
parallel. If there is more than one set of parallel lines (as in Fig. 5. 9), the 
second set is shown with two arrow marks and so on. Perpendicular 
lines are marked with a square angle between them.

Note to the Teacher: It is easier to draw vertical and horizontal lines and the 
ones inclined at 45° (on rectangular dot sheets), but drawing a line parallel to 
one which has a different orientation is slightly harder. Let students use their 
intuition for this.
From previous exercises we observed that sometimes it is difficult 
to be sure whether two lines are parallel. To determine this we use the 
idea of transversals.

5.5 Transversals
We saw what happens when two lines intersect in different ways. Let 
us explore what happens when one line intersects two different lines.
l

8

t
m
Fig. 5.14
In Fig. 5.14, line t intersects lines l and m. t is called a transversal. 
Notice that 8 angles are formed when a line crosses a pair of lines.
Is it possible for all the eight angles to have different measurements? 
Why, why not?
What about five different angles — 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2?
In Fig. 5.14, since ∠1 and ∠3 are vertically opposite angles,  they are 
equal. Are there other pairs of vertically opposite angles? We can see 
that there are a total of four pairs of vertically opposite angles and in 
each pair, the angles are equal to each other.
Thus, when a transversal intersects two lines, it forms eight angles 
with a maximum of four distinct angle measures.
5.6 Corresponding Angles
In Fig. 5.14, we notice that the transversal t forms two sets of angles — 
one with line l and another with line m. There are angles in the first set 
that  correspond to angles in the second set based on their position. ∠1 
and ∠5 are called corresponding angles. Similarly, ∠2 and ∠6, ∠3 and 
∠7, ∠4 and ∠8 are the corresponding angles formed when transversal 
t intersects lines l and m.
Activity 3
Draw a pair of lines and a transversal such that they form two 
distinct angles.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Step 1: Draw a line l and a transversal t intersecting it at point X.
Fig. 5.15

l
t
 
Step 2: Measure ∠a formed by lines l and t (let us say it is 60°).
 
a = 60°
l
X
t
Fig. 5.16
How many distinct angles have formed now?
If one angle is 60°, the other angle of the linear pair should be 120°. 
So, we already have two distinct angles.
So, when we draw another line intersecting the transversal t we 
wish to form only two angles, 60° and 120°. 
Step 3: Mark a point Y on line t.
a = 60°
l
X
t
Y
Fig. 5.17
Step 4: Draw a line m through point Y that forms a 60° angle to line t. 
This can be done either by copying ∠a with a tracing paper or you can 
use a protractor to measure the angles.
 
a = 60°
b = 60°
l
m

Y
Fig. 5.18
What do you observe about lines l and m? Do they appear to be 
parallel to each other?
Yes, they do appear to be parallel to each other.
Angles, ∠a and ∠b are corresponding angles formed by the transversal 
t on lines l and m. These corresponding angles are equal to each other.
Parallel and Intersecting Lines
From this we can observe:
When the corresponding angles formed by a transversal on a pair 
of lines are equal to each other, then the pair of lines are parallel 
to each other.
Suppose, we have a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. What 
can be said about the corresponding angles?
Activity 4
Fig. 5.19 has a pair of parallel lines l and m (what is the notation used 
in the figure to indicate they are parallel?) . Line t is the transversal 
across these two lines. ∠a and ∠b are corresponding angles. Take a 
tracing paper and trace ∠a on it. Now place this tracing paper over 
∠b and see if the angles align exactly. You will observe that the angles 
match. Check the other corresponding angles in the figure using a 
protractor. Are all the corresponding angles equal to each other?
l

Corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair 
of parallel lines are always equal to each other.
Activity 5
In Fig. 5.20, draw a transversal t to the lines l and m such that one pair 
of corresponding angles is equal. You can measure the angles with a 
protractor.
l
m
Fig. 5.20
Are you finding it hard to draw a transversal such that the 
corresponding angles are equal?
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
When a pair of lines are not parallel to each other, the corresponding 
angles formed by a transversal can never be equal to each other.
5.7 Drawing Parallel Lines
Can you draw a pair of parallel lines using a ruler and a set square?
Fig. 5.21 shows how you can do it.
Draw a line l with a scale. By sliding your set square you can make 
two lines perpendicular to line l.
Are these two lines parallel to each other? How are we sure that they 
are parallel to each other? What angles are formed between these lines 
and line l?
l
Fig. 5.21
Since we used a set square, the angles measure 90°. The position 
of the lines is different, but they make the same angle with l. If line l 
is seen as a transversal to the two new lines, then the corresponding 
angles measure 90°.
Fig. 5.22
l
As we know these are corresponding angles and they are equal, we 
can be sure that the lines are parallel.
Draw two more parallel lines using the long side of the set square as 
shown in Fig. 5.22.
Parallel and Intersecting Lines
How do you know these two lines are parallel? Can you check if the 
corresponding angles are equal?
Note to the Teacher: Students should be encouraged to check the equality of 
corresponding angles both by using the tracing method and using protractors to 
measure the angles. Pay attention to the language used to make the relationship 
between corresponding angles and parallel lines. Equality of corresponding 
angles is both necessary and sufficient for the pair of lines to be parallel to 
each other.
Figure it Out
Can you draw a line parallel to l, that goes through point A? How will 
you do it with the tools from your geometry box? Describe your method.

Making Parallel Lines through Paper Folding
Let us try to do the same with paper folding. For a line l (given as a 
crease), how do we make a line parallel to l such that it passes through 
point A?
We know how to fold a piece of paper to get a line perpendicular to l. 
Now, try to fold a perpendicular to l such that it passes through point 
A. Let us call this new crease t.
Now, fold a line perpendicular to t passing through A again. Let us 
call this line m. The lines l and m are parallel to each other.

5.8 Alternate Angles
In Fig. 5.25, ∠d is called the alternate angle of ∠f, and ∠c is the alternate 
angle of ∠e. 
a
b
d
c
e
h
g
m
l

f
Fig. 5.25
You can find the alternate angle of a given angle, say ∠f, by first 
finding the corresponding angle of ∠f, which is ∠b and then finding the 
vertically opposite angle of ∠b, which is ∠d.
Activity 6
In Fig. 5.25, if ∠f is 120° what is the measure of its alternate angle ∠d?
We can find the measure of ∠d if we know ∠b because they are 
vertically opposite angles. Remember, vertically opposite angles are 
equal.
What is the measure of ∠b? It is 120° because it is the corresponding 
angle of ∠f.
So, ∠d also measures 120°.
In fact, ∠f = ∠b irrespective of the measure of ∠f. Why? Because ∠b 
is the corresponding angle of ∠f.
Similarly, ∠b = ∠d irrespective of the measure of ∠b. Why? Because 
∠d is the vertically opposite angle of ∠b. So, it must always be the 
case that
∠f = ∠d
Using our understanding of corresponding angles without any 
measurements, we have justified that alternate angles are always equal.
Alternate angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair of 
parallel lines are always equal to each other.
Example 1: In Fig. 5.26, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the 
transversal t. If ∠6 is 135°, what are the measures of the other angles? 
Parallel and Intersecting Lines
l
t
m

5
135°
8
Fig. 5.26
Solution: ∠6 is 135°, so ∠2 is also 135°, because it is the corresponding 
angle of ∠6 and the lines l and m are parallel. 
∠8 is 135°, because it is the vertically opposite angle of ∠6. ∠4 is 135° 
because it is the corresponding angle of ∠8.
∠2 is 135° because is the vertically opposite angle of ∠4. So, ∠2, ∠4, 
∠6, and ∠8 are all 135°.
∠5 and ∠6 are a linear pair, together they measure 180°. If ∠6 is 
135°, then
∠5 = 180 – 135 = 45°
We can similarly find out that ∠1, ∠3, and ∠7 measure 45°.
Example 2: In Fig. 5.27, lines l and m are intersected by the transversal 
t. If ∠a is 120° and ∠f is 70°, are lines l and m parallel to each other?
g
l
m
t
b
a

e
120°
70°
Fig. 5.27
Solution: ∠a is 120°, so ∠b is 60° because ∠a and ∠b form a linear pair.
∠b is a corresponding angle of ∠f. If l and m are parallel, ∠b should be 
equal to ∠f, however, they are not equal.
Therefore, lines l and m are not parallel to each other as the corresponding 
angles formed by the transversal t are not equal to each other.
Example 3: In Fig. 5.28, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the 
transversal t. If ∠3 is 50°, what is the measure of ∠6? 
l
m
t
50°
1
3
6
8
Fig. 5.28
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
Solution: ∠3 is 50°; therefore, ∠2 is 130°, because ∠2 and ∠3 form a 
linear pair, and linear pairs always add up to 180°.
∠2 and ∠6 are corresponding angles, and they need to be equal since 
lines l and m are parallel.
So, ∠6 is 130°.
Angles ∠3 and ∠6 are called interior angles.
 
Is there a relation between ∠3 and ∠6? You could try to find the 
relationship by taking different values for ∠3 and see what ∠6 is. 
Once you find a relation, try to justify it or prove that this relation 
holds always. You will find that the sum of the interior angles on 
the same side of the transversal always add up to 180°.
Example 4: In Fig. 5.29, line segment AB is parallel to CD and AD is 
parallel to BC. ∠DAC is 65° and ∠ADC is 60°. What are the measures of 
angles ∠CAB, ∠ABC, and ∠BCD?
Solution: Let us observe the parallel lines AB and CD. AD is a 
transversal of these two lines.	
65°
60°
A
B
C
D
Fig. 5.29
We know that the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal 
on a pair of parallel lines adds up to 180°. So
∠ADC + ∠DAB = 180° 
60° + ∠DAB = 180°. 
So ∠DAB = 120°.
Can we find ∠CAB from this?
∠DAB = ∠DAC + ∠CAB. 
So 120° = 65° + ∠CAB.
So ∠CAB = 55°.
Let us observe the parallel line segments AD and BC. They are 
intersected by a transversal CD. So, ∠ADC + ∠BCD = 180°, because they 
are interior angles on the same side of the transversal. Since ∠ADC is 
given as 60°, ∠BCD = 120°
Similarly, we find ∠ABC = 60°.
Therefore, in Fig. 5.29, ∠CAB = 55°, ∠ABC = 60°, and ∠BCD = 120°.

5.9 Parallel Illusions
There do not seem to be any parallel lines here. Or, are there?
 	
 What causes these illusions?
Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 
•	 When two lines intersect, they form four angles. The vertically 
opposite angles are equal and the linear pairs add up to 180°.
•	 When two lines intersect and the angles formed are 90° (i.e., all four 
angles are equal), the lines are said to be perpendicular to each other.
•	 When two lines never intersect on a plane, they are called parallel 
lines.
•	 When a line t intersects another pair of lines, it is called a transversal 
and it forms 2 sets of 4 angles. Each of the 4 angles in the first set has 
a corresponding angle in the second set.
•	 When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the 
corresponding angles are equal. When a transversal intersects a pair 
of lines and the corresponding angles are equal, then the pair of lines 
is parallel.
•	 When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the alternate 
angles are equal.
•	 The interior angles on the same side formed by a transversal 
intersecting a pair of parallel lines always add up to 180°.
SUMMARY
