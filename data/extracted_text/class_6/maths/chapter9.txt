SYMMETRY
Look around you — you may find many objects that catch your 
attention. Some such things are shown below:
Butterfly
Flower 
Pinwheel  
Rangoli 
There is something beautiful about the pictures above. 
The flower looks the same from many different angles. What 
about the butterfly? No doubt, the colours are very attractive. But 
what else about the butterfly appeals to you?
In these pictures, it appears that some parts of the figure are 
repeated and these repetitions seem to occur in a definite pattern. 
Can you see what repeats in the beautiful rangoli figure? In the 
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
rangoli, the red petals come back onto themselves when the flower 
is rotated by 90˚ around the centre and so do the other parts of the 
rangoli.
What about the pinwheel? Can you spot which pattern is repeating? 
Hint: Look at the hexagon first.
Now, can you say what figure repeats 
along each side of the hexagon? What 
is the shape of the figure that is stuck to 
each side? Do you recognise it? How do 
these shapes move as you move along the 
boundary of the hexagon? What about 
the other pictures — what is it about 
those structures that appeals to you and 
what are the patterns in those structures 
that repeat?
On the other hand, look at this picture 
of clouds. There is no such repetitive pattern.
We can say that the first four figures are symmetrical and the last one is 
not symmetrical. A symmetry refers to a part or parts of a figure that 
are repeated in some definite pattern.

9.1 Line of Symmetry
Figure (a) shows the picture of a blue triangle with a dotted line. 
What if you fold the triangle along the dotted line? Yes, one half 
of the triangle covers the other half completely. These are called 
mirror halves! 
(a)
(b)
What about Figure (b) with the four puzzle pieces and a dotted line 
passing through the middle? Are they mirror halves? No, when we fold 
along the line, the left half does not exactly fit over the right half.
A line that cuts a figure into two 	parts that exactly overlap when 
folded along that line is called a line of symmetry of the figure.
 Figure it Out 
1.	 Do you see any line of symmetry in the figures at the start of the 
chapter? What about in the picture of the cloud?
2.	 For each of the following figures, identify the line(s) of symmetry

Figures with more than one line of symmetry
Does a square have only one line of symmetry?
Take a square piece of paper. By folding, find all its lines of symmetry. 
Fold 1
Fold 2
Fold 4
Fold 3
Here are the different folds giving different lines of symmetry.
•	 Fold the paper into half vertically.
•	 Fold it again into half horizontally (i.e., you have folded it 
twice). Now open out the folds.
Vertical Fold
Horizontal Fold
Again fold the square into half (for a third time now), but this 
time along a diagonal, as shown in the figure. Again, open it.
Reprint 2025-26
Symmetry
Fold it into half (for the fourth time), but this time along the other 
diagonal, as shown in the figure. Open out the fold.
  Is there any other way to fold the square so that the two halves 
overlap? How many lines of symmetry does the square shape have?
	
Thus, figures can have multiple lines of symmetry. The figures 
below also have multiple lines of symmetry. Can you find them all?
  We saw that the diagonal of a square is also a line of symmetry. 
Let us take a rectangle that is not a square. Is its diagonal a line of 
symmetry?
	 First, see the rectangle and answer this 
question. Then, take a rectangular piece of 
paper and check if the two parts overlap by 
folding it along its diagonal. What do you 
observe?
Reflection
So far we have been saying that when we fold a figure along a line of 
symmetry, the two parts overlap completely. We could also say that 
the part of the figure on one side of the line of symmetry is reflected 
by the line to the other side; similarly, the part of the figure on the 
other side of the line of symmetry is reflected to the first side! Let us 
understand this by labeling some points on the figure.
The figure shows a square with its corners labeled A, B, C and D. 
Let us first consider the vertical line of symmetry. When we reflect 
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
the square along this line, the points B, C on the right get reflected to 
the left side and occupy the positions occupied earlier by A, D. What 
happens to the points A, D? A occupies the position occupied by B and 
D that of C!

  What if we reflect along the diagonal from A to C? Where do 
points A, B, C and D go? What if we reflect along the horizontal line of 
symmetry?
A figure that has a line or lines of symmetry is thus, also said to have 
reflection symmetry.
Generating shapes having lines of symmetry
So far we have seen symmetrical figures and asymmetrical 
figures. How does one generate such symmetrical figures? Let us 
explore this.
Ink Blot Devils
You enjoyed doing this earlier in Class 5. Take a piece of paper. Fold 
it in half. Open the paper and spill a few drops of ink (or paint) on 
one half.
Now press the halves together and then open the paper again.
•	 What do you see?
•	 Is the resulting figure symmetric?
•	 If yes, where is the line of symmetry?
•	 Is there any other line along which it can be folded to produce 
two identical parts?
•	 Try making more such patterns.

9.2 Rotational Symmetry
The paper windmill in the picture looks 
symmetrical but there is no line of symmetry! 
However, if you fold it, the two halves will not 
exactly overlap. On the other hand, if you rotate 
it by 90° about the red point at the centre, the 
windmill looks exactly the same.
We say that the windmill has rotational 
symmetry.
When talking of rotational symmetry, there is always a fixed 
point about which the object is rotated. This fixed point is called the 
centre of rotation.
Will the windmill above look exactly the same when rotated 
through an angle of less than 90°?
No!
An angle through which a figure can be rotated to look exactly the 
same is called an angle of rotational symmetry, or just an angle of 
symmetry, for short.
Reprint 2025-26
Symmetry
For the windmill, the angles of symmetry are 90° (quarter turn), 
180° (half turn), 270° (three-quarter turn) and 360° (full turn). 
Observe that when any figure is rotated by 360°, it comes back to its 
original position, so 360° is always an angle of symmetry.
Thus, we see that the windmill has 4 angles of symmetry.
Do you know of any other shape that has exactly four angles of 
symmetry?
How many angles of symmetry does a square have? How much 
rotation does it require to get the initial square?
We get back a square overlapping with itself after 90° of rotation. 
This takes point A to the position of point B, point B to the position 
of point C, point C to the position of point D, and point D back to the

Example: Find the angles of symmetry of the following strip.
Solution: Let us rotate the strip in a clockwise direction about its centre.
A rotation of 180° results in the figure above. Does this overlap 
with the original figure.
No. Why?
Another rotation through 180° from this position gives the original 
shape.
This figure comes back to its original shape only after one 
complete rotation through 360°. So, we say that this figure does not 
have rotational symmetry.
Rotational Symmetry of Figures with 
Radial Arms
Consider this figure, a picture with 
4 radial arms. How many angles of 
symmetry does it have? What are they? 
Note that the angle between adjacent 
central dotted lines is 90°.
Can you change the angles between 
the radial arms so that the figure still has 
4 angles of symmetry? Try drawing it.
To check if the figure drawn indeed has 4 angles of symmetry, 
you could draw the figure on two different pieces of paper. Cut out 
the radial arms from one of the papers. Keep the figure on the paper 
fixed and rotate the cutout to check for rotational symmetry.
How will you modify the figure above so that it has only two 
angles of symmetry?

Here is one way:
We have seen figures having 4 and 2 angles of symmetry. Can we 
get a figure having exactly 3 angles of symmetry? Can you use radial 
arms for this?
Let us try with 3 radial arms as in the figure below. How many 
angles of symmetry does it have and what are they?
Here is a figure with three radial arms.
Trace and cut out a copy of this figure. By rotating the cutout over 
this figure determine its angles of rotation.
We see that only a full turn or a rotation of 360° will bring the figure 
back into itself. So this figure does not have rotational symmetry as 
360 degrees is its only angle of symmetry.
However, can anything in the figure be changed to make it have 
3 angles of symmetry?
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
Can it be done by changing the angles between the dotted lines?
If a figure with three radial arms should have rotational symmetry, 
then a rotated version of it should overlap with the original. Here 
are rough diagrams of both of them.
If these two figures must overlap, what can you tell about the 
angles?
C
B
A
B
A
C
Observe that ∠A must overlap ∠B, ∠B must overlap ∠C and ∠C 
must overlap ∠A.
So, ∠A = ∠B = ∠C. What must this angle be?
We know that a full turn has 360 degrees. This is equally distributed 
amongst these three angles. So each angle must be 360°
3  = 120°.
So, the radial arms figure with 3 arms shows rotational symmetry 
when the angle between the adjacent dotted lines is 120°. Use paper 
cutouts to verify this observation.
Now how many angles of rotation does the figure have and what 
are they?

240°, 360°.
•	 Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 4 of them: 90°, 
180°, 270°, 360°.
Do you observe something common about the angles of symmetries 
in these cases? The first set of numbers are all multiples of 180. The 
second are all multiples of 120. The third are all multiples of 90. 
	 In each case, the angles are the multiples of the smallest angle. 
You may wonder and ask if this will always happen. What do you

•	 If the smallest angle of symmetry of a figure is a natural number

Is there a smallest angle of symmetry for all figures? It turns out 
that this is the case for most figures, except for the most symmetric 
shapes like the circle, whose symmetries we now discuss.
Symmetries of a circle
The circle is a fascinating figure. What happens when you rotate a 
circle clockwise about its centre? It coincides with itself. It does not 
matter what angle you rotate it by! So, for a circle, every angle is an 
angle of symmetry.
Now take a point on the rim of the circle and join it to the centre. 
Extend the segment to a diameter of the circle. Is that diameter

ask if this will always happen. What do you think? 
Ans. Yes, the angles of symmetry are always the multiples of the smallest angle. For example, 
the second angle is twice the amount of rotation of the first rotation.
