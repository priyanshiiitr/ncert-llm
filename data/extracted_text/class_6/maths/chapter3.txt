NUMBER PLAY
Numbers are used in different contexts and in many different ways 
to organise our lives. We have used numbers to count, and have 
applied the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication 
and division on them, to solve problems related to our daily lives. 
In this chapter, we will continue this journey, by playing with 
numbers, seeing numbers around us, noticing patterns, and learning 
to use numbers and operations in new ways.
  Think about various situations where we use numbers. 
List five different situations in which numbers are used. See what 
your classmates have listed, share, and discuss.
3.1 Numbers can Tell us Things
What are these numbers telling us?
Some children in a park are standing in a line. Each one says a number.
  What do you think these numbers mean?
	
The children now rearrange themselves, and again each one 
says a number based on the arrangement.

Did you figure out what these numbers represent?
Hint: Could their heights be playing a role?
A child says ‘1’ if there is only one taller child standing next to them. 
A child says ‘2’ if both the children standing next to them are taller. 
A child says ‘0’, if neither of the children standing next to them are taller. 
That is each person says the number of taller neighbours they have.
  Try answering the questions below and share your reasoning.
1.	Can the children rearrange themselves so that the children 
standing at the ends say ‘2’?
2.	Can we arrange the children in a line so that all would say 
only 0s?
3.	Can two children standing next to each other say the same 
number? 
4.	There are 5 children in a group, all of different heights. Can 
they stand such that four of them say ‘1’ and the last one says 
‘0’? Why or why not?
5.	For this group of 5 children, is the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 possible? 
6.	Is the sequence 0, 1, 2, 1, 0 possible? Why or why not?
7.	How would you rearrange the five children so that the 
maximum number of children say ‘2’?

A cell is coloured if the number in it is larger than its adjacent 
cells. The number 626 is coloured as it is larger than 577 and 345, 
whereas 200 is not coloured as it is smaller than 577. The number 
198 is coloured as it has only one adjacent cell with 109 in it, and 198 
is larger than 109.

Let’s do the supercells activity with more rows.
Here the neighbouring cells are those that are immediately to the 
left, right, top and bottom.
The rule remains the same­: a 
cell becomes a supercell if the 
number in it is greater than all 
the numbers in its neighbouring 
cells. In Table 1, 8632 is greater 
than all its neighbours 4580, 
8280, 4795 and 1944.

3.10 An Unsolved Mystery — the Collatz Conjecture!
Look at the sequences below—the same rule is applied in all the 
sequences:
a.	 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
b.	 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
c.	 21, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
d.	 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
Do you see how these sequences were formed? 
Reprint 2025-26
Number Play
The rule is: one starts with any number; if the number is even, 
take half of it; if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1; 
repeat.
Notice that all four sequences above eventually reached the 
number 1. In 1937, the German mathematician, Lothar Collatz 
conjectured that the sequence will always reach 1, regardless of 
the whole number you start with. Even today — despite many 
mathematicians working on it — it remains an unsolved problem as 
to whether Collatz’s conjecture is true! Collatz’s conjecture is one of 
the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.
 Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting 
with your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1?  
Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences 
will eventually reach 1?  Why or why not?
3.11 Simple Estimation
At times, we may not know or need an exact count of things and 
an estimate is sufficient for the purpose at hand. For example, 
your school headmaster might know the exact number of students 
enrolled in your school, but you may only know an estimated 
count. How many students are in your school? About 150? 400? A 
thousand?
Paromita’s class section has 32 children. The other 2 sections of 
her class have 29 and 35 children. So, she estimated the number of 
children in her class to be about 100. Along with Class 6, her school 
also has Classes 7–10 and each class has 3 sections each. She assumed 
a similar number in each class and estimated the number of students 
in her school to be around 500.

Numbers can be used for many different purposes including, to convey 
information, make and discover patterns, estimate magnitudes, pose 
and solve puzzles, and play and win games. 


Thinking about and formulating set procedures to use numbers for 
these purposes is a useful skill and capacity (called ‘computational 
thinking’).


Many problems about numbers can be very easy to pose, but very 
difficult to solve.  Indeed, numerous such problems are still unsolved 
(for example, Collatz’s Conjecture).

Q3. Fill the table below such that we get as many supercells as possible. Use numbers 
between 100 and 1000 without repetitions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ans. 
 
Q4. Out of the 9 numbers, how many supercells are there in the table above? ___________ 
Ans. 5  
Q5 Find out how many supercells are possible for different numbers of cells. 
Do you notice any pattern? What is the method to fill a given table to get the 
maximum number of supercells? Explore and share your strategy. 
Ans. 
For even number of cells say,2,4,6,… the number of supercells would be respectively, 
                2/2 =1,4/2 =2,6/2=3,… 
For odd number of cells , say 1,3,5,7,… the number of supercells would be respectively  
(1+1)/2= 1, (3+1)/2 = 2, (5+1)/2= 3,(7+1)/2 = 4,… 
To get the maximum number ofsupercells, we have to start by filling the first cell as 
super cell & then fill alternately.  
Q6. Can you fill a supercell table without repeating numbers such that there are no 
supercells? Why or why not? 
Ans. No; the cell which is filled by the greatest number among the given numbers chosen, will 
become super cell irrespective of its position in the table.  
Q7. Will the cell having the largest number in a table always be a supercell? Can the cell 
having the smallest number in a table be a supercell? Why or why not? 
Ans. 
Yes, the largest number in a table will always be a supercell.  
No, the smallest number in a table can never be a supercell as the number in all the 
adjacent cells will be greater than it. 
Q8. Fill a table such that the cell having the second largest number is not a supercell. 
Ans. 
One of the ways could be- 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 8

2 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 8 
Second largest number 
8 is not a supercell.  
 
 
Q10. Make other variations of this puzzle and challenge your classmates. 
Ans.  Some of these could be- 
Can you fill the table with 9 cells such that there are more than 5 super cells? 
Can you fill the table with 9 cells such that there are exactly 4 super cells?

Figure it out  
Q.1.  Pratibha uses the digits ‘4’, ‘7’, ‘3’ and ‘2’, and makes the smallest and largest 4-
digit numbers with them: 2347 and 7432. The difference between these two 
numbers is 7432 – 2347 = 5085. The sum of these two numbers is 9779. Choose 4–
digits to make: 
a. the difference between the largest and smallest numbers greater than 5085. 
b. the difference between the largest and smallest numbers less than 5085. 
c. the sum of the largest and smallest numbers greater than 9779. 
d. the sum of the largest and smallest numbers less than 9779. 
Ans.  Some of the possibilities are– 
a. 7431 – 1347 = 6084 
b. 7433 – 3347 = 4086 
c. 7433 + 3347 = 10780 
d. 7431 + 1347 = 8778 
 
Q.2. What is the sum of the smallest and largest 5-digit palindrome? What is their 
difference? 
Ans.  Smallest 5 digit palindrome = 10001 
largest 5 digit palindrome = 99999 
 
Sum = 10001 + 99999 = 110,000 
 
Difference = 99999 – 10001 = 89,998

Q.3. The time now is 10:01. How many minutes until the clock shows the next palindromic 
time? What about the one after that? 
Ans.  Time Now → 10:01 
Next palindrome time → 11:11 
After 1 hr. 10 min = 70 min the clock will show next palindrome time.  
Next palindrome time = 12:21 which will occur after 2 hr. 20 min = 140 min from 
10:01.

Q. Can we make 1,000 using the numbers in the middle? Why not? What about 14,000, 
15,000 and 16,000? Yes, it is possible. Explore how. What thousands cannot be made? 
Ans.  No; the only number which is smaller than 1000 is 400 and 1000 is not a multiple of 400.  
14000 = 1500 × 8 + 400 × 5 
 
= 12000 + 2000 
 
= 14000 
15000 = 13000 + 400 × 5 
 
= 13000 + 2000 
 
= 15000 
16000 = 1500 × 8 + 400 × 10 
 
= 12000 + 4000 
 
= 16000 
Only one thousand (1000) cannot be made.

Q.1.    Write an example for each of the below scenarios whenever possible. 
Could you find examples for all the cases? If not, think and discuss what could be 
the reason. Make other such questions and challenge your classmates. 
Ans.  
• 5 digit + 5 digit > 90,250 
45,000 + 45,400 = 90,400 > 90,250 
• 5 digit + 3 digit = 6 digit sum  
99,999 + 999 = 100,998 
• 4 digit + 4 digit = 6 digit sum  
Not possible as even the sum of the greatest 4 digit numbers will not give a six 
digit sum. (9999 + 9999 = 19,998) 
[10] 
 
• 5 digit + 5 digit = 6 digit sum  
60,000 + 40,000 = 1,00,000 
• 5 digit + 5 digit = 18,500 
Not possible as smallest 5-digit number is 10,000. 
If both the numbers are 10,000 then the sum is 20,000, which is more than 
18,500.  
• 5 digit – 5 digit  < 56,503 
80,000 – 50,000 < 56,503 
 
 
      < 56,503 
• 5 digit – 3 digit = 4 digit  difference 
10,000 – 999 = 9001 
• 5 digit – 4 digit = 4 digit  difference 
12,000 – 2,500 = 9,500 
• 5 digit – 5 digit = 3 digit  difference 
50,999 – 50,000 = 999 
• 5 digit – 5 digit = 91,500  
Not possible as the difference of the greatest and the smallest 5 digit numbers, 
the maximum difference, can be 99,999 – 10,000 = 89,999 
Some examples of other such questions are- 
1. 5 digit + 5 digit = 7 digit sum  
2. 4 digit + 4 digit = 2900 
More such examples can be made. 
 
Q.2.    Always, Sometimes, Never? 
Below are some statements. Think, explore and find out if each of the statement is 
‘Always true’, ‘Only sometimes true’ or ‘Never true’. Why do you think so? Write 
your reasoning; discuss this with the class. 
a. 5-digit number + 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number 
b. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 4-digit number 
c. 4-digit number + 2-digit number gives a 6-digit number 
d. 5-digit number – 5-digit number gives a 5-digit number 
e. 5-digit number – 2-digit number gives a 3-digit number 
Ans. a. Only sometimes true.  
 20,000 + 80,000 = 1,00,000 not a 5 digit number 
b. Only sometimes true  
 9,999 + 99 = 10,098  not a 4 digit number 
c. Never true  
 9,999 + 99 = 10,098  
On adding the greatest 4 digit and the greatest 2 digit numbers, we can reach only 5 
digit number 10,098. So there is no possibility of getting a 6 digit number.  
d. Only sometimes true 
Ex. 12,000 – 10,000 = 2,000  
5 digit – 5 digit = 4 digit  
e. Never true  
 Ex. 10,000 – 99 = 9901  
[11] 
 
Even if the greatest 2 digit numbers is subtracted from the smallest 5 digit number, 4 
digit number will be obtained.

 Q. Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting with your favourite 
whole numbers. Do you always reach 1? 
Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences will eventually 
reach 1? Why or why not? 
Ans.   a) 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 
 b) 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 
Yes we always reach 1. 
The even numbers are halved and when we have an odd number we convert it into 
an even number by multiplying by 3 and adding 1 so that eventually it can be halved 
again. The smallest even number is 2 so we will reach 1 for sure. 
 
Q.3.  Name some objects around you that are: 
a. a few thousand in number 
b. more than ten thousand in number 
Ans. 
A few thousands: car numbers, 4 digit pin  
More than ten thousands: Salary, Mobile numbers. 
 
Q.3. Roshan wants to buy milk and 3 types of fruit to make fruit custard for 5 people. He 
estimates the cost to be ₹ 100. Do you agree with him? Why or why not? 
Ans. 
Yes, it is possible with less quantity of serving and with purchase of 1-1-1 fruit of each 
type.  
However, it is not possible with costly fruits and more quantity of serving.

Q.8. Recall the sequence of Powers of 2 from Chapter 1, Table 1. Why is the Collatz 
conjecture correct for all the starting numbers in this sequence? 
Ans. 
when we divide 28 = 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2 by 2 it become 27 and every time you divide 
by 2 the same will continue happening, until you are left with 2 which when divided by 
2 will leave 1. 
 
Q.9. Check if the Collatz Conjecture holds for the starting number 100. 
Ans.  100, 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4,
