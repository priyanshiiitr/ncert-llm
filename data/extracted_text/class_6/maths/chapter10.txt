THE OTHER SIDE OF 
ZERO
More and more numbers!
Recall that the very first numbers we learned about in the study of 
mathematics were the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, …  
Then we learned that there are even more numbers! For example, 
there is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before 
1.  The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the 
world. For example, around the world we learn to write numbers in 
the Indian number system using the digits 0 to 9, allowing us to write 
numbers however large or however small using just these 10 digits. 
We then learned about more numbers that exist between the 
numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … , such as 
2 , 
2 , and 13
6 . These are called 
fractions.
But are there still more numbers? Well, 0 is an additional number 
that we didn’t know about earlier, and it comes before 1 and is less 
than 1. Are there perhaps more numbers that come before 0 and are 
less than 0?
Phrased another way, we have seen the number line:
1
3
5
7
9
However, this is actually only a number ‘ray’, in the language we 
learned earlier in geometry; this ray starts at 0 and goes forever to 
the right. Do there exist numbers to the left of 0, so that this number 
ray can be completed to a true number line?
That is what we will investigate in this chapter!

10.1 Bela’s Building of Fun
Children flock to Bela’s ice cream factory to see 
and taste her tasty ice cream. To make it even 
more fun for them, Bela purchased a multi-
storied building and filled it with attractions. 
She named it Bela’s Building of Fun. 
But this was no ordinary building! 
Observe that some of the floors in the 
‘Building of Fun’ are below the ground. What are the shops that you 
find on these floors? What is there on the ground floor?
A lift is used to go up and down between the floors. It has two 
buttons: ‘+’ to go up and ‘–’ to go down. Can you spot the lift?
To go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you 
must press the ‘+’ button twice. 
We say that the button press is + + or + 2.
To go down two floors, you must press the ‘–’ 
button twice, which we write as – – or – 2.
So if you press + 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘+’ 
button once), then you will go up one floor and if 
you press – 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘–’ button 
once), then you will go down 1 floor.
Lift button presses and numbers:
+++ is written as + 3
 – – – – is written as –  4
 What do you press to go four floors up? 
What do you press to go three floors down?

Numbering the floors in the building of fun
Entry to the ‘Building of Fun’ is at the ground floor level and is called 
the ‘Welcome Hall’. Starting from the ground floor, you can reach the 
Food Court by pressing + 1 and can reach the Art Centre by pressing 
+ 2. So, we can say that the Food Court is on Floor + 1 and that the Art 
Centre is on Floor + 2.
Starting from the ground floor, you must press – 1 to reach the Toy 
Store. So, the Toy Store is on Floor – 1 similarly starting from the ground 
floor, you must press – 2 to reach the Video Games shop. So, the Video 
Games shop is on Floor – 2.
The ground floor is called Floor 0. Can you see why?
  Number all the floors in the Building of Fun.
Did you notice that + 3 is the floor number of the Book 
Store, but it is also the number of floors you move 
when you press + 3? Similarly,  – 3 is the floor number 
but it is also the number of floors you go down when 
you press – 3, i.e., when you press – – – .
A number with a ‘+’ sign in front is called a positive 
number. A number with a ‘–’ sign in front is called a 
negative number. 
In the ‘Building of Fun’, the floors are numbered 
using the ground floor, Floor 0, as a reference or starting 
point. The floors above the ground floor are numbered 
with positive numbers. To get to them from the ground 
floor, one must press the ‘+’ button some number of 
times. The floors below the ground are numbered with 
negative numbers. To get to them from the ground floor, 
one must press the ‘–’ button some number of times.
Zero is neither a positive nor a negative number. 
We do not put a ‘+’ or ‘–’ sign in front of it.

Addition to keep track of movement
Start from the Food Court and press + 2 in the lift. Where will you 
reach? ____________
We can describe this using an expression:
Starting Floor + Movement = Target Floor.
The starting floor is + 1 (Food Court) and the number of button 
presses is + 2. Therefore,  you reach the target floor (+ 1) + (+ 2) = + 3 
(Book Store).

On the ground floor, Basant is in a great hurry and by 
mistake he presses +3. What can he do to cancel it and

– 3. That is, (+3) + (– 3) = 0.
We call – 3 the inverse of +3. Similarly, the inverse of 
– 3 is +3.
If Basant now presses +4 and then presses – 4 in the 
lift, where will he reach?

inverse. If you are at Floor +4 and you press its inverse

Subtraction to find which button to press

You may also be familiar with another meaning of subtraction which 
is related to comparison or making quantities equal. For example, 
consider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6.
Now, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my 
sister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ
We can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10   Or   10 – 6 = ?
Here, we see the connection between ‘finding the missing number 
to be added’ and subtraction.
For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use 
this meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing 
number to be added’.
  Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective. 
In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can 
indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction 
shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to 
become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels, 
what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting 
Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) 
or negative (for a decrease).
Teacher’s Note
Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the 
Sports Centre. What should be your button press?
You need to go three floors up, so you should press + 3. We can 
write this as an expression using subtraction: 
Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed.
In the above example, the starting floor is + 2 (Art Centre) and 
the target floor is + 5. The button press to get to + 5 from + 2 is + 3. 
Therefore, 
(+ 5) – (+ 2) = + 3

Explanation 
Recall the connection between addition and subtraction. For 3 + ? = 5, 
we can find the missing number using subtraction: 5 – 3 = 2. That is, 
subtraction is the same as finding the missing number to be added. 
We know that —
Starting Floor + Movement needed = Target Floor
If the movement needed is to be found, then,
Starting Floor + ? = Target Floor
So, 
Target Floor – Starting Floor = ? = Movement needed

Adding and subtracting larger numbers 
The picture shows a mine, a place where 
minerals are extracted by digging into the 
rock. The truck is at the ground level, but 
the minerals are present both above and 
below the ground level. There is a fast 
moving lift which moves up and down in 
a mineshaft carrying people and ore. 
Some of the levels are marked in the 
picture. The ground level is marked 0. 
Levels above the ground are marked by 
positive numbers and levels below the 
ground are marked by negative numbers. 
The number indicates how many metres 
above or below the ground level it is.
In the mine, just like in the Building of Fun:
Starting Level + Movement = Target Level
For example,
(+ 40) + (+ 60) = + 100	 	
(– 90) + (– 55) = – 145
Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed
For example,
(+ 40) – (– 50) = + 90 	
	
(– 90) – (+ 40) = – 130
How many negative numbers are there?
Bela’s Building of Fun had only six floors above and five floors below. 
That is numbers – 5 to + 6. In the mine above, we have numbers from 
– 200 to + 180. But we can imagine larger buildings or mineshafts. 
Just as positive numbers + 1, + 2, + 3, ... keep going up without an end, 
similarly, negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, ... keep going down. Positive 
and negative numbers, with zero, are called integers. They go both 
ways from 0: … – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …

Adding, subtracting, and comparing any numbers 
To add and subtract even larger integers, we can imagine even larger 
lifts! In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards 
and forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even 
have to be any building or mine around — just an ‘infinite lift’! 
We can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like.
For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000 
– (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground 
and 200 below the ground. Recall that,
Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed
To go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we 
must press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after 
that to get to + 2200). Therefore, (+ 2000) – (– 200) = + 2200.  
Notice that (+ 2000) + (+ 200) is also + 2200.

In the above example, we saw that + 2000 – (– 200) = + 2000 + (+ 200) 
= + 2200. In other words, subtracting a negative number is the same 
as adding the corresponding positive number. That is, we can 
replace subtraction of a negative number by addition of a positive 
number!
 In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice 
that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding 
the corresponding positive number?
Take a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you 
of a number line?  In what ways?
Back to the number line
The ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line, 
didn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number 
line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line, 
answering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the 
chapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, … 
Usually we drop the ‘+’ sign on positive numbers and simply write 
them as 1, 2, 3, …

Instead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can

direction, and to the left is the negative (backward) direction. 
Smaller numbers are now to the left of bigger numbers and 
bigger numbers are to the right of smaller numbers. So, 2 < 5; 
– 3 < 2; and – 5 < – 3.

Using the unmarked number line to add and subtract
Just as you can do additions, subtractions and comparisons with small 
numbers using the number line above, you can also do them with 
large numbers by imagining an ‘infinite number line’ or drawing an 
‘unmarked number line’ as follows:
This line shows only the position of zero. Other numbers are not 
marked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to 
add and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale 
of the number line and the positions of numbers on it.
For example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the 
addition problem: 85 + (– 60) = ? 
  
+85
+25
– 60
We then can visualise that 85 + (– 60) = 25
The following UNL shows a subtraction problem which can also be 
written as a missing addend problem: (– 100) – (+ 250) = ? or 250 + ? = – 100. 
+ 250
– 100
?
We can then visualise that ? = –350 in this problem.
In this way, you can carry out addition and subtraction problems, 
with positive and negative numbers, on paper or in your head using an 
unmarked number line.

Converting subtraction to addition and addition to subtraction
Recall that	 Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed 
or
Target Floor = Starting Floor + Movement needed
If we start at 2 and wish to go to – 3, what is the movement needed? 
First method: Looking at the number line, we see we need to 
move – 5 (i.e., 5 in the backward direction). Therefore, – 3 – 2 = – 5. 
The movement needed is –5.
Second method: Break the journey from 2 to –3 into two parts. 
a.	 From 2 to 0, the movement is 0 – 2 = – 2. 
b.	 From 0 to –3, the movement is – 3 – 0 = – 3.
The total movement is the sum of the two movements: – 3 + (– 2) = – 5.
Look at the two coloured expressions. There is no subtraction in 
the second one!
In this way, we can always convert subtraction to addition. The 
number that is being subtracted can be replaced by its inverse 
and then added instead.
Similarly, a number that is being added can be replaced by 
its inverse and then subtracted.  In this way, we can also always 
convert addition to subtraction.

10.2 The Token Model
Using tokens for addition
In Bela’s Building of Fun, the lift attendant is bored. To entertain 
himself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative 
(green) tokens. Each time he presses the ‘+’ button, he takes a 
positive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly, 
each time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and 
puts it in his pocket. 
He starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After 
one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative 
tokens. On which floor is he now? 
He must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2. 
So, he is at Floor + 2 now. 
Here is another way to do the calculation.
A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because 
the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in 
his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively, 
and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative 
token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are 
left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2. 
We can perform any such addition using tokens! 
Example: Add + 5 and – 8.

This is easy to do. From 5 positives 
take away 4 positives to see the result.

(–7) – (–5).
Is (– 7) – (– 5) the same as (– 7) + (+ 5)?
Example: Let us subtract: (+ 5) – (+ 6).

To get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a 
positive and a negative), knowing that this does not change the value 
of the set of tokens.
Now, we can take out 6 positives!

We have to take out 6 negatives from these. But there are not 
enough negatives.
This is not a problem. We add some zero pairs as this does not 
change the value of the set of tokens. 
But how many zero pairs? We have to take away 6 negatives so 
we put down 6 zero pairs:

Credits and debits
Suppose you open a bank account at your local bank with the `100 
that you had been saving over the last month. Your bank balance 
therefore, starts at `100. 
Then you make `60 at your job the next day and you deposit it in 
your account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a ‘credit’. 
 Your new bank balance is _______. 
	
The next day you pay your electric bill of `30 using your bank 
account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a ‘debit’.
 Your bank balance is now ______.
	
The next day you make a major purchase for your business of 
`150. Again this is shown as a debit. 
 What is your bank balance now? ______ 
	
Is this possible?
Yes, some banks do allow your account balance to become negative, 
temporarily! Some banks also charge you an additional amount if 
your balance becomes negative, in the form of ‘interest’ or a ‘fee’.
Your strategic large purchase the previous day allows you to 
make, `200 at your business the next day. 
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
 What is your balance now? ______
You can think of ‘credits’ as positive numbers and ‘debits’ as negative 
numbers. The total of all your credits (positive numbers) and debits 
(negative numbers) is your total bank account balance. This can be 
positive or negative!
In general, it is better to try to keep a positive balance in your 
bank account! 
 Figure it Out
1.	
Suppose you start with `0 in your bank account, and then you 
have credits of `30, `40, and `50, and debits of `40, `50, and `60. 
What is your bank account balance now?
2.	 Suppose you start with `0 in your bank account, and then you have 
debits of `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128, and then a single credit of 
`256. What is your bank account balance now?
3.	
Why is it generally better to try and maintain a positive balance in 
your bank account? What are circumstances under which it may 
be worthwhile to temporarily  have a negative balance?
As you can see, positive and negative numbers along with zero are 
extremely useful in the world of banking and accounting.

10.5 A Pinch of History
Like general fractions, general integers (including zero and the 
negative numbers) were first conceived of and used in Asia, thousands 
of years ago, before they eventually spread across the world in more 
modern times.
The first known instances of the use of negative numbers 
occurred in the context of accounting. In one of China’s most 
important mathematical works, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical 
Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu)—which was completed by the first or second 
century CE—positive and negative numbers were represented using 
red and black rods, much like the way we represented them using 
green and red tokens!
Reprint 2025-26
The Other Side of Zero
There was a strong culture of accountancy also in India in ancient 
times. The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively 
by Kautilya in his Arthaśhāstra (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition 
that an account balance could be negative. The explicit use of negative 
numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient 
Indian works, including in the Bakśhālī manuscript from around the 
year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special 
symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as 
we do today).
The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, 
and zero — all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on 
which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and even division — was given by Brahmagupta in 
his Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave 
clear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers — positive, 
negative, and zero — that essentially formed the modern way of 
understanding these numbers that we still use today!
Some of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of 
positive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below:
Brahmagupta’s Rules for Addition (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta 
18.30, 628 CE)
1.	
The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). 
2.	 The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add 
the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to 
obtain the result (e.g., (– 2) + (– 3) = – 5).
3.	
To add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the 
smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number 
(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to 
obtain the result (e.g., –  5 + 3 = – 2,  2 + (– 3) = – 1 and – 3 + 5 = 2).
4.	 The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0). 
5.	
The sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 
= – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0).
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
Brahmagupta’s Rules for Subtraction (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta 
18.31-18.32)
1.	
If a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result 
is positive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1). 
2.	 If a larger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result 
is negative (e.g., 2– 3 = – 1).
3.	
Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the 
corresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – (– 3) = 2 + 3).
4.	 Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and – 2 – 
(– 2) = 0).
5.	
Subtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2 
– 0 = – 2 and 0 –  0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the 
number’s inverse (e.g., 0 –  (– 2) = 2).
Once you understand Brahmagupta’s rules, you can do addition 
and subtraction with any numbers whatsoever — positive, negative, 
and zero!
 Figure it Out
1.	
Can you explain each of Brahmagupta’s rules in terms of Bela’s 
Building of Fun, or in terms of a number line? 
2.	 Give your own examples of each rule.
Brahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on 
an equal  footing with positive numbers as well as with negative 
numbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic 
operations on all such numbers, positive, negative, and zero—forming 
what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does 
mathematics.
However, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to 
adopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers 
were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab 
world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the 
13th century. 
Reprint 2025-26
The Other Side of Zero
Surprisingly, negative numbers were still not accepted by many 
European mathematicians even in the 18th century. Lazare Carnot, a 
French mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers 
‘absurd’.  But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved 
to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are 
now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with 
and as important as positive numbers — just as Brahmagupta had 
recommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE! 
This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way 
for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about 
in future classes.
Su m m a r y


There are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ‘–’ 
sign in front of them (e.g., – 2), and are called negative numbers. They 
lie to the left of zero on the number line.


The numbers ..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called integers. The 
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers  and the numbers …, 
– 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive 
nor negative.


Every given number has another number associated to it which when 
added to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive 
inverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and 
the additive inverse of – 543 is 543.


Addition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target 
Position.


Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or 
increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement.


Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position – Starting Position 
= Movement.

In general, we can add two numbers by following Brahmagupta’s Rules 
for Addition:
a.	 If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a 
positive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).
b.	 If both numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs), 
and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (– 2 + (– 3) = – 5).
c.	 If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the 
smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number 
(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to 
obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2).
d.	 A number plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0).
e.	 A number plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2).


We can subtract two integers by converting the problem into an addition 
problem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an 
integer is the same as the addition of its additive inverse. 


Integers can be compared: … – 3 < – 2 < – 1 < 0 < +1 < +2 < +3 < ... Smaller 
numbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line.


We can give meaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting 
them as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers 
as distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly, 
negative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground 
level. When measuring temperatures in degrees Celsius, positive 
temperatures are those above the freezing point of water, and negative 
temperatures are those below the freezing point of water.
