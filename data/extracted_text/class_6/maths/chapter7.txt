Recall that when some whole number of things are shared 
equally among some number of people, fractions tell us how 
much each share is.
Shabnam:	 Do you remember, if one roti is divided equally 
between two children, how much 
roti will each child get?
Mukta:	
Each child will get half a roti.
Shabnam:	 The fraction ‘one half’ is written as 
2 . We also sometimes read this as 
‘one upon two.’
Mukta:	
If one roti is equally shared among 
4 children, how much roti will one child get?
Shabnam:	 Each child’s share is 1
4 roti. 
Mukta:	
And which is more 1
2  roti or 1
4  roti? 
Shabnam:	 When 2 children share 1 roti 
equally, each child gets 1
2  roti. When 
4 children share 1 roti equally, each 
child gets 1
4  roti. Since, in the second 
group more children share the

Arvin:

Beni:	
No! That is a common mistake. Think of these fractions 
as shares.
Arvin:	
If one roti is shared among 5 children, each one gets a 
share of 1
5  roti. If one roti is shared among 9 children, 
each one gets a share of 1
9  roti?
Beni:	
Exactly! Now think again - which share is higher?
Arvin:	
If I share with more people, I will get less. So, 1
9 < 1
5.
Beni:	
You got it!
Oh, so 
100  is bigger than 1

called a fractional unit. These are all fractional units: 
2 , 1

Fractions have been used and named in India since ancient times. 
In the Rig Veda, the fraction 3
4  is referred to as tri-pada. This has the 
same meaning as the words for 3
4  in many Indian languages today, 
e.g., ʻteen paavʼ in colloquial Hindi and ‘mukkaal’ in Tamil. Indeed, 
words for fractions used today in many Indian languages go back to 
ancient times.

notice that the lengths of all the blue lines were less than one and 
the lengths of all the black lines were more than 1?

smaller than the denominator, while in the fractions that are more

Expressing a fraction in lowest terms (or in its simplest 
form) 
In any fraction, if its numerator and denominator have no common 
factor except 1, then the fraction is said to be in lowest terms or in 
its simplest form. In other words, a fraction is said to be in lowest 
terms if its numerator and denominator are as small as possible.
	 Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an 
equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small 
as possible. 
Let’s see how to express fractions in lowest terms. 
Example: Is the fraction 16
20 in lowest terms? No, 4 is a common factor 
of 16 and 20. Let us reduce 16
20 to lowest terms. 
We know that both 16 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) are 
divisible by 4. 
So, 16 ÷ 4
20 ÷ 4  = 4
5.     
Now, there is no common factor between 4 and 5. Hence, 16
20 
expressed in lowest terms is 4
5. So, 4
5 is called the simplest form of 16
20, 
since 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1.
Any fraction can be converted to 
lowest terms by dividing both the 
numerator and denominator by the 
highest common factor between 
them. 
Reprint 2025-26
Fractions
Expressing a fraction in lowest terms can also be done in steps. 
Suppose we want to express 36
60 in lowest terms. First, we notice 
that both the numerator and denominator are even. So, we divide 
both by 2, and see that 36
60 =  18
30.
Both the numerator and denominator are even again, so we can 
divide them each by 2 again; we get  18
30 = 9
15. 
We now notice that 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, so we divide 
both by 3 to get  9
15 = 3
5 . 
Now, 3 and 5 have no common factor other than 1, so,  36
60 in lowest 
terms is 3
5.
Alternatively, we could have noticed that in 36
60 , both the numerator 
and denominator are multiples of 12 : we see that 36 = 3 × 12 and 
60 = 5 × 12. Therefore, we could have concluded that  36
60 = 3
5 straight away.
Either method works and will give the same answer! But 
sometimes it can be easier to go in steps.

fractions directly.  However, we know how to find fractions equivalent 
to two fractions with the same denominator. Let us see how we can 
use it:
 4
5  =  4×9
5×9 = 36
45 
 7
9  =  7×5
9×5  = 35
45.
45 is a common multiple 
of 5 and 9, so we can 
use 45 as a common 
denominator.

45 > 35
45

9 and 17
21.
63 is a common multiple of 9 and 21. We can then write:
 7
9 = 7×7
9×7 =  49
63 ,  17
21 = 17×3
21×3 = 51
63.

This method of addition, which works for adding any number of 
fractions, was first explicitly described in general by Brahmagupta 
in the year 628 CE! We will describe the history of the development 
of fractions in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we simply 
summarise the steps in Brahmagupta’s method for addition of 
fractions.
Brahmagupta’s method for adding fractions 
1.	 Find equivalent fractions so that the fractional unit is common 
for all fractions. This can be done by finding a common multiple 
of the denominators (e.g., the product of the denominators, or the 
smallest common multiple of the denominators). 
2.	 Add these equivalent fractions with the same fractional units. 
This can be done by adding the numerators and keeping the same 
denominator. 
3.	 Express the result in lowest terms if needed.
Let us carry out another example of Brahmagupta’s method. 
Example: Find the sum of 2
3 and 1
5.
The denominators of the given fractions are 3 and 5. The lowest 
common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Then we see that
3 = 2 × 5
3 × 5  = 10
15 , 1
5 = 1 × 3
5 × 3  = 3
15 .

Therefore,  2

15  = 13

6  and 1
3.
The smallest common multiple of 6 and 3 is 6. 
6  will remain 1

3 × 2  = 2
6 
Therefore, 1
6  + 1
3  = 1
6  + 2
6  = 3
6.
The fraction 
6  can now be re-expressed in lowest terms, if 
desired. This can be done by dividing both the numerator and 
denominator by 3 (the biggest common factor of 3 and 6):
6  = 3 ÷ 3
6 ÷ 3  = 1

Therefore, 1
6  + 1
3  = 1

7.9 A Pinch of History
Do you know what a fraction was called in ancient India? It was 
called bhinna in Sanskrit, which means ‘broken’. It was also called 
bhaga or ansha meaning ‘part’ or ‘piece’. 
The way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In 
ancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript 
(from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 1
2, they 
wrote it as 1
2 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it 
today! This method of writing and working with fractions continued 
to be used in India for the next several centuries, including by 
Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya 
(c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others. The line 
segment between the numerator and denominator in ‘1
2’ and in other 
Reprint 2025-26
Fractions
fractions was later introduced by the Moroccan mathematician 
Al-Hassar (in the 12th century). Over the next few centuries the 
notation then spread to Europe and around the world.
Fractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient 
Egyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only 
fractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More 
general fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now 
called ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional 
units, e.g., 19
24  = 1
2 + 1
6 + 1
8, can be quite an art and leads to beautiful 
puzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below. 
General fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1) 
were first introduced in India, along with their rules of arithmetic 
operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even 
division of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulba-
sutras’ shows that even during  Vedic times, Indians had discovered 
the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures 
for working with and computing with fractions were first codified 
formally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta. 
Brahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with 
fractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta 
described how to add and subtract fractions as follows:
“By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator 
of each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions 
are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition, 
the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added. 
In case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta, 
Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE)
The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were 
transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and 
they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century 
and then spread worldwide.

to increase at least one of the 1

other 1
3’s to compensate for that increase.  The only way to increase
