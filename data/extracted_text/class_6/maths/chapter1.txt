PATTERNS IN
 MATHEMATICS
1.1 What is Mathematics?
Mathematics is, in large part, the search for patterns, and for 
the explanations as to why those patterns exist.
Such patterns indeed exist all around us — in nature, in 
our homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon, 
and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from 
shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to 
understanding weather patterns and using technology.
The search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun 
and creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians 
think of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, we 
hope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry 
involved in discovering and understanding mathematical 
patterns.
It is important to keep in mind that mathematics 
aims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the 
explanations for why they exist. Such explanations can 
often then be used in applications well beyond the context in 
which they were discovered, which can then help to propel 
humanity forward.

For example, the understanding of patterns in the motion of stars, 
planets, and their satellites led humankind to develop the theory of 
gravitation, allowing us to launch our own satellites and send rockets 
to the Moon and to Mars; similarly, understanding patterns in genomes 
has helped in diagnosing and curing diseases — among thousands of 
other such examples.

How has mathematics helped propel humanity forward? (You 
might think of examples involving: carrying out scientific 
experiments; running our economy and democracy; building 
bridges, houses or other complex structures; making TVs, 
mobile phones, computers, bicycles, trains, cars, planes, 
calendars, clocks, etc.)
1.2 Patterns in Numbers
Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are 
patterns of numbers, particularly patterns of whole numbers:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 
The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in whole 
numbers is called number theory.
Number sequences are the most basic and among the most 
fascinating types of patterns that mathematicians study. 
Table 1 shows some key number sequences that are studied in 
Mathematics.

for forming the numbers in the sequence.
1.3 	Visualising Number Sequences
Many number sequences can be visualised using pictures. Visualising 
mathematical objects through pictures or diagrams can be a very 
fruitful way to understand mathematical patterns and concepts. 
Let us represent the first seven sequences in Table 1 using the 
following pictures.

1.4 Relations among Number Sequences
Sometimes, number sequences can be related to each other in 
surprising ways.
Example: What happens when we start adding up odd numbers?
	
	
	
	
1 = 1
	
	
	
	
1 + 3 = 4
	
	
	
	
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
	
	
	
	
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
	
	
	
	
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
	
	
	
	
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36 
	
	
	
	
	
	
...
This is a really beautiful pattern! 
  Why does this happen? Do you think it will happen forever?
The answer is that the pattern does happen forever. But why? 
As mentioned earlier, the reason why the pattern happens is just as 
important and exciting as the pattern itself.
A picture can explain it
Visualising with a picture can help explain the phenomenon. Recall 
that square numbers are made by counting the number of dots in a 
square grid.
  How can we partition the dots in a square grid into odd 
numbers of dots: 1, 3, 5, 7,... ? 
Think about it for a moment before reading further!

Here is how it can be done:
This picture now makes it evident that 
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36.
Because such a picture can be made for a square of any size, this 
explains why adding up odd numbers gives square numbers.
  By drawing a similar picture, can you say what is the sum of the 
first 10 odd numbers? 
  Now by imagining a similar picture, or by drawing it partially, as 
needed, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers?
Another example of such a relation between sequences: 
Adding up and down
Let us look at the following pattern:
	
	
	
1 = 1
	
	
	
1 + 2 + 1 = 4
	
	
	
1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9
	
	
	
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16
	
	
	
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 25
	
	
	
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36 
This seems to be giving yet another way of getting the square numbers—
by adding the counting numbers up and then down!

1.5 	Patterns in Shapes
Other important and basic patterns that occur in Mathematics 
are patterns of shapes. These shapes may be in one, two, or three 
dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D) — or in even more dimensions.  The 
branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in shapes is called 
geometry.
Shape sequences are one important type of shape pattern that 
mathematicians study. Table 3 shows a few key shape sequences 
that are studied in Mathematics.

1.6 	Relation to Number Sequences
Often, shape sequences are related to number sequences in 
surprising ways. Such relationships can be helpful in studying and 
understanding both the shape sequence and the related number 
sequence.
Example: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular 
Polygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular 
triangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, 
octagon, nonagon, decagon, etc., respectively. 
The word ‘regular’ refers to the fact that these shapes have 
equal-length sides and also equal ‘angles’ (i.e., the sides look the same 
and the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more 
depth in the next chapter. 
The other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful 
relationships with number sequences.
  Figure it Out
1.	 Count the number of sides in each shape in the sequence 
of Regular Polygons. Which number sequence do you get? 
What about the number of corners in each shape in the 
sequence of Regular Polygons? Do you get the same number 
sequence? Can you explain why this happens?
2.	 Count the number of lines in each shape in the sequence 
of Complete Graphs. Which number sequence do you get?

sequence of Stacked Triangles? Which number sequence 
does this give? Can you explain why? (Hint: In each shape in

5.	 To get from one shape to the next shape in the Koch 
Snowflake sequence, one replaces each line segment­ ‘—’ 
by a ‘speed bump’

times, the changes become tinier and tinier with very very 
small line segments. How many total line segments are 
there in each shape of the Koch Snowflake? What is the 
corresponding number sequence? (The answer is 3, 12, 48, ..., 
i.e., 3 times Powers of 4; this sequence is not shown in Table 1.)
