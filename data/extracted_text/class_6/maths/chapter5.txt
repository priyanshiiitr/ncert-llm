Children sit in a circle and play a game of numbers.
One of the children starts by saying ‘1’. The second 
player says ‘2’, and so on. But when it is the turn of 3, 6, 
9, … (multiples of 3), the player should say ‘idli’ instead 
of the number. When it is the turn of 5, 10, … (multiples 
of 5), the player should say ‘vada’ instead of the number. 
When a number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple 
of 5, the player should say ‘idli-vada’! If a player makes 
any mistake, they are out.
The game continues in rounds till only one person 
remains.
For which numbers should the players say ‘idli’ 
instead of saying the number? These would be 3, 6, 9, 
12, 18, … and so on.
For which numbers should the players say ‘vada’? 
These would be 5, 10, 15, 20, … and so on.
Which is the first number for which the players 
should say, ‘idli-vada’? It is 15, which is a multiple of 3, 
and also a multiple of 5. Find out other such numbers 
that are multiples of both 3 and 5. These numbers are

Jump Jackpot
Jumpy and Grumpy play a game.
• 	 Grumpy places a treasure on some number. For example, he 
may place it on 24.
• 	 Jumpy chooses a jump size. If he chooses 4, then he has to 
jump only on multiples of 4, starting at 0.
• 	 Jumpy gets the treasure if he lands on the number where 
Grumpy placed it.
Which jump sizes will get Jumpy to land on 24?
If he chooses 4: Jumpy lands on 4 → 8 → 12 → 16 → 20 → 24 → 28 → ...
Other successful jump sizes are 2, 3, 6, 8 and 12.

The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 all divide 24 exactly. Recall that 
such numbers are called factors or divisors of 24.
Grumpy increases the level of the game. Two treasures are kept 
on two different numbers. Jumpy has to choose a jump size and stick 
to it. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he lands on both the numbers 
with the chosen jump size. As before, Jumpy starts at 0.
Grumpy has kept the treasures on 14 and 36. And, Jumpy chooses 
a jump size of 7.
Will Jumpy land on both the treasures? Starting from 0, he jumps 
to 7 → 14 → 21 → 28 → 35 → 42 … We see that he landed on 14 but

did not land on 36, so he does not get the treasure. What jump size 
should he have chosen?
The factors of 14 are: 1, 2, 7, 14. So, these jump sizes will land on 14.
The factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36. These jump sizes 
will land on 36.
So, the jump sizes of 1 or 2 will land on both 14 and 36. Notice that 
1 and 2 are the common factors of 14 and 36.
The jump sizes using which both the treasures can be reached are 
the common factors of the two numbers where the treasures are

5.2 Prime Numbers
Guna and Anshu want to pack figs (anjeer) that grow in their farm. 
Guna wants to put 12 figs in each box and Anshu wants to put 7 figs 
in each box.
How many arrangements are possible?
Think and find out the different ways how —
	 1.  Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner. 
	 2.  Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner. 
Guna has listed out these possibilities.
Observe the number of rows and 
columns in each of the arrangements. 
How are they related to 12?
In the second arrangement, for 
example, 12 figs are arranged in two 
columns of 6 each or 12 = 2 × 6.
Anshu could make only one 
arrangement: 7 × 1 or 1 × 7. There are 
no other rectangular arrangements 
possible.
In each of Guna’s arrangements, 
multiplying the number of rows by 
the number of columns gives the 
number 12. So, the number of rows 
or columns are factors of 12.
We saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in 
more than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7 
can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors — 1 and 7.
Numbers that have only two factors are called prime numbers or 
primes. Here are the first few primes — 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Notice 
that the factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.
What about numbers that have more than two factors? They 
are called composite numbers. The first few composite numbers 
are — 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20.

What about 1, which has only one factor? The number 1 is neither 
a prime nor a composite number.
	 How many prime numbers are there from 21 to 30? How many 
composite numbers are there from 21 to 30?
Can we list all the prime numbers from 1 to 100?
Here is an interesting way to find prime numbers. Just follow the 
steps given below and see what happens.
Step 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite.
Step 2: Circle 2, and then cross 
out all multiples of 2 after that, 
i.e., 4, 6, 8, and so on.
Step 3: You will find that the 
next uncrossed number is 3. 
Circle 3 and then cross out all 
the multiples of 3 after that, 
i.e., 6, 9, 12, and so on.
Step 4: The next uncrossed 
number is 5. Circle 5 and then 
cross out all the multiples of 5 
after that, i.e., 10, 15, 20, and 
so on.
Step 5: Continue this process till all the numbers in the list are either 
circled or crossed out.
All the circled numbers are prime 
numbers. All the crossed out numbers, 
other than 1, are composite numbers. This 
method is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
This procedure can be carried on 
for numbers greater than 100 also. 
Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician 
who lived around 2200 years ago and 
developed this method of listing primes.

Euclid found the answer and so will you in a later class!

5.3 Co-prime numbers for safekeeping treasures
Which pairs are safe?
Let us go back to the treasure finding game. This time, treasures are 
kept on two numbers. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he is able to 
reach both the numbers with the same jump size. There is also a 
new rule — a jump size of 1 is not allowed.
	 Where should Grumpy place the treasures so that Jumpy cannot 
reach both the treasures?
Will placing the treasure on 12 and 26 work? No! If the jump size 
is chosen to be 2, then Jumpy will reach both 12 and 26.
What about 4 and 9? Jumpy cannot reach both using any jump size 
other than 1. So, Grumpy knows that the pair 4 and 9 is safe.
Check if these pairs are safe:
a. 15 and 39 	
b. 4 and 15 
c. 18 and 29 	
d. 20 and 55

What is special about safe pairs? They don’t have any common 
factor other than 1. Two numbers are said to be co-prime to each 
other if they have no common factor other than 1.
Example: As 15 and 39 have 3 as a common factor, they are not 
co-prime. But 4 and 9 are co-prime.

5.4 Prime Factorisation
Checking if two numbers are co-prime
Teacher:	
Are 56 and 63 co-prime?
Anshu and Guna:	 If they have a common factor other than 1, then 
they are not co-prime. Let us check.
Anshu:	
I can write 56 = 14 × 4 and 63 = 21 × 3. So, 14 and 4 
are factors, of 56. Further, 21 and 3 are factors of 
63. So, there are no common factors. The numbers 
are co-prime.
Guna:	
Hold on. I can also write 56 = 7 × 8 and 63 = 9 × 7. 
We see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they 
are not co-prime.
Clearly Guna is right, as 7 is a common factor. 
 But where did Anshu go wrong? 
Writing 56 = 14 × 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it 
does not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63.
Try another example: 80 and 63. There are many ways to factorise 
both numbers.
80 = 40 × 2 = 20 × 4 = 10 × 8 = 16 × 5 = ???
63 = 9 × 7 = 3 × 21 = ???
We have written ‘???’ to say that there may be more ways to 
factorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations, 
for example, 80 = 16 × 5 and 63 = 9 × 7, then there are no common 
factors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu’s 
mistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other 
ways to factorise the numbers.
What this means is that we need a more systematic approach to 
check if two numbers are co-prime.

Prime factorisation
Take a number such as 56. It is composite, as we saw that it can be 
written as 56 = 4 × 14 . So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one 
of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 × 7. 
Therefore, 56 = 4 × 2 × 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as 
4 = 2 × 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. All the factors appearing here, 2 
and 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further.
In conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers. 
This is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are 
called prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7.
Every number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea 
is the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till 
only primes are left.
The number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not 
divisible by any prime number.
What is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just 
7 (we cannot break it down any further).
Let us see a few more examples.
By going through different ways of breaking down the number, 
we wrote 63 as 3 × 3 × 7 and as 3 × 7 × 3. Are they different? Not 
really! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further, 
3 appears two times in 
both and 7 appears once.
Here, you see four 
different ways to get 
prime factorisation of 36. 
Observe that in all four 
cases, we get two 2s and 
two 3s.
Multiply back to see 
that you get 36 in all four cases.
For any number, it is a remarkable fact that there is only one prime 
factorisation, except that the prime factors may come in different

orders. As we explain below, the order is not important. However, 
as we saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the 
prime factorisation!
Does the order matter? 
Using this diagram,
can you explain why 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, no matter which way you multiply 
2, 3, and 5?
When multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The 
end result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are 
multiplied in any order, we get 36. In a later class, we shall study 
this under the names of commutativity and associativity of 
multiplication. 
Thus, the order does not matter. Usually we write the prime 
numbers in increasing order. For example, 225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 or 30 = 
2 × 3 × 5.
Prime factorisation of a product of two numbers
When we find the prime factorisation of a number, we first write 
it as a product of two factors. For example, 72 = 12 × 6. Then, we 
find the prime factorisation of each of the factors. In the above example, 
12 = 2 × 2 × 3 and 6 = 2 × 3. Now, can you say what the prime factorisation 
of 72 is?
The prime factorisation of the original number is obtained by 
putting these together.
72 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
We can also write this as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3. Multiply and check that 
you get 72 back!
Observe how many times each prime factor occurs in the 
factorisation of 72.
Compare it with how many times it occurs in the factorisations of 
12 and 6 put together.

Prime factorisation is of fundamental importance in the study of 
numbers. Let us discuss two ways in which it can be useful.
Using prime factorisation to check if two numbers are co-prime
Let us again take the numbers 56 and 63. How can we check if they 
are co-prime? We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers —
56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7
Now, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore, 
56 and 63 are not co-prime.
What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows:
80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7
There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they 
are co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite. 
Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in 
the prime factorisation of 80 and 63?
Reprint 2025-26
Prime Time 
Therefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors, 
then the two numbers are co-prime.
Let us see some examples.
Example: Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as 
follows:
40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 231 = 3 × 7 × 11
We see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and 
231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime 
factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime!
Example: Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as 
follows:
242 = 2 × 11 × 11 and 195 = 3 × 5 × 13
The prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195 
are 3, 5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242 
and 195 are co-prime.
Using prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible 
by another
We can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime 
factorisation of the second number is included in the prime 
factorisation of the first number.
We say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12, 
the remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible 
by another without carrying out long division?
Example: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:
168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3
Since we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that,
 168 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 7 = 12 × 14
Therefore, 168 is divisible by 12.
Example: Is 75 divisible by 21? Find the prime factorisations of both:
75 = 3 × 5 × 5 and 21 = 3 × 7
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
As we saw in the discussion above, if 75 was a multiple of 21, then 
all prime factors of 21 would also be prime factors of 75. However, 7 
is a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is 
not divisible by 21.
Example: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:
42 = 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3
All prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime 
factorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42. 
This is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but 
only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not 
divisible by 12.
We can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the 
prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime 
factorisation of the first number.

It is easy to find factors of small numbers. How do we find factors 
of a large number?
Let us take 8560. Does it have any factors from 2 to 10 (2, 3, 4, 
5, ..., 9, 10)?
It is easy to check if some of these numbers are factors or not 
without doing long division. Can you find them?
Divisibility by 10
Let us take 10. Is 8560 divisible by 10? This is another way of 	
asking if 10 is a factor of 8560.
For this, we can look at the pattern in the multiples of 10.
The first few multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, … Continue this 
sequence and observe the pattern.
Is 125 a multiple of 10? Will this number appear in the previous 
sequence? Why or why not?
Can you now answer if 8560 is divisible by 10?
 Consider this statement:
Numbers that are divisible by 10 are those that end with 
‘0’. Do you agree?
Divisibility by 5
The number 5 is another number whose divisibility can easily be 
checked. How do we do it?
Explore by listing down the multiples: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... What do you 
observe about these numbers? Do you see a pattern in the last digit?
What is the largest number less than 399 that is divisible by 5? Is 
8560 divisible by 5? 
 Consider this statement:
Numbers that are divisible by 5 are those that end with 
either a ‘0’ or a ‘5’. Do you agree?
Divisibility by 2
The first few multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, ... 
What do you observe? Do you see a pattern in the last digit?

Numbers that are divisible by 2 are those that end with ‘0’, 
‘2’, ‘4, ‘6’ or ‘8’. Do you agree?
What are all the multiples of 2 between 399 and 411?
Divisibility by 4
Checking if a number is divisible by 4 can also be done easily!
Look at its multiples: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, …
Are you able to observe any patterns that can be used? The 
multiples of 10, 5 and 2 have a pattern in their last digits which we 
are able to use to check for divisibility. Similarly, can we check if a 
number is divisible by 4 by looking at the last digit?
It does not work! Look at 12 and 22. They have the same last digit, 
but 12 is a multiple of 4 while 22 is not. Similarly 14 and 24 have the 
same last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16 
and 26 or 18 and 28. What this means is that by looking at the last 
digit, we cannot tell whether a number is a multiple of 4.
Can we answer the question by looking at more digits? Make a list 
of multiples of 4 between 1 and 200 and search for a pattern.
  Find numbers between 330 and 340 that are divisible by 4. Also, 
find numbers between 1730 and 1740, and 2030 and 2040, that are 
divisible by 4. What do you observe?
  Is 8536 divisible by 4?
 Consider these statements:
1.	 Only the last two digits matter when deciding if a given 
number is divisible by 4.
2. If the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4, 
then the original number is divisible by 4.
3. If the original number is divisible by 4, then the number 
formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4.

Interestingly, even checking for divisibility by 8 can be simplified. 
Can the last two digits be used for this?
 Find numbers between 120 and 140 that are divisible by 8. Also 
find numbers between 1120 and 1140, and 3120 and 3140, that are 
divisible by 8. What do you observe?
 Change the last two digits of 8560 so that the resulting number is 
a multiple of 8.
 Consider these statements:
1.	 Only the last three digits matter when deciding if a 
given number is divisible by 8.
2.	 If the number formed by the last three digits is divisible 
by 8, then the original number is divisible by 8.
3.	 If the original number is divisible by 8, then the number 
formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8.
Do you agree? Why or why not?
We have seen that long division is not always needed to check if a 
number is a factor or not. We have made use of certain observations 
to come up with simple methods for 10, 5, 2, 4, 8. Do we have such 
simple methods for other numbers as well? We will discuss simple 
methods to test divisibility by 3, 6, 7, and 9 in later classes!

If a number is divisible by another, the second number is called a factor 
of the first. For example, 4 is a factor of 12 because 12 is divisible by 4 
(12 ÷ 4 = 3).


Prime numbers are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … that have only two 
factors, namely 1 and themselves.


Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, … that have more 
than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For 
example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both 
composite.


Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime 
numbers. This is called the number’s prime factorisation. For example, 
84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.


There is only one way to factorise a number into primes, except for 
the ordering of the factors.


Two numbers that do not have a common factor other than 1 are said 
to be co-prime.


To check if two numbers are co-prime, we can first find their prime 
factorisations and check if there is a common prime factor. If there is no 
common prime factor, they are co-prime, and otherwise they are not.


A number is a factor of another number if the prime factorisation of 
the first number is included in the prime factorisation of the second 
number.
