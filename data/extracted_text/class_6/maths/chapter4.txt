If you ask your classmates about their favourite colours, you will 
get a list of colours. This list is an example of data. Similarly, if you 
measure the weight of each student in your class, you would get a 
collection of measures of weight—again data. 
	
Any collection of facts, numbers, measures, observations or other 
descriptions of things that convey information about those things is 
called data.
	
We live in an age of information. We constantly see large amounts 
of data presented to us in new and interesting ways. In this chapter, 
we will explore some of the ways that data is presented, and how we 
can use some of those ways to correctly display, interpret and make 
inferences from such data!
4.1 Collecting and Organising Data
Navya and Naresh are discussing their favourite games.
Cricket is my 
favourite game! 
I play cricket sometimes 
but hockey is the game I 
like the most. 
I think cricket is the 
most popular game in 
our class.
I am not sure. How can we find 
the most popular game in our 
class?

To figure out the most popular game in 
their class, what should Navya and Naresh 
do? Can you help them?
 Naresh and Navya decided to go to each student in the class and 
ask what their favourite game is. Then they prepared a list.
	
Navya is showing the list:
	
She says (happily), “I have collected the data. I can figure out the 
most popular game now!”.
	
A few other children are looking at the list and wondering, “We 
can’t yet see the most popular game. How can we get it from this list?”.

without writing any numbers. Look at this picture — you may be 
familiar with it from previous classes.

A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps 
answer questions about data with just a quick glance. 
	
In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol ( ) is used to represent 
one student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or 
symbol stands for many people or objects.
 Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of 
his middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least 
9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data:
Response
Number of Children (
 = 10 Children)
Always
  
  
  
  
Sometimes
  
  
Never
  
  
  
 
Answer the following questions using the pictograph:
1.	
What is the number of children who always slept at least 9 
hours at night?  
2.	
How many children sometimes slept at least 9 hours at night?
3.	
How many children always slept less than 9 hours each night? 
Explain how you got your answer.
Solutions 
1.	
 In the table, there are 5 pictures 
 for ‘Always’. Each picture 
 represents 10 children. Therefore, 5 pictures indicate 
5 × 10 = 50 children.
2.	
There are 2 complete pictures 
 (2 × 10 = 20) and a half 
picture
 (half of 10 = 5). Therefore, the number of children 
who sleep at least 9 hours only sometimes is 20 + 5 = 25.
Reprint 2025-26
Data Handling and Presentation
3.	
There are 4 complete pictures for ‘Never’. Hence, 4 × 10 = 
40 children never sleep at least 9 hours in a night, i.e., they 
always sleep less than 9 hours.

  What could be the problems faced in preparing such a 
pictograph, if the total number of students present in a 
class is 33 or 27?
••
Pictographs are a nice visual and suggestive way to represent 
data. They represent data through pictures of objects. 
••
Pictographs can help answer questions and make inferences 
about data with just a quick glance (in the examples above— 
about favourite games, favourite colours, most common modes 
of conveyance, number of students absent, etc.). 
••
By reading a pictograph, we can quickly understand the 
frequencies of the different categories (for example, cricket, 
hockey, etc.) and the comparisons of these frequencies.
••
In a pictograph, the categories can be arranged horizontlly or 
vertically. For each category, simple pictures and symbols are 
then drawn in the designated columns or rows according to the 
frequency of that category. 
••
A scale or key (for example, 
 : 1 student or 
 : 5 students) 
is added to show what each symbol or picture represents. Each 
symbol or picture can represent one unit or multiple units.
••
It can be more challenging to prepare a pictograph when the 
amount of data is large or when the frequencies are not exact 
multiples of the scale or key.

Like pictographs, such 
bar graphs can help us to 
quickly understand and 
interpret 
information, 
such as the highest value, 
the comparison of values 
of different categories, etc. 
However, when the amount 
of data is large, presenting 
it by a pictograph is not 
only time consuming but 
at times difficult too. Let us 
see how data can be presented instead using a bar graph.

Teacher’s Note 
 Answer the following questions using the bar graph:
1.	
In Class 2, ___________ students were absent that day.

In which class were the maximum number of students absent?

When making bar graphs, bars of uniform width can be drawn 
horizontally or vertically with equal spacing between them; then the 
Reprint 2025-26
Data Handling and Presentation
length or height of each bar represents the given number. As we saw in 
pictographs, we can use a scale or key when the frequencies are larger. 
	
Let us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing 
in Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day. 
The number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from 
6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph. One unit of length 
stands for 100 vehicles.
600

1200
Time intervals
Number of vehicles
11–12
10–11
9–10
8–9
7–8

We can see that the maximum traffic at the crossing is shown 
by the longest bar, i.e., for the time interval 7–8 a.m. The bar graph 
shows that 1200 vehicles passed through the crossing at that time. 
The second longest bar is for 8–9 a.m. During that time, 1000 vehicles 
passed through the crossing. Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown 
by the smallest bar, i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During 
that time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The 
second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon, 
when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing.
	
The total number of cars passing through the crossing during the 
two-hour interval 8.00–10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about 
1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles.

3.	 Why do you think the traffic was the heaviest between 7–8 a.m.?
4.	 Why do you think the traffic was lesser and lesser each hour after 
8 a.m. all the way until noon?

period of 50 years. The numbers are expressed in crores. If you were 
to take 1 unit length to represent one person, drawing the bars will

be difficult! Therefore, we choose the scale so that 1 unit represents 
10 crores. The bar graph for this choice is shown in the figure. So a 
bar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents 
80 crores.
••
On the basis of this bar graph, what may be a few questions you 
may ask your friends?
••
How much did the population of India increase over 50 years? 
How much did the population increase in each decade?
4.4 Drawing a Bar Graph
In a previous example, Shri Nilesh prepared a frequency table 
representing the sweet preferences of the students in his class. Let’s 
try to prepare a bar graph to present his data —
1.	
First, we draw a horizontal 
line and a vertical line. On 
the horizontal line, we will 
write the name of each of 
the sweets, equally spaced, 
from which the bars will 
rise in accordance with 
their frequencies; and on 
the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the 
number of students. 
2.	
We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many 
students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that 
it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to 
represent 1 student. 
3.	
For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 
units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly 
for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their 
frequencies. 
Sweet
No. of Students
Jalebi
Gulab jamun
Gujiya
Barfi 
Rasgulla
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

We, therefore, get a bar graph as shown below —

Jalebi
Gulab jamun
Gujia 
Barfi
Rasgulla
	
When the frequencies are larger and we cannot use the scale of 
1 unit length = 1 number (frequency), we need to choose a different 
scale like we did in the case of pictographs. 
Example: The number of runs scored by Smriti in each of the 
8 matches are given in the table below:
Match
Match 
Match 
Match 
Match 
Match 
Match 
Match 
Match 
Runs
50
100
0

In this example, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score 
is 100. Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we 
have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would 
be unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit 
length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw 
the bars according to the scores in each match. We get the following 
bar graph representing the above data.

To represent this data in the form of a bar graph, here are the steps —
••
Draw two perpendicular lines, one horizontal and one vertical. 
••
Along the horizontal line, mark the ‘items’ with equal spacing 
between them and mark the corresponding expenditures along 
the vertical line.
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
••
Take bars of the same width, keeping a uniform gap between them. 
••
Choose a suitable scale along the vertical line. Let, 1 unit length = 
` 200, and then mark and write the corresponding values (` 200, 
` 400, etc.) representing each unit length.
	
Finally, calculate the heights of the bars for various items as 
shown below — 
House rent
Food
Education

3000 ÷ 200

Like pictographs, bar graphs give a nice visual way to represent 
data. They represent data through equally-spaced bars, each of 
equal width, where the lengths or heights give frequencies of the 
different categories. 
•	
Each category is represented by a bar where the length or height 
depicts the corresponding frequency (for example, cost) or 
quantity (for example, runs). 
•	
The bars have uniform spaces between them to indicate that they 
are free standing and represent equal categories.
•	
The bars help in interpreting data much faster than a frequency 
table. By reading a bar graph, we can compare frequencies of 
different categories at a glance.
•	
We must decide the scale (for example,  1 unit length = 1 student 
or 1 unit length = ` 200) for a bar graph on the basis of the data 
including the minimum and maximum frequencies, so that the 
resulting bar graph fits nicely and looks visually appealing on the 
paper or poster we are preparing. The markings of the unit lengths 
as per the scale must start from zero.
Teacher’s Note 
The main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find 
answers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to 
take specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing 
practice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data.

4.5 Artistic and Aesthetic Considerations
In addition to the steps described in previous sections, there are 
also some other more artistic and aesthetic aspects one can consider 
when preparing visual presentations of data to make them more 
interesting and effective. First, when making a visual presentation 
of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make 
it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by 
choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also 
desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and 
easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the 
information being conveyed.
	
Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest 
mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain 
in meters.

How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are 
Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This 
is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers.
	
As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers 
into a bar graph, as shown on the right.  Here, each value is drawn 
as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the 
number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights 
of all these mountains at a glance.

However, since the boxes represent heights, it is better and more 
visually appealing to rotate the picture, so that the boxes grow 
upward, vertically from the ground like mountains. A bar graph 
with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the 
pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof. 
	
Below is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains. From 
this column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the 
heights of the mountains.

In general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing 
to represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground, 
using bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly, 
lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances 
between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar 
graphs with horizontal arcs.

If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the 
tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph 
with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?
2.	
If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent 
and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with 
vertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this 
information, and then make the corresponding table and bar 
graph! Which continents have the longest rivers?
Infographics
When data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified 
with more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called 
information graphics or infographics for short.  The aim of 
infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging 
visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, 
in a visually pleasing way. 
	
As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate 
data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing 
the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with 
vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more 
indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use 
triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a 
splash of colour as well. Here is the result.

While this infographic might look more appealing and suggestive at 
first glance, it does have some issues. The goal of our bar graph earlier 
was to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the 
appropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the 
same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights. 
However, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are 
taller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional 
information that may be misleading and may or may not be correct. 
Sometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally 
mislead.
	
Taking this idea further, and to make the picture even more visually 
stimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the 
mountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add 
other details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example, 
we can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these 
mountains.
	
Is the infographic below better than the column graph with 
rectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more 
realistic, but is the picture accurate? 
	
For example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus.

While preparing visually-appealing presentations of data, we 
also need to be careful that the pictures we draw do not mislead us 
about the facts. In general, it is important to be careful when making 
or reading infographics, so that we do not mislead our intended 
audiences and we, ourselves, are not misled.

Pictographs represent data in the form of pictures, or objects or parts 
of objects. Each picture represents a frequency which can be 1 or more 
than 1 — this is called the scale and it must be specified. 


Bar graphs have bars of uniform width; the length or height that 
indicates the total frequency of occurrence. The scale that is used to 
convert length or height to frequency again, must be specified. 


Choosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is 
important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information 
or data and to also make it visually appealing.


Other aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual 
appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures 
are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These 
aspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling 
and presentation. 


However, making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also 
sometimes be misleading.


By reading pictographs and bar graphs accurately, we can quickly

Q.11. The number of tigers in India went down drastically between 1900 and 1970. 
Project Tiger was launched in 1973 to track and protect tigers in India. Starting 
in 2006, the exact number of tigers in India was tracked. Shagufta and Divya 
looked up information about the number of tigers in India between 2006 and 2022 
in 4-year intervals. They prepared a frequency table for this data and a bar graph 
to present this data, but there are a few mistakes in the graph. Can you find those 
mistakes and fix them? 
Ans. 
There are mistakes in the bars of 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018.

Figure it out  
Q.1.  If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the tallest persons in 
each class in your school, would you use a graph with vertical bars or horizontal 
bars? Why? 
Ans. 
To present the data of the heights of the tallest persons in each class in a school, vertical 
bar graph is useful as heights of persons can be compared by heights of bars easily. 
(Although both bar graphs can be used.) (Think of more reasons!) 
Q.2.  If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent and their 
lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with vertical bars or with horizontal 
bars? Why? Try finding out this information, and then make the corresponding 
table and bar graph! Which continents have the longest rivers? 
Ans. 
In this case, bar graph with horizontal bars is useful as length of a river is a horizontal 
feature, so lengths of rivers can be compared with lengths of horizontal bars easily. 
(Although both bar graphs can be used.) (can you think of any other reasons?)
