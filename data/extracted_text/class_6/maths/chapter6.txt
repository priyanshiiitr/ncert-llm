6.1  Perimeter
Do you remember what the perimeter of a closed plane figure is? 
Let us refresh our understanding! 
	
The perimeter of any closed plane figure is the distance covered 
along its boundary when you go around it once. For a polygon, i.e., 
a closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is 
simply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance 
along its outer boundary.
	
The perimeter of a polygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides.
	
Let us revise the formulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares, 
and triangles.
Perimeter of a rectangle
Consider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and 
8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter? 
Perimeter of the rectangle = Sum of the lengths of its four sides
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
= AB + BC + CD + DA

= AB + BC + AB + BC 
	
	
	
	
= 2 × AB + 2 × BC
	
	
	
	
= 2 × (AB + BC) 
	
	
	
	
= 2 × (12 cm + 8 cm)  
	
	
	
	
= 2 × (20 cm) 
	
	
	
	
= 40 cm.
From this example, we see that —
Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth.
Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth).
The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth.
Perimeter of a square 
Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around 
a square photo frame of side 1m as shown. 
What will be the length of the coloured tape 
he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the 
coloured tape all around the square photo 
frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the 
photo frame. 
	
Thus, the length of the tape required = 
perimeter of the square 
	
= sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square 
	
= 1 m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m.
	
Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length. 
Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply 
multiply the length of one side by 4. 
	
Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m. 
	
From this example, we see that
Perimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side.
	
The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side.
Opposite sides of a 
rectangle are always 
equal. So, AB = CD and 
AD = BC

Perimeter of a triangle
Consider a triangle having three given sides of  
lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 7 cm. Find its perimeter. 
Perimeter of the triangle = 4 cm + 5 cm + 7 cm
	
	
	
	
	
	
   = 16 cm.
Perimeter of a triangle = sum of the lengths of its three sides.	
Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a 
rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m 
wide. Find the length of the lace required.
Solution
	
	 Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m.
	
	 Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m.
	
	 Akshi wants to put lace all around the 
tablecloth. 
	
	 Therefore, the length of the lace required will be the perimeter of the 
rectangular tablecloth.
	
	 Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth	= 2 × (length + breadth) 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
= 2 × (3 m + 2 m) 
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
= 2 × 5 m = 10 m.
	
	 Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m.
Example: Find the distance travelled by Usha if she takes three rounds of 
a square park of side 75 m.
Solution
	
	 Perimeter of the square park = 4 × length 
of a side = 4 × 75 m = 300 m.
	
	 Distance covered by Usha in one  
round = 300 m. 
	
	 Therefore, the total distance travelled by 
Usha in three rounds = 3 × 300 m = 900 m.

This figure has lines of two different unit lengths. Measure the 
lengths of a red line and a blue line; are they same? We will call the 
red lines — straight lines and the blue lines — diagonal lines. So, the 
perimeter of this triangle is 6 straight units + 3 diagonal units. We 
can write this in a short form as: 6s + 3d units.
 Write the perimeters of the figures below in terms of straight and

Perimeter of a regular polygon
Like squares, closed figures that have all sides and all angles equal 
are called regular polygons. We studied the sequence of regular 
polygons as ‘Shape Sequence’ #1 in Chapter 1. Examples of regular 
polygons are the equilateral triangle (where all three sides and all 
three angles are equal), regular pentagon (where all five sides and 
all five angles are equal), etc.
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle
We know that for any triangle its perimeter 
is sum of all three sides. 
 
Using this understanding, we can find the 
perimeter of an equilateral triangle. 
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle  
= AB + BC + AC = AB + AB + AB
= 3 times length of one side. 
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = 3 × length of a side.

6.2  Area
We have studied the areas of closed figures (regular and irregular) 
in previous grades. Let us recall some key points.
The amount of region enclosed by a closed figure is called its area.
	
In previous grades, we arrived at the formula for the area of a 
rectangle and a square using square grid paper. Do you remember?
Area of a square =  ________
 Area of a rectangle =  _______
Teacher’s Note 
Help students in recalling the method of finding the area of a 
rectangle and a square using grid papers. Provide square grid 
papers to students and let them come up with the formula.
	
Let’s see some real-life problems related to these ideas.
Example: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m 
is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted.
Solution
Length of the floor = 5 m.
Width of the floor = 4 m.
Area of the floor = length × width = 5 m × 4 m = 20 sq m.
Length of the square carpet = 3 m.
Area of the carpet = length × length = 3 m × 3 m = 9 sq m.
Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m.
	
Therefore, the area of the floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor 
minus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sq m – 9 sq m = 11 sq m.
Example: Four square flower beds each of side 4 m are in four corners 
on a piece of land 12 m long and 10 m wide. Find the area of the remaining 
part of the land. 
Reprint 2025-26
Ganita Prakash | Grade 6
Solution
Length of the land (l) = 12 m.
Width of land (w) = 10 m.
Area of the whole land = l × w = 12 m × 10 m = 120 sq m.
The sidelength of each of the four square flower beds is (s) = 4 m.
Area of one flower bed = s × s = 4 m × 4 m = 16 sq m.
Hence, the area of the four flower beds = 4 × 16 sq m = 64 sq m.
	
Therefore, the area of the remaining part of the land is: area of the complete 
land minus the area of all four flower beds = 120 sq m – 64 sq m = 56 sq m.

The area of a rectangle is its length times its width. The area of a square 
is the length of any one of its sides multiplied by itself.


Two closed figures can have the same area with different perimeters, 
or the same perimeter with different areas. 


Areas of regions can be estimated (or even determined exactly) by 
breaking up such regions into unit squares, or into more general-
shaped rectangles and triangles whose areas can be calculated.

  Q. Akshi says that the perimeter of this triangle shape is 9 units. Toshi says it can’t 
be 9 units and the perimeter will be more than 9 units. What do you think? 
Ans. The perimeter will be more than 9 units as the length of a diagonal of a square is always 
greater than the sides of the square.

Q. Now, find out the missing dimensions and area of Sharan’s home. Below is the plan: 
Some of the measurements are given. 
a. Find the missing measurements. 
b. Find out the area of his house. 
What are the dimensions of all the different rooms in Sharan’s house? Compare the 
areas and perimeters of Sharan’s house and Charan’s house. 
Ans.  a. Dimensions of Sharan’s house. 
i. 
Utility 7ft × 10 ft 
Area = 70 sq ft 
 
ii. 
Hall 23ft × 15 ft 
Area = 345 sq ft 
iii. 
Entrance 7 ft × 15ft 
Area = 105 sq ft 
 
iv. 
Small bedroom 12ft × 10ft 
Area = 120 sq ft 
 
v. 
Toilet 5ft × 10 ft 
[6] 
 
Area = 50 sq ft 
 
b. Area of his house = 42 ft × 25 ft  
 = 1050 sq ft 
 
Area of Charan’s house = 35ft × 30 ft = 1050 sq ft 
Area of Sharan’s house = 42 ft × 25ft = 1050 sq ft 
Area of both the houses are equal.  
Now, Perimeter of Charan’s house = 130 ft 
Perimeter of Sharan’s house = 134 ft 
Perimeter of Sharan’s house is greater than the Perimeter of Charan’s house.
