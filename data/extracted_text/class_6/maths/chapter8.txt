Now, arm yourself with a ruler and a compass. Let us explore if 
we can draw these figures with these tools and get familiar with a 
compass.
Observe the way a compass is made. What can one draw with the 
compass? Explore!
Do you know what curves are? They are any shapes that can be 
drawn on paper with a pencil, and include straight lines, circles and 
other figures as shown below:
Mark a point ‘P’ in your notebook. Then, mark as many points as 
possible, in different directions, that are 4 cm away from P. 
	
Think: Imagine marking all the points of 4 cm distance from the 
point P. How would they look? 
	
Try to draw it and verify if it is correct by taking some points on 
the curve and checking if their distances from P are indeed 4 cm.
Explore, if you have not already done so, 
and see if a compass can be used for this 
purpose.
You can start by marking a few points 
of distance 4 cm from P using the compass. 
How can this be done?

You will have to open up the compass against a ruler (see Fig. 8.2) 
such that the distance between the tip of the compass and the pencil 
is 4 cm. 
	
Now, try to get the full curve. 
Hint: Keep the point of the compass fixed moving only the pencil.
What is the shape of the curve? It is a circle!
Take a point on the circle. What will be its distance from P—equal 
to 4 cm, less than 4 cm or greater than 4 cm? Similarly, what will be 
the distance between P and another point on the circle?
As shown in the figure, the point P is called the centre of the circle 
and the distance between the centre and any point on the circle is 
called the radius of the circle.

What shapes are these? Yes, these are our familiar squares and 
rectangles. But what makes them squares and rectangles?
Consider this rectangle ABCD.
The points A, B, C and D are the corners 
of the rectangle. Lines AB, BC, CD and DA 
are its sides. Its angles are ∠A, ∠B, ∠C

opposite sides, as they lie opposite to 
each other. Likewise, AD and BC is the 
other pair of opposite sides.

a square in the same manner.
A square satisfies the following two properties:
S1)	 All the sides are equal, and
S2)	 All the angles are 90

See the rectangle in Fig. 8.4 and the name given to it: ABCD. This 
rectangle can also be named in other ways — BCDA, CDAB, DABC, 
ADCB, DCBA, CBAD and BADC. So, can a rectangle be named using 
any combination of the labels around its corners? No! For example, 
it cannot be named ABDC or ACBD. Can you see what names are 
allowed and what names are not?

the rectangle, starting from any corner.

 At which positions will the points X and Y be at their closest? 
When do you think they will be the farthest? What does your 
intuition say? Discuss with your classmates.
Now, verify your guesses by placing the points X and Y on the 
sides and measure how near or far they are.
The distance between X and Y can be obtained by measuring the 
length of the line XY.
How does the minimum distance between the points X and Y 
compare to the length of AB?
Change the positions of X and Y to check if there are other 
positions where they are at their nearest or farthest. You could 
construct multiple copies of the rectangle and try out various 
positions of X and Y.
How will you keep track of the lengths XY for different positions 
of X and Y?
Here is one way of doing it. Suppose here are some of the positions 
of X and Y that you have considered:
•	
When X is 5 mm away from A and Y is 3 cm away from B,  
XY = ___ cm __ mm
•	
When X is 1 cm away from A and Y is 1 cm away from B,  
XY = ___ cm ___ mm
•	
When X is 2 cm away from A and Y is 4 cm away from B,  
XY = ___ cm ___ mm and so on.
  Is there a shorthand way of writing it down? In all the sentences, 
only the position of X, Y and the length XY changes. So we could 
write this as:
Distance of X from A
Distance of Y from B

What can we infer from this figure?
	
Can you identify the equal sides?
	
Since, the two squares are identical, 
	
AB = BC and FE = ED
	
Since ABEF and BCDE are squares, all the sides in each of the 
squares are equal. This is written as —
	
AF = AB = BE = FE
	
BE = BC = CD = ED
	
So, all the shorter lines are equal!
	
A convention is followed to represent equal sides. It is done by 
putting a ‘|’ on the line. Refer to the rough figure.
	
Using this analysis, can you try constructing it? Remember, all 
that was asked for is a rectangle that can be divided into two 
identical squares and with no measurements imposed.
	
To draw the rectangle ACDF, one could assign any length to AF. For 
example, if we assign AF = 4 cm, then what must the length of AC be?
	
 Explore: Can the rectangle now be completed?
	
In fact, one could proceed by drawing AF without even 
measuring its length using a ruler. We could then construct a 
line perpendicular to AF that is long enough to contain the other 
side. As, AB = AF, we need to somehow transfer the length of AF

In rectangle PQRS, the right angles at P and R are referred to as 
opposite angles. The other pair of opposite angles are the right 
angles at Q and S.
Observe that a diagonal divides each of the pair of opposite 
angles into two smaller angles. In the figure, the diagonal PR divides 
angle R into two smaller angles which we simply call g and h. The 
diagonal also divides angle P into c and d. Are g and h equal? Are 
c and d equal?

eye. Note that the upper curve and the lower curve should together form 
a symmetrical figure. For this to happen, where should these points A and 
B be placed? Make a good estimate.

Try to get the eyes as symmetrical and identical as possible. This might 
need many trials.

For the purpose of construction, let us take the side lengths to be of 5 cm. 
Consider this figure.

We need to identify only one more point to make this a 4-sided 
figure. That point, let us call it D, should be 5 cm from both B and C. 
How can such a point be found?
Can any of the ideas used in the ‘House’ problem be used here?

Q.1. What radius should be taken in the compass to get this half circle? What should be 
the length of AX? 
Ans. 2 cm. AX = 4 cm.  
 
Q.2. Take a central line of a different length and try to draw the wave on it.  
Ans. 
 
 
Q.3. Try to recreate the figure where the waves are smaller than a half circle (as 
appearing in the neck of the figure ‘A Person’). The challenge here is to get both the 
waves to be identical. This may be tricky!

Figure it out 
Draw a rectangle & then leave one dot distance diagonally to place the four smaller squares.  
Q.2. Identify if there are any squares in this collection. Use measurements if needed. 
Ans. A is a square. 
 
  Think: Is it possible to reason out if the sides are equal or not, and if the angles are 
right or not without using any measuring instruments in the above figure? Can we 
do this by only looking at the position of corners in the dot grid? 
Ans. Yes, In the above figure without measuring one can reason out for equal sides & right 
angles.  
Yes, the position of the points on the grid paper makes it possible  
Q.3. Draw at least 3 rotated squares and rectangles on a dot grid. Draw them such that 
their corners are on the dots. Verify if the squares and rectangles that you have 
drawn satisfy their respective properties.
