Chapter
Reshma lives in a coastal town of 
Kerala and is very fond of writing 
short stories. Her grandmother 
loves listening to her stories, so 
Reshma was writing a new story 
to share with her grandmother 
on her 60th birthday. 
Exploring Magnets
The story was based on a ship 
carrying spices from Kerala for 
trade in the olden days. Reshma 
was aware that in those days, 
the sailors used stars to find 
directions at night. But in her 
story, a situation arose wherein 
the sailors got caught in a storm 
with an overcast sky and stars 
were not visible. Reshma could not take her story forward 
as she could not think of a way for sailors to find directions. 
She searched for information on the internet and her 
school library. She learnt that the travellers used a device, 
known as a magnetic compass, for finding 
directions.  
Reshma had seen pencil boxes and 
purses which had magnets to keep them 
closed. A writing board in her school 
also had a duster with a magnet. But 
she had never looked at those carefully. 
She now became curious to learn more 
about magnets and magnetic compasses.

The magnets used by sailors in the olden days were based 
on naturally occurring magnets, known as lodestones which 
were discovered in ancient times. Later on, people found 
out that magnets could also be made from pieces of iron. 
Nowadays, we have magnets made of different materials. 
The magnets that you find in your school laboratory and 
those used in pencil boxes, stickers, toys are all artificial 
magnets (Fig. 4.1). The magnets can be of various shapes, 
some of which are shown in Fig. 4.2.

Was your prediction correct for all objects? Which 
materials stuck to the magnet? What conclusion can you 
draw?
Through this activity, we found out that some of the 
objects were attracted to the magnet and stuck to it, while 
others were not. The materials which are attracted towards 
a magnet are called magnetic materials. 
The metal iron is a magnetic material. 
Nickel and cobalt are other metals that are 
also magnetic. Some of their combinations 
with other metals are also attracted 
towards magnets. The materials which are 
not attracted towards a magnet are called 
non-magnetic materials. 
Which materials listed in Table 4.1 were 
found to be non-magnetic?

Activity 4.2: Let us investigate


Spread some iron filings (very small pieces of iron) on a 
sheet of paper. 


Place a bar magnet over them. Tap the paper and 
observe carefully what happens to the iron filings. 
Do you observe anything special about the way they stick 
to the magnet? Do the iron filings stick all over the magnet 
uniformly? Or do the iron filings stick more at some places? 
We find that maximum iron filings stick near the ends of 
the bar magnet, as shown in Fig. 4.4, while a very few iron 
filings stick at the remaining part of the magnet.

to a bar magnet

If we have noticed the direction 
where the Sun rises or sets, we 
have an approximate idea of 
where East or West is. Hence, we 
can locate the direction along 
which the magnet rests.
These ends of the magnet are called the 
two poles of the magnet—the North pole and 
the South pole. Most of the iron filings stick 
to the poles of a magnet of any shape. 
It is not possible to obtain a magnet with 
a single pole. If a magnet is broken into 
smaller pieces, North and South poles always 
exist in pairs even in the smallest piece of the magnet. 
A single North pole or a South pole cannot exist.
4.3 Finding Directions
Activity 4.3: Let us experiment


Suspend a bar magnet with a thread tied to the middle of 
the magnet as shown in Fig. 4.5. You may need to adjust 
the position of the string till the magnet is balanced 
horizontally.


Now rotate the magnet gently in the 
horizontal direction and let it come to rest. 


Mark the position corresponding to the 
ends of the magnet on the ground (or on 
a piece of paper stuck to the ground). Join 
these two points on the ground with a 
line. This line indicates the direction along 
which the magnet comes to rest. 


Now again rotate the magnet by giving a 
gentle push at its one end and wait till it 
comes to rest. Does the magnet rest along 
the same line?
Fig. 4.5: A freely suspended 
bar magnet
Can we find 
a magnet 
with a 
single pole? ?
What direction does 
this line indicate 
along which the 
magnet rests? How 
can we find it out?
Exploring Magnets
Reprint 2025-26
A freely suspended magnet comes to rest along the 
north-south direction. The end of the magnet that points 
towards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or 
the North pole of the magnet. The other end that points 
towards the South direction is called the South-seeking 
pole or the South pole of the magnet. A freely suspended 
magnet rests along the north-south direction because our 
Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet.
Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of 
the bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest 
along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along 
any direction. This implies that only magnets rest along 
north-south direction. This activity provides us with a way 
to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. 
The property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest 
along the north-south direction is used to find directions. 
Based on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was 
developed in olden days for finding directions. It 
has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can 
rotate freely (Fig. 4.6). The needle of a magnetic 
compass indicates the north-south direction.
The compass is kept at the place where we 
wish to know the directions. After some time, the 
needle comes to rest in the north-south direction. 
The compass box is then gently rotated until the 
north and south marked on the dial are aligned 
with the needle. Now all directions at that place 
are as indicated on the dial.
A magnetic compass is usually a small circular box 
with a transparent cover on it, as shown in Fig. 4.6. 
The magnet, in the shape of a needle, is mounted 
on a pin standing on the bottom of the box. This 
needle is balanced on the pin in such a 
manner that it can move around this point 
easily, that is, it can rotate freely. The end of 
the needle which rests in the North direction 
is usually painted red. Below the needle, 
there is a dial with directions marked on it. 
How can we 
make our 
own magnetic 
compass?

Activity 4.4: Let us construct


Collect a few materials like a cork piece, iron sewing 
needle, a permanent bar magnet, a glass bowl, and water.


Place the iron sewing needle on a wooden table. Then 
keep any one pole of the magnet at one end of 
the needle. Move the magnet over the needle 
along its length as shown in Fig. 4.7a. When it 
reaches the other end of the needle, lift it up. 


Bring the same pole of the magnet you started 
with to the same end of the sewing needle from 
which you began, and repeat the previous 
step. Repeat this process at least 30 to 40 times. 


Bring some iron filings or steel pins near the needle. 
If the pins or iron filings get attracted to the needle, 
then that means that the needle has become 
a magnet.  


Pass this needle through the cork horizontally. 
Float the cork in a glass bowl filled with water, 
such that the needle always remains above the 
level of water as shown in Fig. 4.7b. 


When the needle comes to rest, your magnetic 
compass is ready for use. Note the direction in 
which either side of the needle points. 


Rotate the cork gently and wait till it stops rotating. 
Repeat this a few more times. Do the ends of the needle 
always point in the same direction?

Much before the widespread use of the modern 
magnetic compass (Fig. 4.6), a device similar to 
the compass needle made by you (Fig. 4.7b) was 
used by Indians for navigation at 
sea. It consisted of a magnetised 
fish-shaped iron piece, kept 
in a vessel of oil. It was called

4.4 Attraction and Repulsion between Magnets
Activity 4.5: Let us experiment


Take a pair of bar magnets on which North and South 
poles have been marked. Mark the two bar magnets as 
A and B. 


Place the longer side of magnet A over 5–6 round shaped 
pencils as shown in Fig. 4.8a. 


Now bring one end of magnet B near the end of magnet 
A placed on the pencils. Make sure that the two magnets 
do not touch each other. Observe what happens.       


Next, bring the other end of magnet B near the same end 
of magnet A (Fig. 4.8b). Does the magnet A on the pencils 
begin to move? Does it always move in the direction of 
the approaching magnet? What do these observations 
suggest?
You will see that unlike poles of two magnets, that is, the 
North pole of one magnet and the South pole of another 
magnet, attract each other. The like poles, that is, either 
the North poles or the South poles of both magnets, repel 
each other.

Repeat the activity by using an iron bar in place of one 
of the magnets. What do you observe this time? 
	
You will find that both the ends of the iron bar will be 
attracted by both the North and South poles of the magnet. 
	
From this activity, we find that a magnet can be identified 
by its property of repulsion.
Activity 4.6: Let us experiment


Take a magnetic compass and a bar 
magnet. 


Place the magnetic compass over 
a horizontal surface and wait 
for its needle to come to rest. 


Now slowly bring North pole of 
the bar magnet close to the North 
pole of the compass needle as shown in 
Fig. 4.9a. Observe the compass needle carefully. 
What do you observe? Does the needle deflect? If yes, in 
which direction?


Now repeat the above step with the South pole of the 
bar magnet. Do you observe any difference this time?

When the North pole of a magnet is brought closer to the 
North pole of the compass needle, it moves away as shown 
in Fig. 4.9a. When the South pole of the magnet is brought 
closer to the North pole of the compass needle, it moves 
closer (Fig. 4.9b).


Is there any effect on the deflection of compass needle 
due to the piece of wood? Record your observation in 
Table 4.2.


Repeat the process by replacing the piece of wood 
with a cardboard sheet, thin plastic sheet, and a thin 
glass sheet. 
Suppose we place a piece 
of wood between the 
compass needle and the 
magnet. Will this affect the 
deflection of the compass 
needle?

You would observe that there is no appreciable change in 
the deflection of the needle when a sheet of any of the above 
material is placed between the magnet and the compass 
needle. Therefore, we can conclude that the magnetic effect 
can act through non-magnetic materials.
4.5 Fun with Magnets
After learning about magnets, Reshma was excited and 
decided to set up some fun activities using magnets at her 
school fair. You may try making these yourself and may also 
think of some more fun ideas.
