Measurement of Length  
and Motion
Chapter
Deepa, a curious eleven-year old girl, lives in a 
town in the state of Haryana. The new school 
year has started. Deepa needs a new uniform 
since she has grown taller. Her mother takes 
her to a cloth shop. She asks for a two-metre 
cloth piece. The shopkeeper measures the 
cloth using a metal measuring rod.
Then, the tailor takes her measurements 
using a flexible measuring tape. Her mother 
instructs the tailor to increase the length of her 
uniform by char angula (four fingers width).
Are 
the tape and rod 
similar to the scale that the 
elder sister has in her geometry 
box? What did mother mean 
by char angula?
Deepa shares her experience with her school friends 
Anish, Hardeep, Padma, Tasneem and this leads to a 
discussion amongst them.

5.1 How do we Measure?
Hardeep says, “I have seen my grandmother measuring 
cloth by the length of her arm.”
“Have you ever seen how a farmer measures length to 
divide his field into beds? He walks and counts the number 
of his strides,” says Padma.
“Oh, not just the length of the strides—sometimes they 
also use the length of their feet to measure,” adds Anish.
Deepa says excitedly, “Measuring length using body parts 
must be so much fun! Let us also measure something using 
a body part.” 
“What should we measure? Okay, let us 
measure the length of the table in our classroom,” 
says Tasneem.
Padma adds, “And which body part should 
we use to measure it?”
Deepa says, “Let us use our handspan. I will 
show you how to use it. I have seen my mother 
using it. She calls it balisht.”
Hardeep adds, “Okay. Let us also note down 
our measurements.”

Measurement of Length and Motion
Padma says, “Oh, the number of handspans is different for 
all of us. So, what can we say about the length of the table?”
“But why should the number be different?” Hardeep 
asked thoughtfully.
Tasneem says, “I can guess. Our handspans are of 
different sizes.”
Anish gives an idea, “Let us check this.”
So, all five of them put their handspans along each 
other and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their 
handspans are different.
Deepa says thoughtfully, “No wonder people use scales 
and measuring tapes.”
Deepa and her friends compare the length of the table 
with the length of their handspans. The length of the table is 
expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan 
used for measurement is an example of a unit. And the length 
is expressed in two parts, a number and a unit. For example, 
if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then 
13 is the number and ‘handspan’ is the unit selected for the 
measurement.
However, handspans and other similar units, such as 
length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to 
person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which 
measurements of the same length made by different people 
do not differ.

India has a rich history of measurement 
systems dating back to ancient times. Angula 
(finger width), multiples of angula, dhanusa, 
and yojana are some of the units mentioned 
in ancient Indian literature, and used in 
measuring artefacts, architecture, and 
town planning. The angula is still used by 
traditional craftspeople like carpenters 
and tailors. Several objects with ruled 
markings which could be scales have been 
excavated from sites of the Harappan 
Civilisation.

5.2 Standard Units
Several systems of units evolved with time in 
different parts of the world. However, when 
people started travelling from one place to 
another, it created a lot of confusion. This led 
to the different countries coming together 
and adopting a set of standard units of 
measurement. The system of units now used is 
known as the ‘International System of Units’ or 
SI units. 
The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol 
is  m. A metre scale is shown in Fig. 5.2. One 
metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. 
Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You 
may be familiar with a smaller part of the 
metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in 
Fig. 5.3.
Look carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has 
markings (in  cm) from 0 to 15. The length 
of any section between two consecutive big 
marks, such as between 1 and 2 or between 
5 and 6, is 1  cm. Observe that these sections 
Reprint 2025-26
Measurement of Length and Motion
Fig. 5.3: A 15-cm scale
of 1  cm length are further divided 
into 10 equal parts. The length of 
one of these smaller parts is called 
a millimetre (mm). 1 mm is the 
smallest value of length that you 
can measure using this scale. 1 mm 
is equal to one-tenth of a centimeter 
(1 mm = 0.1 cm).
For measuring larger lengths, we 
use a larger unit called a kilometre 
(km) which is equal to 1000 metres. 
And for measuring smaller lengths, 
we use units such as centimetre or 
millimetre. 
1 km = 1000 m
1 m = 100 cm
1 cm = 10 mm
Would it be convenient to use 
the unit metre to measure 
larger lengths, such as the 
length of a railway track 
between two cities, or to 
measure smaller lengths, 
such as the thickness of a 
page of a book?
?
In some scales, you might have noticed another scale 
marking. This scale marking is in inches, where  
1 inch = 2.54 cm. In earlier days, units, such as inch and foot, 
were used to measure length. These units are still used by 
some people.

5.3 Correct Way of Measuring Length
For measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale. 
For example, if you want to measure the length of your 
pencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of 
a room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a 
measuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a 
tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such 
measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor’s 
tape is more suitable. 
While measuring lengths, we need to take care of some 
points. 
What is the correct way to place the scale?
Place the scale in contact with the object along its length as 
shown in Fig. 5.4.
Fig. 5.4: Method of placing the scale
(b) Incorrect
(a) Correct
What is the correct position of the eye while reading 
the scale?
For example, if you are trying to measure the length of a 
pencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye 
should be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5).
No, but we should 
first learn the correct 
way of using a scale 
to measure length.
Suppose we all measure 
the length of the table 
again, but this time using 
a metre scale. Will our 
results still be different?

Measurement of Length and Motion
How to measure the length if the ends of the scale 
are broken?
If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking 
is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With 
such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 
cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this 
mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in 
Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other 
end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is 
10.4 cm–1.0 cm = 9.4 cm.

How do visually challenged students measure lengths? 
They use scales with raised markings that can be felt by 
touching them.

Length of the object
While writing the length, do not forget 
to write the unit also. Thus, your result 
will consist of two parts—one part is a 
number and the other part is the unit of 
measurement.
Some of your friends in the class 
would have measured the length of the same 
objects. Compare the lengths measured by you with that of 
your friends. Are the measured lengths the same or slightly 
different? If not the same, discuss the possible reasons for 
the differences.
Why are some 
length measuring 
devices made 
up of flexible 
materials?
Units of length, such as kilometre, metre, centimetre and 
millimetre, begin with a lowercase letter, except at the 
beginning of a sentence. Their symbols km, m, cm and 
mm are also written in lowercase letters, and are never 
followed by ‘s’ for the plural. Note that a full stop is not 
written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. 
While writing the length, always leave a space between the 
number and the unit.

Anish and his parents fixed electric string lights on the 
arches  of the verandah of their 
house, as shown in Fig. 5.7, for a 
celebration at home. How would 
they have measured the required

In the case of a curved line, 
measurements can be made with 
the help of a flexible measuring 
tape or by using a thread as 
shown in Fig. 5.8.

5.5 Describing Position
One day the teacher informs her students that she has 
planned an educational visit to a nearby garden. She asks 
the students to reach there directly in the morning. Deepa 
and her friends start discussing whether the garden would 
be closer than their school or farther. Tasneem and Padma 
say that the garden would be closer, while Deepa and Anish 
feel that the school would be closer, Hardeep thinks that 
both would be almost at an equal distance (Fig. 5.9).
The thread can then 
be straightened and its 
length can be measured 
using a metre scale.

Who do you think is correct? All of them are correct 
(Fig. 5.9). Then, why are their observations different? They 
are locating the distances of the school and garden from their 
houses. If, instead, each of them had thought of distances 
from a same object or point, say, the bus stand, then their 
observations would have been the same. 
When distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or 
point, then this point is called a reference point.
A few days later, Hardeep tells his friends excitedly, 
“Let us all go to the playground. The sports teacher wants 
us to help her to draw lines with chuna powder (limestone 
powder) for making the Kabaddi court for the sports day.” 
Padma: “We will need a longer measuring tape. Let us 
take it from the sports room.” (Fig. 5.10)
Deepa: “Let us first decide the point on the ground 
from which we will measure the distances to start 
drawing the lines. Let us call this our reference 
point.” (Fig. 5.11)

Measurement of Length and Motion
After a few days, Padma was travelling 
by bus to visit her grandparents in Delhi. 
She was eager to reach Delhi and was 
reading the kilometre stones on the side of 
the road. On one of the kilometre stones, it 
was written ‘Delhi 70 km’ (Fig. 5.12).
Further on, the next kilometre stone 
read ‘Delhi 60 km’. Each kilometre stone 
indicated that she was getting closer to her 
grandparents’ house.
These kilometre stones indicated 
her distance from Delhi. So, Delhi is 
the reference point in this situation.
Fig. 5.13: Positions of kilometre stones with respect to Delhi as a reference point
If the kilometre stone reads ‘Delhi 70 km’ as shown in 
Fig. 5.13, we can say that the position of Padma is 70 km 
from Delhi. When the kilometre stone reads ‘Delhi 60 km’, 
the position of Padma is 60 km from Delhi.
What do such 
kilometre stones 
indicate? How could 
Padma conclude that 
she was getting closer 
to her destination?
?

Does this mean that the position of 
Padma, with respect to the reference 
point, is changing with time? When 
does the position of an object change 
with respect to a reference point? Does 
it change when an object is moving? ?

decide if an object is in motion or at rest?

with respect to the reference point with time. If an object is 
not changing its position with respect to the reference point 
with time, it is said to be at rest.

Measurement of Length and Motion
Deepa looked around her in the bus and noticed that all 
the passengers were seated. She looked around again after 
a minute and found them still occupying their seats. She 
wondered, ‘Are they moving?’ She concluded that the position 
of the passengers was not changing with time. Therefore, they 
were certainly at rest. However, when she looked outside, she 
felt they were in motion as their positions were changing with 
respect to things outside.
The reference point is important in deciding whether an object 
is at rest or in motion. If Deepa considered herself (or 
the bus) as the reference point, then the passengers 
were at rest. However, if she considered any object 
outside the bus (say a building) as the reference point, 
then the passengers (and the bus) were in motion.

and produces a sound (Fig. 5.23). 
	
Now ride the bicycle slowly and count the number of times 
in which sound occurred. The number will give you the
