6.1 Observing Objects Around Us 
Ghulan and Sheeta are thrilled to go to their new class 
after the summer break. They enter their classroom and 
start talking. “What have you brought to school today?” 
asks Sheeta.
After some time, Madam Vidya, their science teacher, 
enters the class and starts interacting with the students to 
draw their attention to many things they use in their daily 
life. She asks, “How are they similar to or different from 
each other? What are their shapes and colours? How does it 
feel when you touch them? Are some of them heavier than

Materials they are  
made up of
The earliest pottery found in the Indian subcontinent dates 
back to 7,000 to 8,000 years in the Ganga plains (Lahuradewa) 
and in Baluchistan (Mehrgarh). About 4000 BCE onwards, 
Sindhu-Sarasvatī 
developed 
techniques 
of 
wheel-
turned pottery production, pigmentation, application 
of protective or decorative coats (called ‘slips’) of 
multiple 
colours, 
decorative 
painting, 
etc. 
These 
techniques became further sophisticated during the 
Sindhu-Sarasvatī (also known as ‘Harappan’) Civilisation 
(2600–1900 BCE), with a bright red surface 
painted with black-coloured designs displaying 
geometric patterns, and aquatic and terrestrial 
animals. The clay used for making pots, dishes, 
bowls and other items was carefully selected 
and cleaned, sieved, kneaded, turned over a 
wheel and finally baked in kilns (baked clay 
is called ‘terracotta’). Pots were used for various 
purposes, from cooking to storage of food grains, 
oil, ghee, and so on. Some very large storage 
jars and other pottery items are exhibited at the 
National Museum, New Delhi.
others?” All things are made up of some materials like paper, 
wood, cloth, glass, metal, plastic, clay, and so on.
Any substance that is used to create an object is referred to 
as material. 
Activity 6.1: Let us identify
Make a list of objects you see around and also write the 
names of the materials they are made up of in Table 6.1.
Based on everyday observations, one can conclude that 
objects are made up of various materials.

You must have noticed that an object can be made from 
different materials and some materials can be used to make 
more than one object.
The method of arranging the objects into groups is called 
classification. Objects can be classified on the basis of a 
common property that they have. 
Similarly, we can classify materials based on certain 
properties.

The materials that are required to make a tumbler should 
be capable of holding water.
What decides which material should be used for making 
an object? We choose a material to make an object depending 
on its properties and the purpose for which the object is to 
be used. 
We may use different materials for making different 
parts of an object. For example, a pen may be made up of 
different materials like plastic, metal and ink.

good idea to 
use paper-like

Discuss in class other properties of sports balls, such as size, 
colour, texture and how high they bounce and understand 
why balls are made up of specific materials for specific sports.
Observe Fig. 6.4 and group the objects in as many different 
ways as possible.
You might have grouped 
these objects according to 
their shapes or by their 
colour or materials they are 
made up of.
We 
have 
learnt 
that 
materials may be classified on 
the basis of their properties. 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
kitchen, we usually store 
things in such a manner 
where similar utensils are 
placed together. Similarly, a grocer usually keeps all types 
of spices in one corner, pulses and grains in another corner 
and so on. You may also visit any chemist shop and enquire 
about how medicines are arranged.
6.3	 What are the different Properties of 
Materials?
Let us learn some more properties of materials.
6.3.1 Observe and identify appearance of materials
Materials often look different from each other. Freshly cut 
wood, which is unpolished, has a distinct appearance, quite 
different from that of iron. Similarly, iron looks different 
from copper or aluminium. However, there might be some 
similarities among iron, copper and aluminium that make 
them different from wood.
Let us do a sorting challenge! Collect small pieces of paper, 
cardboard, wood, chalk, copper wire, aluminium foil and any 
article made up of brass, bronze, steel, etc. Take a look at the 
pieces you have collected. Do any of these materials shine 
when light falls on them? Observe their texture (whether 
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6
Reprint 2025-26
rough or smooth), colour and other noticeable features, 
and record your observations in the notebook. Group the 
collected pieces based on their appearance.
Materials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to 
have a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are 
usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, 
aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their 
lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due 
to the effect of air and moisture on them. As 
a result, we often notice the lustre only on 
their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous 
materials are those that do not have a shiny 
surface. Some examples of non-lustrous 
materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc.
“All that glitters is not gold” goes an old 
saying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. 
Surfaces of some materials are made shiny by 
polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, 
wax or any other material which makes them look 
shiny. These materials may not be metals. 
6.3.2 Which materials are hard?
When you press different objects or materials with your 
hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, 
while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take 
a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of 
wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other 
material or object. Can some materials be scratched more 
easily than others? Materials which can be compressed or 
scratched easily are soft, while other materials which are 
difficult to compress or scratch are hard. However, these 
properties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is 
harder than sponge but softer than iron.
Activity 6.5: Let us observe

Ghulan, Sheeta and Sara are playing hide and seek with 
their friends. Ghulan hides behind a wall, Sheeta hides 
behind a big tree in the garden while Sara hides behind 
the frosted glass door (which has a hazy surface). Sheeta’s 
younger brother can see all of this happening through a 
glass window of his house. 
The materials, through which things can be seen clearly, 
are called transparent. Glass, water, air, cellophane paper, 
etc., are some examples of transparent materials.
Why did Ghulan, Sheeta and Sara choose these places to hide?
Do you think it would be possible for Sheeta’s brother to

There are many materials through which you are not

6.3.4  What is soluble in water; what is not?
Ghulan was sweating when he came home after 
playing in the evening. He was feeling tired and 
thirsty. Ghulan’s mother mixed a spoonful of sugar, 
a pinch of salt and some lemon juice in a glass 
tumbler of water and offered him this shikanji 
(lemonade) to drink.
Ghulan noticed that while his mother was 
mixing sugar and salt in water, the salt and the 
sugar disappeared after a while. 
Let us try a simple activity to explore how 
different materials behave when we mix them

You might have noticed that some materials 
completely disappear when mixed in water. 
We say that these materials dissolve in 
water or, in other words, they are soluble 
in water (Fig. 6.6a). Some materials do not 
mix with water and do not disappear even 
after we stir them for a long time. These 
materials are insoluble in water (Fig. 6.6b). 
Water plays an important role in the functioning 
of our body because it can dissolve a large number of 
materials.

Make your own ORS!
ORS—Oral Rehydration Solution— is used to treat dehydration due 
to diarrhoea or other illnesses. These ready-made ORS packets are 
available in primary health centres and also in the market. Each packet 
is dissolved in a litre of water before use. If these are not available, 
ORS can be prepared at home by mixing six teaspoons of sugar and 
half a teaspoon of common salt in one litre of boiled and cooled water.
Some liquids get completely mixed with water. Some do 
not mix with water and form a separate layer when left 
undisturbed for some time. Similarly, some gases are soluble 
in water whereas others are not. For example, oxygen gas 
dissolves in water. It is very important for the survival of 
animals and plants that live in water.

From Activity 6.8, we can say that any object 
which is heavier or lighter can be measured in 
terms of a property called mass.
The one which is heavier has more mass 
and the one which is lighter has less mass.

Weight is sometimes used in common language for mass as it is 
determined by weighing. You will learn more about mass and weight 
and their relation in higher classes.
6.3.6 Space and volume
Next day, Madam Vidya enters the class. All the students 
stand up to greet her. She reciprocates and deliberately 
says, “Please keep your bags on your seats and sit down.” 
Students are not able to sit because bags are kept on their 
seats. Madam Vidya asks, “Why are you not sitting?” The 
students reply that there is no place to sit because the bags 
have occupied that space.
Continuing the conversation, 
she provides two identical glass 
tumblers to two students and 
encourages them to pour the 
remaining water from their 
drinking 
water 
bottles 
into 
the respective glass tumblers. 
On pouring water in the glass 
tumblers, the students observe 
that one glass tumbler gets half-
filled with water (Fig. 6.8a) while 
the other is almost completely 
filled with water (Fig. 6.8b).

Why is the level of water different in the two tumblers?
Madam Vidya elaborates that both tumblers have the 
same capacity. The water levels differ in each case, which 
indicates that the amount of water in each tumbler is 
different. 
The water in the first tumbler occupies less space, 
indicating that the volume of water in this tumbler is less 
than the water in the other tumbler. The space occupied by 
water represents its volume.
You may have noticed drinking water bottles of different 
sizes being sold in the market. Have you noticed 1 L, 500 mL, 
200 mL, etc., written as net quantity on the bottles? These 
indicate the volume of water in the bottles.

Now you have become familiar with many properties 
of 
materials. 
However, 
all 
materials do not possess all 
these properties. 
Are there any 
properties which 
can be shown by all 
materials? If yes, 
what are those?
?
6.4 What is Matter?
Mass and volume are the two 
properties that are possessed 
by all materials. Can we give a 
general name to anything that 
possesses these two properties? 
Anything that occupies space and has 
mass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter, 
and the units to measure it are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). 
The space occupied by matter is its volume. The units to 
measure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL).
Kilogram is the unit of mass in the International System 
of Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. 
There is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full 
stop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. 
While writing the mass, always leave a space between 
the number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, 
if we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as 
7 kg and not as 7 kgs.
Similarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and 
millilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ 
in mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, 
it would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower 
case and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for 
volume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m3. The 
abbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to 
denote cubic metre. For example, if you have 
volume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written 
as 2 m3. Always leave a space between number 
(numerical value) and the unit. 1 m3 =1000 L.

Can all the materials around us be 
considered as different examples of 
matter? Discuss with your friends.
For example, water is matter, sand and 
pebbles are matter and so is the cup.
Materials are types of matter used in the 
creation or making of objects.
We learnt that materials look different 
and behave differently. We grouped materials 
on the basis of  similarities or differences in 
their properties. 
We find grouping useful as it helps us study and 
observe patterns in the properties of things. Humans have 
been classifying not only things, but also rocks, plants and 
animals. We have learnt about the classification of the living 
world in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Just like 
in the living world, classification of the non-living world is 
also done on the basis of their properties.
Is air 
matter?
Yes! But most of the materials 
that we see today would have 
also existed earlier. I am 
curious to know how people 
classified them then.
We have explored 
and understood the 
various properties of 
materials.
Can you think about what changes the 
invention of plastic brought to humans? 
Is it a boon or a bane?
