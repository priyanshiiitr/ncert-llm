facilitate an exciting nature walk. Dr Raghu is a scientist at 
the nearby Research Laboratory and Maniram chacha is an 
elderly person from a nearby community. Maniram chacha 
is an expert in mimicking bird calls. He is also brilliant at 
identifying a variety of plants and animals. 
To prepare them for the nature walk, Dr Raghu informs 
the students that the objective of this walk is to experience 
the beauty and variety of plants and animals in the nature. 
The students are excited to join them. They are curious 
to interact and learn from them. The teacher advises the 
students to carry a notebook, a pen and a water bottle.
As they walk, they begin exploring the plants and animals 
around them. Dr Raghu advises the students to notice the 
variety of smells in the park and emphasises respecting all 
living creatures and observing them without disturbing. 
Maniram chacha tells the students to not only observe different 
plants and animals but also to carefully listen to different 
sounds. The students come across a variety of plants, including 
grasses, bushes, and large trees. They also observe a variety 
of birds sitting on the branches of trees, butterflies moving 
from flower to flower and monkeys jumping from one tree 
to another. They record their observations in their notebooks 
and discuss them with Dr Raghu and Maniram chacha.
The students can hear the chirping of birds. Dr Raghu 
informs them that each bird has a unique chirp. This is an 
example of diversity in nature. Dr Raghu requests Maniram 
chacha to mimic calls of some birds. Maniram chacha 
mimics different bird calls. The students enthusiastically 
start copying him.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6
Each member in the biodiversity of a region has a different 
role to play. For example, trees provide food and shelter to 
some birds and other animals, animals help in spreading 
seeds after eating fruits, and so on. Can you think of more 
such examples? This shows that plants and animals are 
dependent on each other.
2.2	 How to Group Plants and Animals?
How would you arrange your books and notebooks in 
groups? Would arranging them in groups help you better 
organise your school bag? 
Now, let us look at the world around us. We are 
surrounded by a variety of plants and animals with different 
features about which you have learnt in section 2.1. We 
can group them based on similarities and differences 
among them. 
Activity 2.3: Let us group


Collect pictures of various other plants and animals. Cut 
their pictures from old magazines, newspapers, charts 
and other sources. Paste each of these pictures on a 
different card. 


Divide your class in groups of 5–6 students each. 


Pool the cards prepared by the students in your group. 


Observe various features of plants and animals shown 
on the cards.


Group them on the basis of common features. 


Share and discuss the basis of grouping you have made 
with other groups in your class. 
You will be surprised to see that the basis used by different 
groups may vary. What do you think are the reasons behind 
it? Different students might have chosen different common 
features for the grouping. For example, some students may 
have chosen the height of plants as the basis for grouping 
while others might have chosen presence or absence of 
flowers as the basis for grouping of plants (See Fig. 2.2). 
Reprint 2025-26
Diversity in the Living World
You may have grouped animals based on varied features, 
such as what they eat, where they live, what colour they are 
and how they move.
What is the importance of grouping? Grouping makes it 
easier to understand and study plants and animals on the 
basis of their similarities and differences. 
You will learn more about the importance of grouping in 
our daily lives in the chapter, ‘Materials Around Us’.
2.2.1	How to group plants? 
You must have noticed that plants show variation in the 
features related to stems, leaves, flowers, and more. The 
stems of different plants vary in thickness, height, and 
hardness, while the leaves vary in shape, colour, size and 
arrangement. You might have tried grouping the plants in 
Activity 2.3 using one of these features.
You might have also learnt in earlier classes that plants 
can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their 
height and types of stem. Let us study the features of plants 
in more detail and group them on that basis.
Activity 2.4: Let us group


Let us go on a nature walk again for some more 
interesting observations.


Look closely at the height of different plants. Are 
these plants shorter than you, as tall as you, or taller 
than you? 


Is the stem brown or green? Touch and feel the stems 
and try to bend them gently. Can you bend the stem 
easily, or is it stiff? Take care that the stems do not break. 


Also, observe from where the branches of the plants 
arise—whether they arise close to the ground or higher 
up on the stem. Fill in your observations in Table 2.3. 
A few examples are already given.

What differences do you observe 
among herbs, shrubs, and trees? How 
can you group plants as herbs, shrubs, 
and trees based on the data entered in 
Table 2.3? 
Some plants grow really tall and have 
hard, thick, brown, and woody stems. 
Their branches typically start higher up 
on the stem and away from the ground. 
These plants are called trees. For 
example, a mango tree (Fig. 2.3a).

reticulate venation

Some plants are not as tall as trees. These plants often 
have many brown woody stems that start branching very 
close to the ground. These stems are hard but not as thick 
as the stem of a tree. These plants are called shrubs. For 
example, a rose plant is a shrub (Fig. 2.3b).
Some plants are typically small with soft and green stems. 
These are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a 
herb (Fig. 2.3c).
Some plants with weak stems need support to climb and 
grow, and are called climbers. Some plants creep along the 
ground and are called creepers.
What can be other features on the basis of which you can 
group plants? Let us perform another activity.
Activity 2.5: Let us compare


Look at the leaves of different plants collected by you, 
during the nature walk. 


Do you notice any variation in the shape and structure 
of these leaves?
You may observe thin lines on the leaves of the plants 
(Fig. 2.4a). These are veins. The pattern of veins on the leaf 
is called venation. What differences do you see in the veins 
of leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b?
In some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of 
veins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is 
called reticulate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus 
exhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you 
may observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called 
parallel venation. For example, the leaves of banana plants 
and grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c).
Reprint 2025-26
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6
Do you think that plants can be grouped on the basis of 
venation present in their leaves?
Now, let us try to explore roots of the plants. Do all plants 
have roots? Are these roots similar? 
Activity 2.6: Let us find out


Visit an open area where wild herbs and grasses are 
growing. You may use small herbs for this exercise. 


Using a khurpi (trowel), carefully dig out a few different 
herbs without damaging the roots. To do this, you may 
wet the soil and loosen it. 


Wash the roots with water and observe them. 


After you are done observing, make sure to replant the 
herbs so that they may continue to thrive and grow.
What are the similarities and differences in the roots of 
the plants collected by you? What differences do you see in 
the roots of plants shown in Fig. 2.5a and Fig. 2.5b?
Carefully observe the roots of a mustard plant in 
Fig. 2.5a. The roots of this plant consist of one main root 
and small side roots arising from it. The main root is called 
taproot. Another example of a plant having taproots is 
hibiscus observed by you in Activity 2.1. The plant in 
Fig. 2.5b is a common grass plant. The roots of this plant 
appear as a bunch of similar-sized thin roots arising from 
the base of the stem. Such roots are called fibrous roots 
(Fig. 2.5b). Does your collection include any other grasses? 
What kind of roots do they have?

this out?
Activity 2.7: Let us relate and analyse


Collect saplings of five common plants from your school 
nursery or any other nurseries to plant in your school 
garden. Examples of such plants can include lemongrass, 
marigold, sadabahar (periwinkle), and others. 


Before planting them, observe their roots and the 
venation in their leaves.

Do you observe any relation between the leaf venation 
and types of root in these plants? A sadabahar plant has 
a taproot and its leaves have reticulate venation. Do 
other plants with reticulate venation have taproots too? 
Lemongrass, on the other hand, has fibrous roots and its 
leaves have parallel venation. Do other plants with parallel 
venation have fibrous roots too? Generally, plants with 
reticulate venation have taproots while those with parallel 
venation have fibrous roots. 
Chickpea (chana) is another example of a plant with 
taproots and reticulate venation in leaves. Wheat is an 
example of a plant with fibrous roots and parallel venation 
in its leaves.

Is there any relation among the seed of a plant, types of 
root and leaf venation? Are all seeds similar?
Activity 2.8: Let us compare


Soak some chickpea and maize seeds in water for two 
or three days. 


Remove the seed coat of a chickpea. Now, observe the 
structure of the chickpea and maize seeds. Are they 
similar or different?
You would notice that chickpea seeds are split into two 
parts (Fig. 2.6a). Each part is called a cotyledon. Plants that 
have seeds with two cotyledons are called dicotyledons 
(dicots). Maize has a single thin cotyledon (Fig. 2.6b). Plants 
with such seeds are called monocotyledons (monocots). 
What relation do you observe among leaf venation, root 
types and the number of cotyledons in seeds of a plant? 
Dicot plants have reticulate venation and a taproot system 
while monocot plants have parallel venation and a fibrous 
root system.
You have learnt about some features used for grouping 
plants. Now, let us explore the grouping of animals in more 
detail.
2.2.2	How to group animals?
Just like plants, animals too are significantly different from 
one another. How can we group such a wide variety of 
animals? What features can you think of to group them? In 
Activity 2.3, you have already set some bases for grouping 
animals. Let us explore a few of these in more detail.

What conclusions can you draw from the data given in 
Table 2.5? 
Different animals have different types of movement. 
Animals can fly, run, crawl, walk, hop or jump, and so on. 
They use different body parts for moving from one place 
to another. They may use wings, legs, and other parts 
that help them to move. Here, we have identified animals 
based on the types of movement and the body parts used 
for movement. How can we group animals based on their 
movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each 
other in shape, size, structure, colour, and other features. 
Some of these features can also be used to group animals in 
various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important 
for understanding their diversity.
Janaki Ammal (1897–1984) was an Indian

Success Story—Save Silent Valley Movement
This is a real story of a forest in the Palakkad district of 
Kerala. It is about preserving untouched beauty of a moist 
evergreen forest and its rich biodiversity. The now-famous 
Silent Valley was saved by a remarkable movement led by 
common people who were not even residing in the vicinity of 
the forest. The battle against the proposal of a hydroelectric 
dam across the Kunthipuzha river persisted for 10 years. At 
that time, people used all possible available means, such as 
widespread awareness programmes, letters to editors, articles 
in, newspapers, seminars, and petitions and appeals in court. 
The movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley.

Surroundings 
You might have observed during nature walks that 
different 
animals 
live 
in 
different 
surroundings. 
You have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. 
Does the movement of these animals depend upon their 
surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. 
Fishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and 
fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy 
areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes 
and shapes of animals also differ from one another.

the deserts of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.9). Maya 
shares that she saw deodar trees in 
the Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh 
(Fig. 2.10). These trees are conical in 
shape and have flexible and sloping 
branches. 
Notice that these two types of plants 
found in different regions are different 
Reprint 2025-26
Diversity in the Living World
from each other. Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of 
a region vary from that of another? Let us find out.
There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot 
desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at 
night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these 
areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions 
during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems 
of plants found in the desert can store water and help them 
tolerate the hot conditions in these places. 
The mountains in extremely cold regions experience 
frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, 
some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off 
easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees 
enable them to do so easily.
You must have understood by now that the biodiversity 
varies from region to region because of diverse conditions.
Look at the images of a camel from the hot desert of 
Rajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of 
Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe 
between them? What advantages do these differences 
provide to these camels?
The camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. 
Alex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs 
and wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy 
desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the 
height and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively 
shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs 
allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.

In deserts, food is not available easily. Camels store food 
in their humps. Camels found in the hot desert have one 
hump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of 
food. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. 
These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not 
much food available in the cold desert and they have to use 
food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they 
grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive 
the cold winters of Ladakh. 
What other features can help camels to survive in the 
desert?
Other students also start sharing their observations. 
Kashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small 
amounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. 
As camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they 
can survive for many days without drinking water. 
Maya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright 
flowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. 
Here, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller 
leaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain 
tops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she 
has observed rhododendrons in the nearby mountains to 
be taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons 
may exhibit different features in different regions to survive 
the conditions of those regions.
Sagar tells his classmates that he went to the Andaman 
and Nicobar Islands with his parents for a special event.

We have learnt that the plants and animals living in a 
particular region have special features that make them fit 
to survive there. The special features that enable plants 
and animals to survive in a particular region are called 
adaptations.
The shape of the deodar tree and the height of the 
rhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive 
in the mountainous regions. 
The place where plants and animals live is called their 
habitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea 
or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold 
desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. 
The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, 
water, air, shelter and other needs for their survival. Many 
types of plants and animals may share the same habitat. 
Habitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity 
of a region.
What are the different ways in which you can group 
plants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to 
group them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live 
in water’. 
The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in 
terrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats 
are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains.
Salim Ali (1896–1987) travelled across India 
to observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list 
of birds and documented their travel routes 
and habitats. He recorded the regions with 
high diversity of birds and took measures to 
conserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park 
in Bharatpur, Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird 
Sanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of 
regions he preserved. He wrote a landmark series 
of 10 books on birds of the Indian Subcontinent. 
He is referred to as the ‘Birdman of India’. He was 
awarded Padma Vibhushan in 1976.

The plants and animals that live in water are said to live 
in aquatic habitats. Some examples of aquatic habitats are 
ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans.
Some animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as 
on land. These are called amphibians.
What would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal 
is damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass 
to eat? Can a fish survive without water? 
Check with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours 
to know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal 
they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see 
as often now. These changes often happen when habitats 
are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals 
results in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. 
This leads to the loss of biodiversity.
The population of the Bengal Tiger, Cheetah, and Great Indian 
Bustard has declined in India due to loss of natural habitats 
caused by human activities. The Government of India has 
initiated several projects to conserve our biodiversity. ‘Project 
Tiger’ was initiated in 1973 to protect the declining population 
of the Bengal Tiger. The ‘Cheetah Reintroduction Project’ was 
initiated in 2022 to restore the population of the Cheetah. 
Similarly, habitats of the Great Indian Bustards have been 
declared as Protected areas in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan 
and Maharashtra.

Traditionally Protected Forests: Sacred Groves
Sacred groves are undisturbed patches of forests. Their sizes 
may vary from quite small to very large. Sacred groves are 
found all over India. They are home to different kinds of 
plants and animals, including 
numerous medicinal plants. 
These are protected by the 
local community and no one is 
allowed to harm any animals 
and cut trees in these groves, 
or disturb the area. This 
way, sacred groves are 
a community protected 
treasure of biodiversity. 
Find out about the sacred 
groves in your region.

We are surrounded by a large variety of plants and animals. 
Such variety of plants and animals is a part of biodiversity. 


Plants and animals can be grouped on the basis of similarities 
and differences among them.


Plants have similarities and differences based on features 
associated with roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and so on.


The method of arranging things into groups based on their 
common features is called grouping.


Plants can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on 
their heights, types of stem, and branching patterns.


Plants can also be grouped as dicotyledons (dicots) and 
monocotyledons (monocots) based on the number of 
cotyledons in their seeds. 


Monocots generally exhibit parallel venation in their leaves 
and possess fibrous roots while dicots typically exhibit 
reticulate venation in their leaves and possess taproots.


Animals have different types of movement that can be a 
basis for their grouping.


Biodiversity of different regions varies because of distinct 
environmental conditions.


The special features that enable plants and animals to 
survive in a particular region are called adaptations.


The place where plants and animals live is their habitat.


Based on their habitats, animals and plants can be grouped 
as terrestrial and aquatic.


Due to damage of their habitats, plants and animals lose 
their homes, food and other resources resulting in the loss 
of biodiversity. 


We must protect biodiversity to ensure that our planet is full 
of life, helping plants and animals to survive and thrive.
