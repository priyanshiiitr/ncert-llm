A Journey through 
States of Water
Chapter
On a bright summer afternoon, Aavi and Thirav enjoy their 
shikanji (lemonade). After looking at the ice in the lemonade, 
Thirav wonders about the nature of ice and water.  
Aavi has a counterview to Thirav. What do you think? Why? 
Do you think Thirav is right? How can you find out?
If it does not rain well, even the mighty ocean 
will be drained.
(Thirukkural)
We can put 
water in the freezer 
of a refrigerator 
and check if it gets 
converted
 into ice.  
No, 
these are the 
same substances.
Ice feels hard to 
touch and we can 
hold it in our hands, 
whereas, water 
cannot be held in the 
same way. So, they 
must be different 
substances.
Yes, I know when 
water is left in 
the freezer, it gets 
converted into ice but 
probably something 
gets added to the ice in 
the freezer.

Activity 8.1: Let us observe


Put an ice cube in a cup, leave it on the table and 
observe. 
Ice gets converted into water. 
What can you conclude from the observations? 
Does this mean that ice and water are the same substance? 
Yes, ice and water are the two forms of the same substance. 
These forms are also called states. These different states 
of water show many differences in their behaviour. Water 
flows but ice does not. Water splashes but ice does not.  
8.1	 Investigating Water’s Disappearing Act
It is a rainy morning. While going to school, Aavi and 
Thirav observe that there are a lot of water puddles in the 
playground. That evening, when they go to play, they are 
surprised to observe that some of the water in the puddles 
had disappeared. 
Have you ever noticed water 
in the puddles disappearing? 
Where does it go? Discuss with 
your friends. 
Where else have you seen 
water disappearing? Can you 
think of a possible reason why this 	
	
	
        happens? 
You might have observed that after washing the 
utensils, water left on the surface of the utensils, dries 
up after some time. Does the reason you thought earlier 
to explain water disappearance apply in this case also? 
Aavi wonders if water has seeped through the surface of 
the utensils.
Thirav thinks that water does not seep through the 
surface of the utensils. Design an activity to investigate 
whose idea is correct. 
Activity 8.2: Let us investigate 


Take a tablespoon of water on a steel plate as shown in 
Fig. 8.1.
I think the water has 
been absorbed by the soil on 
the playground. What do you 
think about it?



Observe whether water seeps through to 
the other side of the plate or not.


Keep observing this at regular intervals 
until the water completely disappears.
What do you infer? Is this activity enough 
to come to the conclusion that water does 
not seep through a steel plate? 
If water does not seep through the steel 
plate. Then, where has the water gone? 
This water gets converted into gaseous 
state called water vapour. The water vapour is 
another state of water. Let us think of another 
observation where you notice the water 
disappearing.
While making dosa, we sprinkle some water 
on the hot pan and it disappears. Where does 
it go?  
Fig. 8.1: Steel plate with  
a tablespoon of water
The water which is sprinkled on the hot 
pan gets converted into steam. Steam is 
actually water vapour, some part of which 
converts into water droplets. 
The process of conversion of water into 
its vapour state is called evaporation. 
The process of evaporation takes place continuously, 
even at room temperature. Can you think of other examples 
of evaporation? 
Drying of wet clothes, mopped floor, and sweat on our 
body are some examples of it.
Now what do you think is the reason for the disappearance 
of water from the puddles? Is it due to: (i) seeping of water 
into the ground or (ii) evaporation of water or (iii) both of 
these?
Hand sanitiser disappears as you rub it on your hands. 
What happens to it? 
Water vapour is 
actually invisible 
but the 
presence of 
tiny droplets 
of water in the 
steam makes it 
visible.
Do you 
know?

8.2	 Another Mystery 
Next day, Aavi, Thirav and their friends decide to make 
lemonade. During the preparation, they take cold water in a 
glass tumbler and add ice cubes into it. After a few minutes, 
they notice something exciting about the outer surface of 
the glass tumbler.
Let us find out by conducting a similar activity ourselves.

in Table 8.1. You can also touch the 
outer surface of the glass tumbler to 
feel if there is any change.
Fig. 8.2: A glass tumbler containing 
cold water and ice cubes
One observation that arises in Aavi’s mind is, “There are 
some water droplets (tiny drops) appearing on the outer 
surface of the glass tumbler.” Initially, water droplets are 
deposited and these droplets combine together to form 
bigger drops. You can also try the above process with a 
metal container. You may be curious about where the water 
droplets come from. 
Suggest possible reasons explaining the appearance of 
water droplets on the outer surface of the glass tumbler.

You may have various possible reasons. You may agree 
or disagree with the reasons of others. Aavi and Thirav 
argued with a chain of reasons. What do you think about 
the possible reasons mentioned in Fig. 8.4?

We can take water at room 
temperature in another tumbler 
and find out whether any 
water seeps out.
No, it cannot seep 
out. The level of water in 
the glass tumbler has not 
decreased.
I think that some of 
the water may have 
seeped out of the glass 
tumbler.
It might have 
decreased, but may 
not be significant 
enough to be seen. 
With a tall and narrow 
bottle, even a slight change 
in the level of water is 
noticeable.

Continue the discussion on the given reasons or conduct 
activities to find evidence for the reasons given to help in 
this discussion. Where else have you seen water droplets 
like this?  
You might have seen dew drops on 
plants. Why do we see dew drops more 
in the morning? When we boil the 
water in a half-filled utensil and cover 
it with a steel plate, some water drops 
accumulate on the inner side of the steel 
plate. Where do these water drops come 
from? What do you think? 
When the water vapour present in the 
air comes in contact with a cold surface, 
it forms water droplets. The process of conversion of water 
vapour into its liquid state is called condensation. 
After understanding the concept of condensation of water, 
let us go back to Activity 8.3. Could the water appearing on 
the outer surface of the glass tumbler in Activity 8.3 also be 
due to condensation of water vapour present in the air? Let 
us investigate it.
Activity 8.4: Let us measure   
Aavi and Thirav conduct an activity to find evidence for 
their reasons. You can also conduct the activity by following 
the steps given below. Record your data in Table 8.2.

Do your findings match with 
your predictions? Explain your 
observations.
You may observe some water 
droplets on the glass tumbler. 
Water vapour from the air 
comes in contact with the cold 
surface of the glass tumbler 
and gets converted into water 
droplets on the glass tumbler 
through condensation. There is an increase in the reading 
on the digital weighing balance. Can we conclude that water 
is not seeping through the wall of the tumbler? Can we also 
conclude that the water collected outside the tumbler is only 
due to condensation? No, we cannot say that conclusively 
from Activity 8.4. What more can you do to show that water 
is not seeping from the glass tumbler? How would you 
modify Activity 8.4 to find the answer?
Repeat Activity 8.4 with the following modifications— 


Mark the water level on the glass tumbler with a 
permanent marker or a visible tape. 
What do you observe? Water level in the glass tumbler 
does not go down but the extra water gets collected on the 
outer surface of the glass tumbler. What can you conclude

8.3	 What are the different States of Water?
Water is a substance that can be observed in three different 
states in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On 
heating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. 
On further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous 
state. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties 
of different states of water.
Activity 8.5: Let us identify

Put an ice cube in one container and transfer it to 
another container of different shape. What changes do 
you notice in the shape of the ice cube? Record your 
observations in Table 8.3.

Pour water from one container to another container of a 
different shape. Observe how water behaves compared 
to the ice cube and make a record. Did you notice how 
water flows from one container to the other? What 
happens to its shape? 


Pour water on a clean surface and observe how it 
spreads.

When water gets converted into water vapour, how 
does this water vapour spread? Compare this with the 
spreading behaviour of water.

A Journey through States of Water
What are the differences in the properties of water in 
solid, liquid and gaseous states?
Ice (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the 
container in which it is placed while water takes the shape 
of the container. Ice does not flow or spread.  
Water (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water 
does not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the 
container in which it is kept, but the volume of water remains 
constant. Does water also possess the property to spread? 
Yes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the 
volume constant. 
Water vapour (gaseous state) exhibits a property of 
spreading out in the entire available space. Gases do not 
possess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room 
temperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the 
air around us. The water that evaporates during processes 
like drying of clothes or mopping of floors contribute to the 
water vapour in the air around us. 
You are now familiar with the three states of water. Some 
other substances also exhibit these states. For example, wax, 
oil and ghee. Let us look at some more examples of solids, 
liquids and gases.
Look around and find some examples of solid substances. 
Some examples could be stones, wood and glass.
What are the other examples of liquids you can think of? 
Here are two examples— milk and oil. Think of five more 
examples.
Have you ever noticed that you can smell the food being 
cooked even without entering the kitchen? How does this 
smell reach us? 
It is because the smell of yummy food from cooking 
spreads through the air and reaches our nostrils, even if we 
are not in the kitchen.
What are the other examples of gases you can think of? 
What about oxygen and carbon dioxide? 
8.4	 How can we change the States of Water? 
So far we have learnt that water can exist in solid, liquid 
and gaseous states. How can you change the state of water? 
Reprint 2025-26
Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6
How can you quickly change ice 
to its liquid state, water? 
If we have to change ice  into 
water, and water into water 
vapour, we have to supply 
heat to it. If we want to change 
water into ice, what should be 
done?
It can be done by placing 
water in a cold environment, 
such as a freezer. Water freezes and is 
converted into ice. If we take the ice out of the freezer, 
it melts and is converted into water. 
Can you think of any other example, besides water, that 
can change from solid to liquid? 
A candle, which is made of wax, is one such example. 
How can we turn candle wax into liquid state? How can 
we change the liquid wax back into solid state? We should 
cool the liquid wax to change it into a solid. What are the 
other liquids you have seen which get converted into a 
solid? Have you ever seen coconut oil getting converted into 
its solid state during the winter season? 
Hence, we can see that water and other substances change 
their states on heating or cooling. The process of conversion 
of a solid into liquid state is called melting. The process of 
conversion of liquid into solid state is called freezing.
Let us check the connection between different states of 
water through Activity 8.6.

8.5 	 How can Water be Evaporated Faster or 
Slower?
In section 8.1, we have learnt about evaporation. Let us

Observe your surroundings. What are the conditions that 
affect how fast water evaporates? What differences do you 
see in evaporation on a cold day versus a hot day? Discuss 
with your friends. The following words may help in your

What can you conclude from this investigation? 
If you spread out water on a plate, its area exposed to air 
is larger. Therefore, evaporation is faster. 
What would happen if milk is taken instead of water in 
the above activity? 
Other conditions which affect how fast water evaporates 
Design an activity similar to Activity 8.7 to find out what are 
the other conditions which can affect how fast water will

8.6 Cooling Effect 
Aavi’s mother purchased a new matka (earthen pot) to 
replace the stainless steel pot for storing drinking water. 
Upon returning from school, Aavi notices the earthen pot 
and drinks water from it. Aavi expresses surprise and 
asks, “Why is the water in the earthen pot so cold? I never 
observed water getting cold in a stainless steel pot.” What 
do you think is the reason?
	
Water seeps through the surface of the 
earthen pot and evaporates, which imparts 
a cooling effect on the water. What are the 
other examples of cooling effect? Sprinkling 
water on the floor or the roof during summer 
to cool it, is another example.
How do you feel when you rub sanitiser on 
your hands?
Let us perform Activity 8.9 to observe the cooling effect 
by making a simple and electricity-free model of pot-in-pot 
cooler. 
Activity 8.9: Let us make a model  


Take two earthen pots of different sizes. 


Fill the bottom of the larger pot with a layer of sand.


Place the smaller pot into the centre of the larger one 
as shown in Fig. 8.7.


Fill the gap between the pots with more sand.


Pour water in the sand area.
Now, 
I can understand 
why we feel cooler if we sit 
under a fan! The wind helps 
the sweat to evaporate 
and cools us.
The amount of water 
vapour in the air is 
more on rainy days 
and hence rainy days 
are more humid.
 Do you 
know?


It is also a common observation 
that clothes dry slowly on a 
rainy day. On a rainy day, water 
evaporates slowly. If the amount 
of water in the air is already 
high (more humidity), water 
evaporates slowly.
If you want to dry your clothes on a 
rainy day, how can you make it faster?

Place a lid or wet jute 
sack to cover the top of 
the smaller pot.

You can also make 
a drawing of the 
pot-in-pot cooler once it 
is ready.
Allow 4–5 hours for the mini pot-in-pot cooler to cool 
down. The time range can be influenced by many conditions. 
Observe and discuss how it creates a cooling effect 
inside the pots. Keep some vegetables and fruits in 
it and observe for a week on a daily basis to check 
for the freshness of the vegetables and fruits kept 
inside the cooler. You will have to add water regularly 
to keep the sand moist. For how many days can the 
vegetables and fruits be kept fresh in it? What are 
the conditions which can affect the number of these 
days? What else can be used in place of sand for 
better cooling? 
You all may be familiar with this unique clay pot 
which is called Surahi (Fig. 8.8). In summers, surahi is 
used to keep the water cold.
8.7	 How do Clouds give us Rain?  
Condensation plays a significant 
role in the process of bringing 
evaporated water back to the 
Earth’s 
surface. 
How 
does 
this happen? When air moves 
higher 
above 
the 
Earth’s 
surface, it becomes cooler and 
cooler. At certain heights, the 
air gets so cool that the water 
vapour in it turns into droplets 
which are generally formed 
around dust particles. These small droplets float in the 
air and form clouds. Many droplets join together to form 
bigger drops of water. Some drops get so heavy that they 
start falling. These falling water drops are what we call rain. 
Fig. 8.8: A surahi
Why does air containing 
water vapour go up in the 
atmosphere (thin layer of air 
that surrounds the Earth)? 
As we know, gas balloons 
containing lighter gases go 
up in the air. Similarly, water 
vapour is lighter than air, 
causing it to rise.

Fig. 8.9: Change of states and movement of water
The water from the ocean and the Earth’s 
surface evaporates into the atmosphere as 
vapour and returns as rain, hail or snow, 
ultimately 
flowing 
back 
to 
the 
oceans. 
This circulation of water is known as the 
water cycle. 
Only a small portion of water available on the Earth is 
fit for use by plants, animals and humans. Most of the water 
is in the oceans and it cannot be used directly. We use water 
for drinking and also for many other activities. The number 
of people using water is increasing with a rise in population. 
The increasing demand for water causes its shortage in 
many parts of the world. Hence, it is very important to use 
water wisely and avoid wasting it. Let us keep our water 
bodies free from pollution. You will learn more about water 
and its conservation in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’.
