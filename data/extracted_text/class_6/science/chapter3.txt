Who is healthy? Who is healthy? Who is healthy? One 
who eats food that is wholesome, in moderate quantities, 
and appropriate for the season, time, and place.
(Wise saying)
Medu and Mishti read 
‘thought of the day’ on 
the 
school 
noticeboard 
every day. Today’s thought, 
‘annena 
jātāni 
jivanti’, 
makes 
them 
curious. 
Mishti tells Medu that it 
is a Sanskrit saying which 
means ‘food gives life to 
living beings.’ 
Let us try to understand the significance of this saying.
3.1	 What Do We Eat? 
Activity 3.1: Let us record 
All of us eat food every day. Food is an essential component 
of our daily life. List the food items you have consumed 
over the week in Table 3.1.

What observations can you make about your food from the 
data collected in Table 3.1? Do you eat the same kind of food 
in every meal or do your choices vary? Compare your list 
with those prepared by your friends. Find similarities and 
differences in the food consumed by you and your friends. 
What did you find? Record your findings in your notebook. 
You may have noticed that there is a variety in the food 
eaten by you and your friends.
Do you think that such diversity in food exists in all states 
of our country?

Why do we see diversity in traditional food consumed in 
various states of our country? 
Analyse the data collected by you in Table 3.2. Are there 
food items that are common across states? Make a list of 
those food items. You may find that some food items are 
common in many states while some are eaten only in a 
particular state.
What relation do you find between the traditional food 
items and the locally grown crops? You must have observed 
that the traditional food of any state is usually based on the 
crops grown in that state. India is an agricultural country 
with diverse soil and climate types. Various crops are 
grown in its different regions depending on the soil 
types and climatic conditions. 
In various regions of India, the choice of food may vary 
according to the cultivation of food crops in that particular 
region, taste preferences, culture, and traditions.

3.1.2	How have cooking practices changed  
	
over time?
You have learnt that food habits vary across states. Our food 
choices as well as practices of food preparation may differ 
from one another. Have our food habits and cooking practices 
changed over time? 
Activity 3.3: Let us interact and find out

What are your findings from the interviews you conducted? 
Cooking practices, also called culinary practices, have 
changed over time. There is a significant difference between 
traditional and modern culinary practices. Earlier, most 
cooking was done using a chulha (Fig. 3.1a). Nowadays, most 
of us cook using a modern gas stove (Fig. 3.1b). Earlier, most 
grinding was done manually using a sil-batta (Fig. 3.1c). 
These days, we use an electrical grinder for ease of grinding 
(Fig. 3.1d). Find out what were the other ways of cooking 
and grinding. Why have these culinary practices changed 
over time? These changes may be due to factors such as 
technological development, improved transportation and 
better communication.
3.2 What are the Components of Food?
Medu and Mishti visit the ‘Traditional Food Festival’ 
organised in their school. The theme of the festival is ‘Eat 
Healthy, Live Healthy’. 
The festival features various stalls displaying different 
kinds of traditional dishes. Dr Poshita, a nutritional expert, 
explains to students that ʻHealth is the Ultimate Wealthʼ.

Let us understand what Dr Poshita means by this 
statement. 
Have you ever missed a meal? How do you 
feel when you miss a meal?
We feel tired and less energetic when we do not 
eat for some time. Why do you think a marathon 
runner drinks glucose water during and after a race?
Glucose 
provides 
instant 
energy. Glucose is an example of 
a carbohydrate. Carbohydrates 
are one of the primary sources 
of energy in our diet. Cereals like 
wheat, rice, and maize, vegetables 
like potato and sweet potato, and 
fruits like banana, pineapple, 
and mango are some sources of 
carbohydrates (Fig. 3.2).
Do you know that common 
sugar is also a type of carbohydrate?
Why do you think we prefer to have laddoos as a part of 
our traditional diet in winters? 
Besan or wheat flour (aata) and ghee 
are among the main ingredients of 
laddoos along with goond (edible 
gum), nuts, and seeds. Ghee and 
various kinds of oils are grouped 
under 
another 
kind 
of 
food 
component, which is called fat.
Yes, my grandma told 
me that laddoos rich in 
ghee and nuts provide 
energy to keep us warm. 
Sources of fats can be from 
plants or animals (Fig. 3.3). Nuts, 
such as groundnuts, walnuts, 
coconuts, and almonds, and 
seeds, such as pumpkin seeds 
and sunflower seeds, are some 
sources of fat. Fat is a source of 
stored energy.

foods. Identify more food items that are rich sources of 
carbohydrates and fats .

Polar bears accumulate a lot of fat under 
their skin. This fat serves as an energy 
source. It supports them during their months-
long winter sleep (hibernation), enabling them 
to survive without eating.

Proteins are also an important part of our food. 
Milk products and pulses are good sources of protein. 
Sportspersons need proteins in larger quantities to build their 
muscles. People get proteins from plants as well as animals. 
Some excellent plant sources of protein are pulses, beans, 
peas and nuts (Fig. 3.4a). Animal sources of protein are milk, 
paneer, egg, fish and meat (Fig. 3.4b). Protein-rich foods help 
in growth and repair of our body. These are, therefore, called 
body-building foods.

Case 1
In earlier times, during long voyages, sailors often suffered 
from bleeding and swollen gums. During a voyage in 1746, 
Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who 
consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these 
symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a 
disease called scurvy.
Case 2
In the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the 
human population in the Himalayan region and 
the Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling 
at the front of the neck were prevalent. As per 
norms of the Government of India, an effort was 
made to supplement common salt with iodine for 
preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised 
salt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were 
due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting 
in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling 
at the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre.
The right amount of protein must be included in the diet of 
growing children for their proper growth and development. 
Which of these food components are part of your daily diet?
Have you ever seen mushrooms? They grow 
mostly in dark and moist places. Edible 
mushrooms are good sources of protein.

Why do you think we are advised to include servings of 
fruits, vegetables and other plant-based foods in our daily 
diet? Let us understand the importance of some other food 
components by reading the following two cases—
What do you interpret by reading Case 1? What cures 
scurvy? Lemons and oranges help in curing scurvy. Scurvy 
is caused due to deficiency of Vitamin C. Vitamin C present 
in citrus fruits like lemons and oranges helps in curing this 
disease.


Suggest the possible cause(s) for the symptoms observed 
and changes required in the diet for improvement.

What do you infer from Case 2? 
You may have learnt about iodised salt through 
newspapers, advertisements or by reading about it on a 
salt packet. What does it mean? Iodised salt is simply 
common salt mixed with required quantities of salts 
of iodine.
Salt farming is a traditional practice of a tribal 
community named Agariyas. They practice salt 
farming in the Little Rann of Kutch and other 
parts of Gujarat. For eight months, they live in 
the extreme heat of the desert and work very 
hard to get salt from seawater.

Fig. 3.6: Some sources of different vitamins
Food components that provide energy, support growth, 
help repair and protect our body from diseases, and maintain 
various bodily functions are called nutrients. The major 
nutrients in our food include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, 
vitamins and minerals.
Vitamins 
and 
minerals 
are 
also 
called 
protective 
nutrients. These nutrients protect our body from diseases and 
keep us healthy. Your parents may have advised you to have 
Reprint 2025-26

milk, green vegetables, fruits and wholegrains regularly. 
These food items are some sources of vitamins (Fig. 3.6) and 
minerals. Although vitamins and minerals are required in 
small amounts, they are essential to keep our body healthy. 
What differences do you observe in raw and cooked 
vegetables? Have you ever noticed that vegetables 
sometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and 
less crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and 
others are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it 
not be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into 
our diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may 
also result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is highly 
recommended that all fruits and vegetables be thoroughly 
washed before consumption. 
Fruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see 
how dietary fibres are beneficial for us.
In addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary 
fibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do 
not provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an 
essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of 
undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage 
in our food is provided mainly by suitable plant products. 
Do we obtain all 
nutrients from 
plants and animals?
No, Medu. Nutrients like 
salt can be obtained from 
seawater or from rocks. 
Also, Vitamin D can be 
naturally produced by our 
body upon exposure to 
sunlight.

Mindful Eating: A Path

Green 
leafy 
vegetables, 
fresh fruits, wholegrains, 
pulses and nuts are good 
sources of roughage. 
Eating food that is 
locally grown and plant 
based, to the extent possible, is 
not only healthy for the body but is also good for 
our environment and our planet. 
Water is also an essential 
part of our diet. It helps the 
body absorb nutrients from 
food. It removes waste from 
the body 
through sweat 
and urine. We should drink 
sufficient water regularly to 
keep ourselves healthy.
My grandma has difficulty in 
passing stool. Now I understand 
why the doctor advised her to 
eat food that is high in fibre.
Coluthur Gopalan (1918–2019) initiated 
nutrition research in India. He analysed 
more than 500 Indian foods for their 
nutritional value and recommended an 
appropriate diet in the Indian context. 
He led surveys on the nutritional status 
of the Indian population, identifying 
widespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food 
components. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day 
Meal Programme in 2002, now a ‘PM POSHAN’ initiative, 
to provide balanced food in the government-run and 
government-aided schools of our country. This scheme 
has played a role in improving the health and nutrition of 
millions of children nationwide.

3.3 	 How to Test Different Components  
of Food? 
Let us find out which nutrients are present in various 
food items. 
Some nutrients like starch (a type of carbohydrate), fat 
and protein can be detected using fairly simple tests, while 
others can be detected only in a well-equipped laboratory. 
Let us explore how we can detect the presence of starch, 
fat and protein in some food items.
3.3.1 Test for starch
Activity 3.5: Let us investigate


Take a small quantity of the food items such as a slice of 
potato, cucumber, bread, some boiled rice, boiled gram, 
crushed peanuts, oil, butter and crushed coconut. You 
can take other food items too for testing.



Place a small piece of each item on a separate dish.


With the help of a dropper, put 2–3 drops of diluted 
iodine solution on each food item (Fig. 3.7). 


Observe if there are any changes in the colour of the 
food items. Have they turned blue-black? Record your 
observations in Table 3.3.
A blue-black colour indicates the presence of starch.

3.3.2 Test for fats 
Activity 3.6: Let us investigate 


Take a small part of the food items that you tested for 
the presence of starch in Activity 3.5. 


Place each food item on a separate piece of paper. 


Wrap the paper around the food and press it. Be careful 
not to tear the paper. 


If a food item contains a little water, allow the paper 
to dry. 
Does the paper develop an oily patch? What do you think 
is the reason for this patch? If oil or butter is present in the 
food item, it leaves an oily patch on the paper. Now, hold 
the paper against light. Can you see the light faintly shining 
through this patch? An oily patch on the paper shows that 
the food item contains fat. Which of these items contain fats?
Record your observations in Table 3.3. 
3.3.3 Test for proteins
Activity 3.7: Let us investigate
This activity may be demonstrated by the teacher.


Take the food items tested in previous activities. 


Make a paste or powder of the food item using pestle 
and mortar (Fig. 3.8). 


Put about half teaspoon of each food item in a separate 
clean test tube. 
Precautions
•	
These chemicals are harmful and need to be handled with 
care. Do not touch any of these chemicals unless asked  
to do so. 
•	
If any chemical gets spilled on your body, immediately wash 
the affected area with water.
•	
Do not put any of these chemicals into your mouth, or try to 
smell them.


Add 2–3 teaspoons of water to each test tube and shake 
them well. 


Add two drops of copper sulphate solution to each test 
tube using a dropper. 


Now, take another dropper and add 10 drops of caustic 
soda solution to each tube (Fig. 3.8). 


Shake well and leave the test tubes undisturbed for a 
few minutes.

What did you observe? Did the content of some test tubes 
turn violet? This violet colour indicates the presence 
of proteins in the food item. Write your observations in 
Table 3.3.
What conclusions can you draw from Table 3.3? Which 
food items show the presence of more than one nutrient? 
Which food items show the presence of both proteins and 
fats? Peanuts show the presence of both proteins and fats. 
This indicates that any food which we eat may contain 
multiple nutrients. Is there a food item that lacks any of 
these nutrients? Which of these foods do you consume 
daily? Try to find out other foods that are good sources of 
starch, fats, and proteins.

Are nutritional requirements the same for everyone? Do 
you and your grandparents need the same type or the same 
amount of nutrients? Requirements of the type and amount 
of nutrients in a diet may vary according to age, gender, 
physical activity, health status, lifestyle, and so on.

A diet that has all essential nutrients, roughage, and water 
in the right amount for proper growth and development of 
the body is known as a balanced diet. What changes would 
you make in your diet to make it a balanced diet?

of potato wafers and a packet of roasted chana shown here.
(a) Potato wafers
(b) Roasted chana
Based on the nutritional information on the food packets 
given above, which food would you choose? Why? 
Some foods have high calories due to high sugar and 
fat content. Moreover, they contain very low amounts of 
proteins, minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibres. These foods 
are called junk foods. These foods include potato wafers, 
candy bars and carbonated drinks. Consuming these foods 
frequently is not good as these are not healthy for our body. 
They make a person obese. Such a person may suffer from 
several health problems. You should always remember 
Dr Poshita’s statement that ʻHealth is the Ultimate Wealth.ʼ 
We should take care of our body to stay healthy. Eating a 
balanced diet and avoiding junk food contribute towards

happy life. 
Which of the two foods you studied in Activity 3.9 could be 
labelled as junk food?

3.5	 Millets: Nutrition-rich Cereals
You may have heard 
of jowar, bajra, ragi, 
and sanwa (Fig. 3.9). 
These are native crops 
of 
India 
(Fig. 
3.9). 
These can be easily 
cultivated in different 
climatic conditions. 
These highly nutritious 
grains are also called 
millets. Have you ever 
had food items made 
from these millets? 
Millets are small-sized grains and have been an integral 
part of the Indian diet for centuries. They have regained 
popularity due to their numerous health benefits. They are 
good sources of vitamins, minerals like iron and calcium, 
and dietary fibres as well. That is the reason they are 
also called nutri-cereals. They contribute significantly to 
a balanced diet required for the normal functioning of 
our body. 
Packaged food items must have information about 
the nutrients on their cover. The information should 
list the amount of each nutrient. Sometimes, more 
nutrients are added to the food during processing 
(fortification) to improve its nutritional quality. 
Iodised salt and some baby foods are examples 
of fortified foods. The Food Safety and Standard 
Authority of India (FSSAI) is a government agency 
that regulates food quality in India.

3.6	 Food Miles: From Farm to Our Plate
How does food reach from a farm to our plate? What are the 
steps involved in this process? Who are the people involved 
in this process? Do you know how much time and effort is 
required to get the wheat flour once seed grains germinate 
in the farm? Let us look at Fig. 3.10 to understand the entire 
process of making the chapati that we eat. 
The entire distance travelled by a bag of wheat or any 
other food item, from the producer to the consumer, is 
known as its food miles. Reducing food miles is important 
because it helps to cut down the cost and pollution during 
its transport; it helps support local farmers; and it also 
keeps our food fresh and healthy.

People across India eat diverse types of food, containing 
various food components. 


Choice of food may vary according to the cultivation of food 
crops in a region, taste preferences, culture and traditions, 
and so on.
Summary
Many people waste food, leaving it 
unconsumed on their plates. One must 
remember the time and effort put by our 
farmers and other community members in 
getting the food from the farm to our plate. 
We must take only as much food as we can 
consume. It would reduce food wastage. Try 
to find the timeline for the various processes 
involved in getting the food from farm to plate (Fig. 3.10).
Eat healthy, share, and respect food. Support local 
producers!


Culinary practices have changed over time. There is a 
significant difference between traditional and modern 
methods of cooking food.


Food provides us energy, support growth, repairs our bodies 
and protects us from diseases. 


The major nutrients in our food are carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins, vitamins, and minerals. In addition, food also 
contains dietary fibres and water.


Carbohydrates and fats are primary energy sources, while 
proteins are body-building nutrients.


Vitamins and minerals strengthen our body, protect us from 
infections, and keep us healthy.


A balanced diet provides all the essential nutrients in the 
right quantities, along with adequate roughage and water.


Deficiency of one or more nutrients in our diet for a long 
time can lead to deficiency diseases and disorders.


Junk foods are unhealthy as they contain high levels of sugar 
and fats but little protein, minerals, vitamins, and dietary 
fibres.


Millets are known as nutri-cereals as they provide most of 
the nutrients required for the normal functioning of our 
bodies. They can be easily cultivated in different climatic 
conditions.


Eating food that is locally grown and plant-based, to the 
extent possible, is not only healthy for our bodies but is also 
good for our environment and our planet.


The distance travelled by a food item, from the place of its 
production to the consumer, is called food miles. We must 
aim to minimise food miles.


We should never waste food and only take as much as we 
can consume.
