Malli and his sister Valli are excited for their summer 
vacations. Their parents have planned a trip to visit their 
relatives and friends living across India. They always stay 
in touch with their relatives and friends. Do you also keep 
in touch with your loved ones?
Their first halt is at their Nani’s (maternal grandmother’s) 
house in Haryana. It is surrounded by large fields. Malli 
and Valli are fascinated by the variety of grains piled up 
in the courtyard. Their Mami (maternal aunt) and Mama 
(maternal uncle), along with other community members, 
are busy separating small stones and husk from the grains 
with their hands.

They go around the house to see the fields and the 
cattle. To keep them busy, Nani gives them a challenge of 
handpicking small stones from grains while keeping their 
eyes closed.
The method of picking by hand from a mixture (when 
two or more substances are mixed) such as small stones and 
husk from wheat and rice is called handpicking. It is done 
on the basis of differences in size, colour and 
shape of the particles. If the particles to be 
removed are present in small quantities and 
can easily be picked by hand, handpicking 
proves to be a convenient method.   
At lunch, Malli and Valli are served 
steaming 
hot 
vegetable 
pulao. 
While 
eating the pulao, Nani observes that 
Malli is separating whole black peppers 
from 
the 
pulao 
and 
is 
placing 
them 
aside on his plate (Fig. 9.1). Valli playfully teases, 
“Wow! This is a handpicking method, nice one!” 
Nani tells them about the benefits of black pepper and 
encourages Malli to eat it. 
Later in the day, their Mama takes them to the fields 
where they observe bundles of harvested 
wheat stalks lying in the fields. Some 
stalks are spread in the sun for drying. 
Both of them pick up a stalk each and 
notice numerous grains attached to it. A 
group of farmers are beating the stalks 
on a large wooden log. Curiously, Valli 
asks Mama, “Why are they doing this?” 
Mama explains, “They are beating 
the stalks to separate the grains” (Fig. 
9.2). This process of separating grains 
from the stalks is known as 
threshing. Farmers work hard, 
yet they enjoy their work. From time to time, 
they sing folk songs while working.

Valli whispers to Malli, “Will the farmers 
handpick the grains to remove them from 
so much husk?” She wonders, “How much 
time will the farmers take to separate 
these?”
Let us perform an activity to find out 
the answer to the questions raised by Valli.

Take a handful of roasted peanuts and rub them 
between your palms. What happens?

Is it possible to separate the removed skin and the 
peanuts?

Now, try blowing it. What do you observe?
Which of these components—removed peanut skins or 
peanuts are blown away?
You observe that blowing air separates the heavier and 
the lighter components.
How do you think farmers separate so many grains 
from husk? 
Traditionally, a soop (bamboo tray) is used for separating 
heavier and lighter components of a mixture (Fig. 9.3). 
Next day, their Nana takes 
them to the fields to show 
this process at work.
Malli and Valli observe a 
farmer standing on a raised 
platform. 
The 
farmer 
is 
moving the bamboo tray 
which 
contains 
threshed 
wheat grains in the direction 
of air or wind (Fig. 9.4).
What do you infer from Fig. 9.4? Do both the components, 
wheat grains and husk, fall at the same place? Which of the 
two components get blown away? Can the wind separate 
the two components?

Mami: We use a sieve for this purpose.
Sieving allows the fine flour particles to 
pass through the holes of the sieve as shown 
in Fig. 9.5. The bigger particles such as bran 
and small stones remain on the sieve. 
Carefully observe a sieve. Are all 
the holes of the sieve the same size? 
Will sieving work if the holes of the 
sieve are larger than the substances? 
Is there any difference in the size between 
the particles that pass through the sieve

Sieving is used when components of a

In the traditional Indian system of holistic health and medicine

of various medicinal plants are often dried in the shade. This

Dada: I shall prepare tea for you.
Children: We will also help you.
As Dada makes the tea, he shares tips on how to make a 
cup of tea.  
Balan: After preparing tea, how do you remove the tea 
leaves?
Dada: Obviously, with a strainer. You know if we do not 
have a strainer, we can still remove most of the tea leaves. 
Valli: How? 
Dada: Leave the sauce pan (vessel) containing tea 
undisturbed for some time and gently pour the tea in a cup 
(Fig. 9.9).
Valli: Oh Yes! And then the tea leaves will be settled at the 
bottom.
The process of settling down of heavier insoluble 
component at the bottom of a liquid is called sedimentation. 
When the water (liquid) is removed by tilting the vessel, 
the process is called decantation.
In the chapter ‘Materials Around Us’, you have studied 
that oil does not mix with water and forms a separate 
layer when left undisturbed for some time. Which

Dada: But I can still get a few tea leaves in my mouth

Malli picks up the tea-strainer from the shelf and gives it

Dada: Let me pour the tea through this strainer. You can 
see all the tea leaves collected in the strainer. 
This process of separating tea leaves from tea is called 
filtration.
Balan asks Malli if he could use a tea strainer to filter 
muddy water. Let us try and find out.

Malli: Why should we use a piece of cloth?
Dada: In a piece of cloth, there are very small holes 
or pores  between the woven threads. These pores in the 
cloth can be used as a filter. People in ancient times also 
followed this practice.
But if the water is still muddy, impurities can be 
separated using a filter with even smaller holes or 
pores. A filter paper is one such filter that has very fine 
pores in it.

that this method of catching 
the fish is somewhat similar. 
Malli is taken aback when he sees plastic bags, broken 
bottles, a large fish with a straw stuck in its mouth, and food 
wrappers along with the other fish trapped in the net.
Other than the filter paper, many materials such as 
cotton, charcoal, and sand can be used as filters. The 
choice of filter depends upon the size of the particles of 
the materials to be removed.

know!
Tea bags were initially made of soft cloth, like 
silk, because it could hold the tea leaves and let 
water pass through. Silk was strong and did not 
fall apart when it touched hot water. Later, people 
started using gauze or muslin. Eventually they began 
using filter paper, which is what most tea bags are made 
of today.
