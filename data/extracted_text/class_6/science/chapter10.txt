Living Creatures: Exploring 
their Characteristics
Chapter
Avadhi and Aayush go for a morning walk with their parents. 
Avadhi notices some shells and tries to pick them up. Her 
mother advises her not to do so and explains that the shell 
could be home to a living snail and is actually a part of its 
body. Avadhi and Aayush wonder how the shell that is not 
even moving could have a living being inside! Later that 
day in school, Avadhi and Aayush share this incident with 
their friends. They approach the teacher to understand how 
a shell which is not even moving could be a body part of a 
living snail. The teacher initiates a discussion in the class on 
living and non-living.

but a pigeon is living? What do you think are the differences 
between living beings and non-living things according to 
you? What similarities do the identified living beings share 
with each other?

tasks that you can do but a car cannot. You are a wonderful 
example of a living being. Whenever you attempt to group 
things around you as living or non-living, you can compare 
them with yourself. Which characteristics help you in 
differentiating yourself from a car? For instance, a car 
does not grow. Does it mean it is non-living? Now, which 
characteristics have you used to classify a car as non-living? 
Continue your discussion in a similar way to identify the 
essential characteristics of living beings.
What are some common characteristics that make living 
beings very different from the non-living things? Let us 
learn about them.
Can we consider movement as one of the characteristics to 
differentiate between the living and the non-living? List five 
things around you that can move on their own. Do you think 
that all five things that you have listed can be considered as 
living just because they can move on their 
own? However, unlike animals, plants do 
not move from one place to another. Do 
you consider them as living? 
Even though plants do not move from 
one place to another, they do show certain 
types of movements. Opening of flowers is 
one of the examples of movement in plants. 
Another example of movement in plants is 
seen in insectivorous plants. Insectivorous 
plants are dependent on insects for their nutrition. Drosera 
is one of the examples of an insectivorous plant. Drosera is 
featured with saucer-shaped leaves having many hair-like 
projections of unequal length with sticky ends. Whenever 
an insect enters the saucer, hairs move inward and 
trap the insect with their sticky ends. Try to observe 
the mechanism of movement in other insectivorous 
plants. Climbers also wind themselves around 
any object placed close to them. That means, 
even though plants do not move from 
one place to another, they do show 
some movements.

wear the dress that you used to wear four years ago? No, 
because you have become larger in size. This is due to growth 
in your body. Plants and other living beings also grow. Can 
we consider growth as a characteristic of living beings? 
Living beings need food (nutrition) for their growth 
and development. List five living beings that require food 
to grow.
Now, think of a process without which we cannot live. 
Count the number of breaths you take per minute after 
a normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. 
Record the data and observe. Do you notice any difference 
in the number of breaths after each situation? Do you notice 
the process of breathing in other animals like dogs, cats, 
cows and buffaloes? Notice the movement of their abdomen 
while they are taking rest. 
In the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air 
moves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe 
out, the air moves from inside our body to outside. 
Breathing is part of a process called respiration. Do 
plants also respire? There are tiny pores called stomata 
on the surface of leaves. These pores help plants in taking 
air in and out. Interact with senior class students in your 
school and request if they can demonstrate stomata using 
a microscope in your class. All living beings respire.
Have you noticed white patches forming on shirts around 
the armpits during summers? These 
patches are formed due to sweat. The 
sweat consists of water and salts removed 
by the body as waste products. Removal 
of waste products from the body is called 
excretion. Urine is also formed as a 
product of excretion in animals. Do you 
know that plants also excrete? You may 
notice plants excrete excess water and 
minerals in the form of small droplets on 
leaves. For example, grasses and roses.  All 
living beings excrete.
Let us look at another characteristic. 
What is your reaction if you unexpectedly 
step on a sharp object, such as a thorn, 
Water droplets on grass

while walking without shoes, or you accidentally touch a hot 
cup of tea? Stepping on a thorn and touching a hot object are 
stimuli. Any thing or any event that prompts living beings 
to respond is called a stimulus. List three stimuli (plural 
of stimulus) and your body’s 
instant response to them. 
Do plants also respond to 
stimuli? Yes, plants also respond 
to stimuli. For example, touch-
me-not 
(mimosa, 
chhui-mui, 
lajjalu) plants fold their leaves 
when we touch them. Have you 
also observed that certain plants 
fold their leaves after sunset? 
Specifically, the leaves of certain 
plants facing each other tend 
to come together. This can be 
observed in the sleeping leaves 
of amla (Indian gooseberry) 
tree. All living beings respond to stimuli. Find a few more 
plants in your neighbourhood which fold their leaves after 
sunset. 
Why do the leaves of chhui-mui and amla plants respond 
in this way? Which stimulus could be responsible for their 
behaviour?
Have you seen young ones of cats, dogs or other animals? 
List young ones of five different animals. Have you seen 
young ones of any non-living things such as a pencil, a chair 
or an electric bulb?
All living beings reproduce. Reproduction is the 
process of producing new ones of one’s own kind. Why is 
reproduction necessary? It is necessary for the continuity 
of life. 
When a living being is not able to exhibit all of the above 
mentioned characteristics, despite the availability of all 
resources (like food, air and water) needed for being alive, 
it is said to be dead. 
From the above discussion, we can understand that 
all living beings share some common characteristics. For 
example, all living beings show movement, they need

food, and they grow. They also respire, reproduce, excrete, 
respond to stimuli, and eventually, die. Absence of any of 
these features indicates that they are non-living things. 
Now that you know how to identify a living being, fill 
up the remaining two columns (IV and V) of Table 10.1 and 
complete the activity.
In which category would you place a seed—living or non-
living? Why? 
Let us explore how a seed germinates to observe some 
of these essential characteristics in plants.
10.2	Essential Conditions for Germination  
of a Seed 
Have you observed a seed germinating? You might have 
wondered what conditions are required for germination 
of a seed. What conditions do you think are required for 
seed germination? How will you investigate whether these 
conditions have an effect on the germination of a seed?
Let us find out by performing Activity 10.2.

Regularly observe the pots for 7–10 days to check 
the status of germination of the seeds. Record your 
observations in Table 10.2.


Compare your predictions with your observations.
Do you think sunlight is necessary for germination of 
seeds? Do the seeds in all the pots receive air, water and 
sunlight? Is there any pot in which air is not available to the 
seeds? If so, why is it not available? What happens to the 
seeds in the pot where water is provided in excess? Which 
seeds receive both air and water? Identify the pots where 
you can notice the germination of seeds. 
Do your observations match with your predictions? 
Write possible reasons in favour of your observations in 
Table 10.2. Based on your observations, state the conditions 
which favour seed germination.
Which of the following are essential for seed germination–
air, water and sunlight? Compare the available conditions 
in each pot. Germination of bean seeds requires the right 
amount of water and air. Why do seeds require these 
conditions for germination? Do you think that the absence 
of one or more of these conditions will affect 
seed germination?
Let us understand how these conditions help 
in seed germination. The effects of the following 
conditions have been seen in Activity 10.2.
Water: Seeds require water for germination. 
Water enables the seeds to carry out the 
processes necessary for their growth. The outer 
covering of the seed is called seed coat. Water 
softens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo 
inside it to develop into a plant.
Air and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the 
air available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, 
spaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily.
Light and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for 
the bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their 
germination. In general, most seeds do not require light for 
germination. But after germination, sunlight is required for 
further growth of the seedling.

In the Chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, 
you have learnt that human beings need a balanced diet 
for good health and proper growth. Similarly, plants too 
need favourable conditions and nutrients 
for their proper growth and development.

affect seed germination?

the 
characteristics of living beings which

plants show growth in Activity 10.2? Are 
there any other characteristics of living 
beings that these plants show?
Let us study another characteristic that can be seen 
clearly in plants—growth and movement.
10.3	Growth and Movement in Plants 
How do plants respond to sunlight? Does sunlight affect the 
direction of growth of different parts of plants? In which 
direction would the root and shoot of a plant grow and 
move if the plant is placed inverted? How would you design 
an activity to find answers to these questions? 
Activity 10.3: Let us design


Take some bean or gram seeds and allow them to 
germinate on a moist cloth or a moist tissue paper.


Let them germinate until each of them develop into a 
seedling having a small root and a small shoot.


Now, take three glass beakers or tumblers, and label 
them as A, B and C.
Do you 
know?
Some seeds of flowering plants, like Coleus and 
Petunia, require light to germinate. Covering 
these seeds with soil inhibits their sprouting. 
Seeds of flowering plants, like Calendula and 
Zinnia, need darkness to germinate. These seeds 
should be covered with sufficient soil.
How would you 
now categorise a 
seed, as living or 
non-living?

In each case, let the bottom of the blotting paper get

From the results of this experiment (Table 10.3 and

1.	 When the plant is kept upright, the root grows downwards 
and the shoot grows upwards.
Reprint 2025-26

2.	 When the plant is kept inverted, the root bends and grows 
downwards. Also, the shoot bends and grows upwards.
3.	 When the plant gets sunlight only from one direction, 
the shoot grows in the direction of light while the root 
continues to grow downwards.
After conducting Activity 10.3, we can conclude that shoots 
of plants grow upward and exhibit movement towards 
sunlight but roots of plants grow downwards.
Jagadish Chandra Bose (1858–1937) was an Indian 
scientist who did some fascinating experiments 
with plants. He built a machine called a crescograph 
to record how plants respond to stimuli like light, 
heat, electricity and gravity. With this machine, he 
could measure how fast plants grow. He also showed 
that plants can sense and respond to stimuli.

 What happens to the plant after the fruits containing 
seeds are formed?
Go through the observations you recorded regarding the 
growth of the bean plant in Table 10.4. What changes do you 
observe after the fruits are formed? Does the plant become 
yellow and dry even when you continue watering it? Sow 
the seeds obtained from your bean plant. Watch how the 
seeds give rise to a new generation of bean plants. Compare 
the sketches that you have drawn in Table 10.4 with Fig. 10.4. 
A seed grows into a young plant and matures to produce 
flowers and fruit. The fruit, in this case a pod, contains 
seeds which give rise to a new generation of bean plants. 
The entire process from a seed to a plant, and then, to the 
next generation of seeds is called the life cycle of a plant 
(Fig. 10.4). When a plant stops growing and all activities of 
life gradually come to an end, even after the availability of 
all the necessary conditions, the plant is considered dead.

10.5.1 Life cycle of a mosquito
Mosquitoes buzzing around is a common experience for all of 
us. Female mosquitoes are bloodsucking insects that transmit 
several diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya. You 
might have learnt from newspapers, school noticeboards 
or awareness campaigns that mosquito breeding should be 
prevented. We are advised not to allow water to stagnate 
anywhere in our surroundings. Why is it so? Does stagnant 
water have any relation with mosquitoes laying eggs?

Conduct a safety audit in your school, or at your home 
and surroundings to check for stagnant water (if available, 
carry a hand  lens to observe any small creatures). Some 
common  places where stagnant water is likely to gather 
are desert coolers, planted pots and any open container. 
You may find two different types of worm-like creatures 
(Fig. 10.5). They are larva and pupa, two distinct life stages 
during the development of mosquito. In case you observe 
larvae and pupae, report to your teacher. Discuss with the 
teacher and classmates about the necessary measures one can 
take to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. What differences do 
you observe in the shape of larvae and pupae? 
Fig. 10.5: Larvae and pupae of mosquitoes in a stagnant water body
Pupa
Larva
Mosquito larvae and pupae observed in water bodies 
repeatedly come to the water surface. What can be the reason 
for this? Mosquito larvae and pupae live in water and require 
air to respire. They move to the surface of the water for air.
How can the 
life cycle of a 
mosquito be 
disrupted?
I have seen my mother 
spraying kerosene oil 
on stagnant water. Why 
does she do so?
Kerosene oil forms a thin layer over 
the water surface. This layer separates 
water from air, and does not allow 
larvae and pupae to inhale air. As a 
result, they die.

Let us solve an interesting puzzle.
How will you decide which stage (larva or pupa) comes 
immediately after the egg stage? 
Suppose you are given a container with water from a 
puddle containing larvae and pupae. Design an activity to 
find out the correct sequence of these stages.
You can take help of the following activity designed by 
Avadhi to create your own activity— 
Step 1:	 I have a water container with mosquito larvae and 
pupae. 
Step 2:	 I will separate 4–5 larvae and pupae into two 
separate containers with the same water. 
Step 3:	 I will observe them every day until I see them 
changing to the next stage. 
Step 4:	 If the larvae change into pupae, it would mean that 
the larval stage comes before the pupal stage or 
vice-versa.
Step 5:	 I will keep watching both the containers to see in 
which one a mosquito appears first. 
These observations will help us to learn the correct 
sequence of growth.
Now, suppose you are given a container filled with water 
from a puddle which contains larvae and pupae. Without 
separating them from the container, how would you design 
an activity to decide which stage, out of the two, gives way 
to the next?

Let us learn more about these stages in the life cycle of a 
mosquito.
Mosquitoes pass through four stages in their life cycle— 
egg, larva, pupa and adult (Fig. 10.6). 
The adult mosquito that emerges from the pupa rests 
briefly on the surface of water and then flies away. The adult 
mosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days. 
We have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg 
(stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage II), the larva 
grows into pupa (stage III), and the pupa transforms into an 
adult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays 
eggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues.
Significant changes occur in the appearance, body shape 
and structure during the various stages in the life cycle of 
a mosquito. The shape of the egg is quite different from the 
larva; the larva appears very different from the pupa. The 
pupa appears very distinct from the adult mosquito. Is it 
easy to imagine that a mosquito emerges from a pupa?
The silk moth also passes through four life stages—egg, larva, 
pupa and adult. Eggs hatch into larvae, which then grow in 
size. Larvae secrete thread-like material which they 
wrap around themselves, before changing to pupae. 
These are the fibres that are used to make silk fabric. 
In India, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission 
(KVIC) has set up several centres for silk production.

Is there a change in the habitat during the various 
stages in the life cycle of a frog?

How do the special features support that stage?
Observe Fig. 10.8. You will see that tadpoles develop legs 
but still have tails. Tails help them swim in water. Tadpoles 
grow gradually and start looking like little frogs called 
froglets. They still live in water but begin to spend some 
time on land. They continue to grow and lose their tails 
completely. Their legs become strong to help them jump 
and land. They become fully developed adult frogs who live 
both in water and on land.

Plants and animals are a part of the living world. They 
go through various changes during the course of their lives. 
We have learnt that a tiny plant grows and develops into a 
big tree. We have also learnt how animals grow and change 
from young ones to adults. This journey varies for each 
animal, making it unique and special. We have seen pupae 
change into insects, and tadpoles change into frogs. Such 
changes are important for plants and animals to survive 
and to maintain continuity of their kind. We should also take 
care of them and their homes. By nurturing and preserving 
their homes, we contribute to this flourishing living world.

Summary


The objects around us can be categorised into two types 
living and non-living. 


The essential features of living beings are that they move, 
eat, grow, breathe, excrete, respond to stimuli, reproduce 
and die. Absence of any of these features indicates that they 
are not living beings.


Each living being goes through several stages during its life. 


Germination of seeds depends upon the availability of 
water, air and suitable light and/or dark conditions.


During 
germination 
of 
seeds, 
roots 
generally 
grow 
downwards, while shoots grow upwards.


A plant’s life cycle starts with seed germination, followed by 
several stages of its growth and development. These include 
flowering and seed production. Seeds produced during their 
life cycle would germinate into new plants and the cycle 
continues.


The life cycle of an animal as a result of reproduction, begin 
with a newborn that undergoes various stages of growth and 
development followed by an adult stage and finally death. The 
process of reproduction maintains the continuity of its kind. 


Mosquitoes pass through the stages of egg, larva, pupa 
and adult. The life stages of a frog include eggs, tadpoles, 
froglets and adults.


In some living beings, such as mosquitoes and frogs, 
significant changes occur during the various stages of 
their life cycles. These changes can be seen in body shape, 
structure and sometimes even in the habitat.

                In shaded and grassy bogs,
                There lived a group of frogs.
                They happily sang from dusk to dawn,
                In double bass going on and on.
                One day sitting beside a reed,
