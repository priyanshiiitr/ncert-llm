5.1 Is This a Multiple Of?
Sum of Consecutive Numbers
Anshu is exploring sums of consecutive numbers. He has written the 
following —
Now, he is wondering —
•	 “Can I write every natural number as a sum of consecutive 
numbers?” 
•	 “Which numbers can I write as the sum of consecutive numbers in 
more than one way?”
•	 “Ohh, I know all odd numbers can be written as a sum of two 
consecutive numbers. Can we write all even numbers as a sum of 
consecutive numbers?”
•	 “Can I write 0 as a sum of consecutive numbers? Maybe I should 
use negative numbers.”
Explore these questions and any others that may occur to you. 
Discuss them with the class.
Take any 4 consecutive numbers. For example, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Place ‘+’ and 
‘–’ signs in between the numbers. How many different possibilities exist? 
Write all of them.
7   = 3 + 4
10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
12 = 3 + 4 + 5
15 = 7 + 8
     = 4 + 5 + 6

Eight such expressions are possible. You can use the diagram below to 
systematically list all the possibilities.
Evaluate each expression and write the result next to it. Do you notice 
anything interesting?
Now, take four other consecutive numbers. Place the ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs 
as you have done before. Find out the results of each expression. 
What do you observe?
Repeat this for one more set of 4 consecutive numbers. Share your 
findings.
Some sums appear always no matter which 4 consecutive 
numbers are chosen. Isn’t that interesting?
Do these patterns occur no matter which 4 consecutive numbers are 
chosen? Is there a way to find out through reasoning?
Hint: Use algebra and describe the 8 expressions in a general form.
You might have noticed that the results of all expressions are even 
numbers. Even numbers have a factor of 2. Negative numbers having 
a factor 2 are also even numbers, for example, – 2, – 4, – 6, and so on. 
Check if anyone in your class got an odd number.
When 4 consecutive numbers are chosen, no matter how the ‘+’ and 
‘–’ signs are placed between them, the resulting expressions always have 
even parity.

Now take any 4 numbers, place ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs in the eight different 
ways, and evaluate the resulting expression. What do you observe about 
their parities?
Repeat this with other sets of 4 numbers.
Is there a way to explain why this happens?
Hint: Think of the rules for parity of the sum or difference of two 
numbers.
Explanation 1: Let us consider any of the 8 expressions formed by four 
numbers a, b, c, and d. When one of its signs is switched, its value always 
increases or decreases by an even number! Let us see why.
Consider one of the expressions: a + b – c – d. 
Replacing +b by – b, we get
a – b – c – d.
By how much has the number changed? It has changed by
(a + b – c – d) –  (a – b – c – d)
= a + b – c – d – a + b + c + d (notice how the signs changed when we 
opened the second set of brackets)
= 2b (this is an even number).
If the difference between two numbers is even, can they have different 
parities? No! So either both are even or both are odd.
Now, let us see what happens when a negative sign is switched to a 
positive sign.
Replace any negative sign in the expression a + b – c – d with a positive 
sign and find the difference between the two numbers.
What do you conclude from this observation?
Starting from any expression, we can get 7 expressions by switching one 
or more ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs. Thus, all the expressions have the same parity!
Explanation 2: We know that
odd ± odd = even
even ± even = even
odd ± even = odd.
We have seen that the parity of a + b and a – b is the same, regardless 
of the parities of a and b.
In short, a ± b have the same parity. By the same argument, a ± b + c 
and a ± b – c have the same parity. Extending this further, we can say that 
all the expressions a ± b ± c ± d have the same parity.

Explanation 3: This can also be explained 
using the positive and negative token 
model you studied in the chapter on 
Integers. Try to think how.
The number of ways to choose 4 
numbers a, b, c, d and combine them using 
‘+’ and ‘–’ signs is infinite. Mathematical 
reasoning allows us to prove that all the 
combinations a ± b ± c ± d always have the 
same parity, without having to go through 
them one by one.
Is the phenomenon of all the expressions having the same parity limited 
to taking 4 numbers? What do you think?
Breaking Even
We know how to identify even numbers. Without computing them, find 
out which of the following arithmetic expressions are even.
Using our understanding of how parity behaves under different 
operations, identify which of the following algebraic expressions give 
an even number for any integer values for the letter-numbers.
3g + 5h
2a + 2b
2u – 4v

solved in different ways. While the method you came up with 
may be dear to you, it can be amusing and enriching to know 
how others thought about it. Two tidbits: ‘share’ and ‘listen’.
‘What if …?’, ‘Will it always happen?’— Wondering and posing

The expression 4m + 2q will always evaluate to an even number for 
any integer values of m and q. We can justify this in two different ways —
•	 We know 4m is even and 2q is even for any integers m and q. 
Therefore, their sum will also be even.
•	 The expression 4m + 2q is equal to the expression 2(2m + q). Here, 
the expression 2(2m + q) means 2 times 2m + q. In other words, 2 is 
a factor of this expression. Therefore, this expression will always 
give an even number for any integers m and q.
For example, if m = 4 and q = – 9, the expression 4m + 2q becomes 
4 × 4 + 2 × (–9) = – 2, which is an even number.
In the expression x
2 + 2, x
2 is even if x is even, and x
2 is odd if x is odd. 
Therefore, the expression x
2 + 2 will not always give an even number. 
An example and a non-example for when the expression evaluates to an 
even number — (i) if x = 6, then x
2 + 2 = 38, and (ii) if x = 3, then x
2 + 2
  = 11.
Similarly, determine and explain which of the other expressions always 
give even numbers. Write a couple of examples and non-examples, as 
appropriate, for each expression.
Write a few algebraic expressions which always give an even number.

Examine each of the following statements, and determine whether 
it is ‛Always true’, ‛Sometimes true’, ‛Never true’.
6.	 If a number is divisible by both 9 and 4, it must be divisible by 36.
7.	 If a number is divisible by both 6 and 4, it must be divisible by 24.
In general, if A is divisible by k and A is also divisible by m, then 
A is divisible by the LCM of k and m. This is because A is a multiple of 
k and also a multiple of m, so A’s prime factorisation should contain the 
prime factorisation of LCM (k, m).
8.	 When you add an odd number to an even number we get a multiple 
of 6.
We know that multiples of 6 are all even 
numbers. The sum of an odd number and an 
even number will be an odd number. Therefore, 
this statement is never true. We can also explain 
this algebraically. Suppose,
(2n) + (2m + 1) = 6j,
where 2n is an even number, 2m + 1 is an odd 
number, and 6j is a multiple of 6. Then
2n + 2m = 6j – 1
2 (n + m) = 6j – 1
which means 2(n + m), which is an even number, should be equal to 
6j – 1, which is an odd number. This is never true.
What Remains?

The numbers that leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 5 are the 
multiples of 5. But we want numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when 
divided by 5. These numbers are 3 more than multiples of 5. Multiples of

5.2 Checking Divisibility Quickly
Earlier, you have learnt shortcuts to check whether a given number, 
written in the Indian number system is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10. Let 
us revisit them.
Divisibility by 10, 5, and 2: If the units digit of a number is ‘0’, then 
it is divisible by 10. Let us understand why this works through algebra.
We can write the general form of a number in the Indian system 
using a set of letter-numbers. For example, a 5-digit number can be 
expressed as, edcba denoting e × 10000 + d × 1000 + c × 100 + b × 10 + a. The 
letter-numbers e, d, c, b, and a denote each digit of a 5-digit number.
Any number can be written in general as … dcba, where the letter-
numbers a, b, c and d represent the units, tens, hundreds and thousands 
digit, respectively, and so on. As a sum of place values, this number is —
… +1000d + 100c + 10b + a.
(For example, in the number 4075, d = 4, c = 0, b = 7, and a = 5.)
We know that each place value, with the exception of the units place, 
is a multiple of 10. So, 10b, 100c, … all will be multiples of 10. Hence, the 
number will be divisible by 10 if and only if the units digit a is 0.
Similarly, explain using algebra why the divisibility shortcuts for 5, 2, 4, 
and 8 work.
Let us now examine shortcuts to check divisibility by some other 
numbers and explain why they work!
A Shortcut for Divisibility by 9
Can you say, without actually calculating, which of these numbers are 
divisible by 9: 999, 909, 900, 90, 990?
All of them.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
Can we say that any number made up of only the digits ‘0’ and ‘9’, in any 
order, will always be divisible by 9?
Yes, if each digit is either 0 or 9, then each term in its expanded form 
will be 9 ×  or 0 ×  (the ‘   ’ denotes a place value). This means each 
term will be a multiple of 9, for example, 
99009 = 9 × 10000 + 9 × 1000 + 0 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1.
But this shortcut alone cannot identify all the multiples 
of 9. Unlike the numbers 2, 5, and 10, we cannot identify 
the multiples of 9 by just looking at the unit’s digit. 99 and 
109 are two numbers with 9 as the units digit; but 99 is 
divisible by 9, while 109 is not.
Is 10 divisible by 9? If not, what is the remainder?
Check the divisibility of other multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) by 9.
You will notice that for any multiple of 10, the remainder is the same 
as the number of tens.
Similarly, look at the remainder when the multiples of 100 (100, 200, 
300, … ) are divided by 9. What do you notice?
The remainder is the same as the number of hundreds for any multiple 
of 100.
Using this observation, find the remainder when 427 is divided by 9.
We see that 427 has 4 hundreds; thus, its corresponding remainder 
(upon division by 9) would be 4. 427 has 2 tens, and its corresponding 
remainder would be 2. We have 7 units also remaining. Adding all the 
remainders, we get 4 + 2 + 7 = 13. We can make one more group of 9 with 
13, leaving a remainder of 4. Therefore, 427 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 4.

Will this work with bigger numbers? 
You can see that this is true for any place value:
1 = 0 + 1
10 = 9 + 1
100 = 99 + 1
1000 = 999 + 1
10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when 
the corresponding place value is divided by 9.
For example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can 
just add all the digits — 7 + 3 + 0 + 9 — to get 19. This can be seen as 
follows:
   7 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1
= 7 × (999 + 1) + 3 × (99 + 1) + 0 × (9 + 1) + 9 × (0+1)
= (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 × 1 + 3 × 1 + 0 × 1 + 9 × 1)
= (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 + 3 + 0 + 9).
This means that the number 7309 is 19 more than some multiple of 9. 
The digits 1 and 9 can further be added to get 1 + 9 = 10. Now, we can say 
that 7309 is 10 more than a multiple of 9. And repeating this step for the 
number 10, we get the remainder to be 1 + 0 = 1, meaning 7309 is 1 more 
than a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7309 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 1.
A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible 
by 9. Also, we can add the digits of a number repeatedly till a single 
digit is obtained. This single digit is the remainder when the number is 
divided by 9.

A Shortcut for Divisibility by 3
We know that all the multiples of 9 are also multiples of 3. That is, if a 
number is divisible by 9, it will also be divisible by 3. However, there are 
other multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 9 for example — 15, 33, 
and 87.
The shortcut to find the divisibility by 3 is similar to the method for 9. 
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Explore 
the remainders when powers of 10 are divided by 3. Explain why this 
method works.
A Shortcut for Divisibility by 11
Interestingly, the shortcut for 11 is also based on checking the 
remainders with place value. Let us see how.
Learning maths is not just about knowing some shortcuts and 
following procedures but about understanding ‘why’ something 
works.

This alternating pattern of one more than 11 and one less than 11 
continues for higher place values.
Since 400 contains 4 hundreds, 400 is 4 more than a multiple of 
11 (396 + 4). Since 60 contains 6 tens, 60 is 6 less than a multiple of 
11 (66 – 6). Since 2 contains 2 units, 2 is 2 more than a multiple of 11, 
i.e., 2 = (0 + 2).

divisible by 11?

How about checking divisibility by 24? Will checking the divisibility by 
its factors, 4 and 6, work? Why or why not? 
Determining divisibility by 24 by checking divisibility by 4 and by 6 
does not work. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 4 and 6, 
but not by 24. 
To check for the divisibility by 24, we can instead check for the 
divisibility by 3 and divisibility by 8. 
Explain using prime factorisation why checking divisibility by 3 and 
8 works for checking divisibility by 24, but checking divisibility by 4 and 
6 is not sufficient for checking divisibility by 24.
There are such shortcuts to check divisibility by every number until 
100, and for some numbers beyond 100. You may try to understand how 
these work after learning certain concepts in higher grades.
Digital Roots
Take a number. Add its digits repeatedly till you get a single-digit 
number. This single-digit number is called the digital root of the number. 
For example, the digital root of the number 489710 will be 
2 (4 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 1 + 0 = 29, 2 + 9 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2).
What property do you think this digital root will have? Recall that we 
did this while finding the divisibility shortcut for 9.
Between the numbers 600 and 700, which numbers have the digital 
root: (i) 5, (ii) 7, (iii) 3?
Write the digital roots of any 12 consecutive numbers. What do you 
observe?
We saw that the digital root of multiples of 9 is always 9.
Now, find the digital roots of some consecutive multiples of (i) 3, (ii) 4, 
and (iii) 6.

6? What do you notice?

Aryabhata II’s (c. 950 CE) work Mahāsiddhānta, mentions the method 
of computing the digital root of a number by repeatedly adding the digits 
till a single-digit number is obtained. This method is known to have been 
used to perform checks on calculations of arithmetic operations.

root of 10 more than that number?
2.	 Write any number. Generate a sequence of numbers by repeatedly 
adding 11. What would be the digital roots of this sequence of 
numbers? Share your observations.

4.	 Make conjectures by examining if there are any patterns or

the parity of a number and its digital root. 
(ii)

when the number is divided by 3 or 9.
5.3 Digits in Disguise
Last year, we saw cryptarithms — puzzles where each letter stands for a 
digit, each digit is represented by at most one letter, and the first digit of 
a number is never 0.
Solve the cryptarithms given below.

Let us now try solving some cryptarithms involving multiplication.
(v) PQ × 8 = RS.
Guna says, “Oh, this means a 2-digit number 
multiplied by 8 should give another 2-digit number. 
I know that 10 × 8 = 80. But the units digits of 10 and 
80 are the same, which we don’t want. For the same 
reason PQ cannot be 11 as P and Q correspond to 
different digits. 12 × 8 = 96 fits all the conditions”. Can 
PQ be 13? Think.
It is not possible because 13 × 8 = 104. For all 2-digit 
numbers greater than 12, the product with 8 is a 3-digit number.

(vi) Try this now: GH × H = 9K.
This means a 2-digit number multiplied by a 1-digit number gives 
another 2-digit number in the 90s. Observe the letters corresponding to 
the units digits in this cryptarithm. Pick the solution to this question 
from the options given below:
11 × 9 = 99, 12 × 8 = 96, 46 × 2 = 92, 24 × 4 = 96, 47 × 2 = 94, 31 × 3 = 93, 
16 × 6 = 96.
(vii) Here is one more: BYE × 6 = RAY.
Anshu says, “Since the product is a 3-digit number, B can’t 
be 2 or more. If B = 2, i.e., 2 hundreds, the product will be 
more than 1200. So, B = 1.”
What can you say about ‘Y’? What digits are possible/not 
possible?
“Y cannot be 7 or more because, if Y = 7, then 170 × 6 = 1020; but we 
want a 3-digit product. Also, Y will be even”, Anshu explains.
We can solve cryptarithms using patterns, properties, and reasoning 
related to numbers and operations.

Navakankari
Navakankari, also known as Sālu Mane Āṭa, Chār-Pār, or Navkakri, is a 
traditional Indian board game that is the same as ‛Nine Men’s Morris’ or 
‛Mills in the West’. It is a strategy game for two players where the goal is 
to form lines of three pawns to eliminate the opponent’s pawns or block 
their movement.
Gameplay
1.	 Each player starts with 9 pawns. The players take turns in placing 
their pawns on the marked intersections. An intersection can have 
at most one pawn.
2.	 Once all the pawns are placed, the players take turns to move one of 
their pawns to adjacent empty intersections to form lines of three. 
The line can be horizontal or vertical. 
3.	 Once a player makes a line with their pawns they can remove any 
one of the opponent’s pawns as long as it is not a part of one of their 
lines.
A player wins if the opponent has less than 3 pawns or is unable to make 
a move.
