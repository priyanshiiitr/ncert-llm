In this chapter, we will study some interesting types of four-sided 
figures and solve problems based on them. Such figures are commonly 
known as quadrilaterals. The word ‘quadrilateral’ is derived from Latin 
words — quadri meaning four, and latus referring to sides.
Observe the following figures.
Figs. (i), (ii), and (iii) are quadrilaterals, and the others are not. Why?
The angles of a quadrilateral are the angles between its sides, as 
marked in Figs. (i), (ii), and (iii). 
We will start with the most familiar quadrilaterals — rectangles and 
squares.

4.1 Rectangles and Squares
We know what rectangles are. Let us define them.
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which —
(i)	 The angles are all right angles (90°), and
(ii)	 The opposite sides are of equal length.
The definition precisely states the conditions a quadrilateral has to 
satisfy to be called a rectangle.
Are there other ways to define a rectangle?
Let us consider the following problem related to the construction of 
rectangles.
A Carpenter’s Problem
A carpenter needs to put together 
two thin strips of wood, as shown 
in Fig. 1, so that when a thread is 
passed through their endpoints, it 
forms a rectangle.
She already has one 8 cm long 
strip. What should be the length of 
the other strip? Where should they 
both be joined?
Let us first model the structure 
that the carpenter has to make. The 
strips can be modelled as line segments. They are the diagonals of the 
quadrilateral formed by their endpoints. For the quadrilateral to be a 
rectangle, we need to answer the following questions —
1. What is the length of the other diagonal?
2. What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals?
3. What should the angle be between the diagonals?
Let us answer these questions using 
geometric reasoning (deduction). If 
that is challenging, try to construct/
measure some rectangles.
To find the answers to these 
questions, let us suppose that we 
have placed the diagonals such that 
their endpoints form the vertices of 
a rectangle, as shown in Fig. 2.

Deduction 1 — What is the length of the other diagonal?
This can be deduced using congruence as follows —
Since ABCD is a rectangle, we have 
AB = CD
∠BAD = ∠CDA = 90°
AD is common to both triangles.
So, ∆ADC ≅ ∆DAB by the SAS congruence 
condition.
Therefore, AC = BD, since they are corresponding parts of congruent 
triangles. This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always have the 
same length.
So the other diagonal must also be 8 cm long. You can verify this 
property by constructing/measuring some rectangles.
Deduction 2 — What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals?
This can also be found using congruence. Since we need to know the 
relation between OA and OC, and OB and OD, which two triangles of the 
rectangle ABCD should we consider?

So, ∠1 = ∠2 (= 90° – ∠3).
Thus, by the AAS condition for congruence, ∆AOB ≅ ∆COD.
Hence OA = OC and OB = OD, since they are corresponding parts of 
congruent triangles. So, O is the midpoint of AC and BD.
This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always intersect at 
their midpoints.
Therefore, to get a rectangle, the diagonals must be drawn so that 
they are equal and intersect at their midpoints.
When the diagonals cross at their midpoints, we say that the diagonals bisect 
each other. Bisecting a quantity means dividing it into two equal parts.
Verify this property by constructing some rectangles and measuring 
their diagonals and the points of intersection.
Can the following equalities be used to establish that ∆AOD ≅ ∆COB?
AO = CO (proved above)
∠AOB = ∠COD (vertically opposite angles)
AD = CB 
Deduction 3 — What are the angles between the diagonals?
Let us check what quadrilateral we get if we draw the 
two diagonals such that their lengths are equal, they 
bisect each other and have an arbitrary angle, say 
60°, between them as shown in the figure to the right.

In ∆AOB, we have, 
a + a + 60 = 180 (interior angles of a triangle).
Therefore 2a = 120.
Thus a = 60.
Similarly, we can find the values of all the other angles.
Can we now identify what type of quadrilateral ABCD is? 
Notice that its angles all add up to 90° (30° + 60°). 
What can we say about its sides?
We can see that ∆AOB ≅ ∆COD and ∆AOD ≅ ∆COB. Hence, AB = CD, and 
AD = CB, since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles. 
Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle since it satisfies the definition of a 
rectangle.
Will ABCD remain a rectangle if the angles between the 
diagonals are changed? Can we generalise this? 
Take one of the angles between the diagonals as x.

Quadrilaterals
We can compute the four angles between the 
diagonals to be x, x, 180 – x, and 180 – x.
Can you find the other angles?
Since we know that ∆AOB is isosceles, we can 
denote the measures of both of its  base angles by a.
What is the value of a (in degrees) in terms of x?
We have,
a + a + x = 180 
(sum of the interior angles of a triangle)
2a = 180 – x 
a = (180 – x)
 = 90 –  x
2.
Similarly, in the isosceles ∆AOD, let the base angles be b.
b + b + 180 – x = 180 
2b = 180 – (180 – x)
2b = 180 – 180 + x
2b = x
b = x
2 .
All the angles of the quadrilateral are a + b, which is
90 – x
2 + x
2 = 90.
Thus, all four angles of the quadrilateral ABCD are 90°.
What can we say about AB and CD, and AD and BC?
We have ∆AOB ≅ ∆COD and ∆AOD ≅ ∆COB. Hence, AB = CD, and AD = CB, 
since they are the corresponding parts of congruent triangles.

Hence, no matter what the angles between the diagonals are, if the 
diagonals are equal and they bisect each other, then the angles of the 
quadrilateral formed are 90° each, and the opposite sides are equal. 
Thus, the quadrilateral is a rectangle.
Now we know how the wooden strips have to be put together to form 
the vertices of a rectangle! They should be equal and connected at their 
midpoints.
This method is actually used in practice to 
make rectangles. Carpenters in Europe use 
this method to get a rectangular frame. It is 
also known that farmers in Mozambique, 
a country in Africa, use this method while 
constructing houses to get the base of the 
house in a rectangular shape. 
The Process of Finding Properties
As we have been seeing from lower grades, 
properties of geometric objects such as parallel 
lines, angles, and triangles can be deduced through geometric reasoning. 
We will continue to deduce properties of special types of quadrilaterals 
in this chapter. 
Once you have deduced a property of a quadrilateral, it is good to verify 
it with a real-world quadrilateral, either the quadrilateral constructed 
on paper or simply a surface having the shape of the quadrilateral. 
If you are not able to figure out the property using deduction, you 
could experiment by taking real-world quadrilaterals and observing the 
property  through measurement. Note that these observations give 
useful insights about the property, but with them, we can only form a 
conjecture, that is, a statement about which we are highly confident, 
but not yet sure if it always holds true. For example, constructing a 
few rectangles and observing through measurement that their diagonals 
bisect each other does not necessarily mean that this will always be the 
case — can we be sure that the 1000th rectangle we construct will also 
have this property? The only way we can be sure of this property is by 
justifying or proving the statement, just as we did in Deduction 2.

Note to the Teacher: Gently encourage students to deduce or justify properties. 
Whenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and 
observe, and use their intuition to figure out the properties.
Quadrilaterals
The Carpenter’s Problem shows that rectangles can also be defined as 
follows —
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are equal 
and bisect each other.
Observe how different this definition is from the earlier one. Yet, both 
capture the same class of quadrilaterals. Further, it turns out that the 
first definition can be simplified.
In the earlier definition, we stated that a rectangle has (a) opposite sides 
of equal length, and (b) all angles equal to 90°. Would we be wrong if we 
just define a rectangle as a quadrilateral in which all the angles are 90°?
If you think that this definition is incomplete, try constructing a 
quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90° but the opposite sides are 
not equal. 
Are you able to construct such a quadrilateral? 
Let us prove why this is impossible.
Deduction 4 — What is the shape of a quadrilateral with all the 
angles equal to 90°?
Consider a quadrilateral ABCD with all angles measuring 90°. What can 
we say about the opposite sides of such a quadrilateral?
Join BD. ∆BAD and ∆DCB seem congruent. Can we justify this claim?
Two equalities can be directly 
seen in the triangles. What can we 
say about ∠1 and ∠2?
Recall that we tackled a very similar problem in Deduction 2. We can 
use the same reasoning here.

Since ∠B = 90°,

So, ∠1 = ∠2.
Thus, by the AAS congruence condition, ∆BAD ≅ ∆DCB. 
Therefore, AD = CB, and DC = BA, since these are corresponding sides 
of congruent triangles.
Is it wrong to write ∆BAD ≅ ∆CDB? Why?
Thus, we have established that if all the angles of a quadrilateral are 
right angles, then the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, the 
quadrilateral is a rectangle. Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as 
follows —
Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90°.
Let us list the properties of a rectangle.
Property 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90°.
Property 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.
Are the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel?
They definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the 
transversal properties.
Notice that AB acts as a transversal to AD 
and BC, and that ∠A + ∠B = 90° + 90° = 180°. 
When the sum of the internal angles on 
the same side of the transversal is 180°, 
the lines are parallel. We can use this fact 
to conclude that the lines AD and BC are 
parallel, which we represent as AD || BC. 
Can you similarly show that AB is 
parallel to DC (AB||DC)?
Property 3: The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel to each other. 
Property 4: The diagonals of a rectangle are of equal length and they 
bisect each other.

Quadrilaterals
All these quadrilaterals are rectangles, including (iv). Quadrilateral 
(iv) is a rectangle because all its angles are 90°. However, it is a special 
kind of rectangle with all sides of equal length. We know that this 
quadrilateral is also called a square.
Square: A square is a quadrilateral in which all the angles are equal 
to 90°, and all the sides are of equal length.
Thus, every square is also a rectangle, but clearly every rectangle is 
not a square.

This relation can be pictorially represented using a Venn diagram. 
We have seen these diagrams before. In a Venn diagram, a set of objects 
is represented as points inside a closed curve. Typically, these closed 
curves are ovals or circles. 
For example, the set of all squares is represented as
Each point in the region represents a square, thereby covering all the 
possible squares. 
Since every square is a rectangle, the Venn diagram representation of 
these two sets would be as follows —

Let us consider the Carpenter’s Problem again. If the wooden strips 
have to be placed such that the thread passing through their endpoints 
forms a square, what must be done?
As in the previous case, let us try to 
construct a square, one of whose diagonals is 
of length 8 cm. 
While solving the Carpenter’s Problem for 
the case of a rectangle, we have seen that to 
get a quadrilateral with all angles 90° (and 
opposite sides of equal length), the diagonals 
have to be drawn such that —
(i)  they are of equal lengths, and
(ii)  they bisect each other.
What more needs to be done to get equal sidelengths as well? Can this be 
achieved by properly choosing the angle between the diagonals?
See if you can reason and/or experiment to figure this out!
Deduction 5 — What should be the angle formed by the diagonals?
The angle between the diagonals can be found using the notion of congruence!
Suppose we join the equal diagonals such that they bisect each other 
and result in a square. Let us label the square ABCD.
To find the angle formed by the diagonals, what are the two triangles 
we should consider for congruence?
By the SSS condition for congruence, 
∆BOA ≅ ∆BOC
Can this be used to find the angles ∠BOA and ∠BOC formed by the 
diagonals?
Since these angles are corresponding parts of congruent triangles, 
they are equal. Further, these angles together form a straight angle. So 
∠BOA + ∠BOC = 180°. Thus, these angles have to be 90° each.

This shows that the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right 
angles. This means that the diagonals have to be drawn such that they are 
of equal lengths and bisect each other at right angles. Since the endpoints 
of the diagonals uniquely determine the vertices of a quadrilateral, we 
will get a square when the diagonals are joined this way.
Using this fact, construct a square with a diagonal of length 8 cm.
Properties of a Square
Since a square is a special type of rectangle, all the properties of a 
rectangle hold true for a square. 
Verify if this is true by going through geometric reasoning in Deduction 
1 and  Deduction 2, and see if they apply to a square as well.
Property 1: All the sides of a square are equal to each other. 
Property 2: The opposite sides of a square are parallel to each other. 
Property 3: The angles of a square are all 90°.
Property 4: The diagonals of a square are of equal length and they bisect 
each other at 90°.
There is one more special property of a square. 
What are the measures of ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, and ∠4? See if you can reason 
and/or experiment to figure this out!
In ∆ADC, we have,
∠1 + ∠3 + 90 = 180
Since AD = DC, we have ∠1 = ∠3.
Thus, ∠1 = ∠3 = 45°. 
Similarly, find ∠2 and ∠4.
Thus, we have another property of a square —
Property 5: The diagonals of a square divide the angles of the square into 
equal halves. This can also be expressed as — The diagonals 
of a square bisect the angles of the square.

4.2 Angles in a Quadrilateral
Is it possible to construct a quadrilateral with three angles equal to 90° 
and the fourth angle not equal to 90°?
You might have observed through constructions that this may not be 
possible.
But why not?
This is due to a general property of quadrilaterals related to their 
angles. 
We have seen that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°. There is 
a similar regularity in the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral.

Consider a quadrilateral SOME.
Draw a diagonal SM. We get two 
triangles ∆SEM and ∆SOM.
In ∆SEM, we have ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 = 180°. 
And in ∆SOM, ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠6 = 180°.
What do we get when we add all six 
angles? 
We will have
∠1+ ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠6 = 180° + 180° 
= 360°.
Or, (∠1+ ∠4) + (∠3 + ∠6) +∠2 + ∠5 = 360°.
Since (∠1 + ∠4), (∠3 + ∠6), ∠2 and ∠5 are the angles of this quadrilateral, 
we have the following result —
The sum of all angles in any quadrilateral is 360°.
This explains why it is impossible for a quadrilateral to have three 
right angles, with the fourth angle not right angle.
4.3 More Quadrilaterals with Parallel Opposite 
Sides
Rectangles (and therefore squares) have parallel opposite sides. 
Are there quadrilaterals that have parallel opposite sides that are not 
rectangles?
Let us try constructing one.
This can be easily done by drawing two pairs of parallel lines, ensuring 
that they do not meet at right angles. 
Construct such a figure by recalling how parallel lines can be 
constructed using a ruler and a set-square, 
or a compass and a ruler.
Observe the quadrilateral ABCD. It has 
parallel opposite sides but is not a rectangle. 
Thus, a larger set of quadrilaterals exists 
in which the opposite sides are parallel. Such 
quadrilaterals are called parallelograms.

Is a rectangle a parallelogram? 
A rectangle has opposite sides parallel. So, it satisfies the 
parallelogram’s definition. Hence, it is indeed a parallelogram. More 
specifically, a rectangle is a special kind of parallelogram with all its 
angles equal to 90°.
Let us represent this relation using a Venn diagram.
To understand the relations between the sides and the angles of a 
parallelogram, let us construct the following figure.

Deduction 6 — What can we say about the angles of a parallelogram?
In the parallelogram ABCD, AB||CD, and AD is a transversal to them.
∠A + ∠D = 180° (sum of the 
internal angles on the same side of 
a transversal).
Therefore, 
∠D = 180 – ∠A = 180 – 30 = 150°.
Similarly, AD||BC, and AB and 
CD are transversals to them.
So, ∠A + ∠B = 180°.
So, ∠C + ∠D = 180°.
Using these equations, we get ∠B = 150° and ∠C = 30°.
We see that in this parallelogram, the adjacent pairs of angles add 
up to 180° and opposite pairs of angles are equal.
Thus,
∠A + ∠B = 180°, ∠A + ∠D = 180°, ∠C + ∠D = 180°, and ∠B + ∠C = 180°.
And,
∠A = ∠C, and ∠B = ∠D. 
Since the adjacent angles are the interior angles on the same side of 
a transversal to a pair of parallel lines, they must add up to 180°.
What about the opposite angles? Will they be equal in all parallelograms? 
If yes, how can we be sure?
Let us take one of the angles to be x.
What are the other angles?
Since ∠P + ∠R = 180°, 
∠R = 180 – ∠P = 180 – x.
Similarly, since ∠A + ∠R = 180°, 
∠A = 180 – ∠R = 180 – (180 – x) = 180 – 180 + x = x.
Thus, ∠P = ∠A = x.
Similarly, we can deduce that ∠ R = ∠E = 180 – x. 
Therefore, this shows that the opposite angles of a parallelogram 
are always equal.
Deduction 7 — What can we say about the sides of a parallelogram?
By looking at a parallelogram, it appears that the opposite sides are

In ∆ABD and ∆CDB, the angles 
marked with a single arc are equal 
as they are the opposite angles of a 
parallelogram.
Since AD||BC, and BD is a transversal 
to it, the angles marked with double 
arcs are equal as they are alternate 
angles.
So, by the AAS condition, the 
triangles are congruent, that is, ∆ABD ≅ ∆CDB.
Therefore, AD = CB, and AB = CD.
Thus, the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.

The angles marked using a single arc 
are equal, and so are the angles marked 
using a double arc, since they are alternate 
angles of parallel lines.
Thus, by the ASA condition, the triangles 
are congruent, that is, 
∆AOE ≅ ∆YOS.
Therefore, OA = OY, and OE = OS, since they are corresponding parts 
of congruent triangles.
Thus, O is the midpoint of both diagonals.
Is it wrong to write ∆AOE ≅ ∆SOY? Why?
Property 4: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
Do the diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at a particular angle?
4.4 Quadrilaterals with Equal Sidelengths
Are squares the only quadrilaterals that have 
equal sidelengths? Let us explore this question 
through construction.
Draw two equal sides AD and AB, that are 
not perpendicular to each other.
Can we complete this quadrilateral so that all its sides are of the same 
length?
Mark a point C whose distance from 
B and D is equal to AB (or AD). To do this, 
measure AB using a compass. Keeping 
this length as the radius, cut arcs from 
B and D.
Now we have a quadrilateral with 
equal sidelengths and one of its angles 
50°. Note that we could have constructed 
such a quadrilateral by taking any angle less than 180° (in place of 50°).
A quadrilateral in which all the sides have the same length is a 
rhombus.

What are the other angles of the rhombus ABCD that we have 
constructed? Reason and/or experiment to figure this out.
Deduction 9 — What can we say about the angles in a rhombus?
Consider a rhombus GAME.
In ∆GAE, since GE = GA, a = d.
Similarly, in ∆MAE, since ME = MA, 
b = c. 
It can be seen that ∆GAE ≅ ∆MAE 
(How?)
So, a = b, c = d and ∠G = ∠M (since 
they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles).
Thus, we have, a = b = c = d.
These facts hold for any rhombus. Let us apply them to the rhombus 
ABCD that we constructed earlier. Let the four equal angles formed by 
the diagonal be a, as shown in the figure
In ∆ADB, we have
a + a + 50 = 180°.
So, a = 65°.
Thus, the angles of the rhombus ABCD 
are 50°, 130°, 50°, and 130°.
So, in a rhombus opposite angles are 
equal to each other.
Interestingly, there is one more way by 
which we could have figured out the other 
angles of the rhombus ABCD. We have 
shown that in a general rhombus GAME, the four angles formed by a 
diagonal are equal to each other.

Consider the lines EM and GA and its 
transversal AE. Since the alternate 
angles are equal, EM||GA.
Similarly consider the lines GE 
and AM and its transversal AE. 
Since the alternate angles are 
equal, GE||AM.
Quadrilaterals
As opposite sides are parallel, GAME 
is also a parallelogram. Thus, every 
rhombus is a parallelogram, and the 
properties of a parallelogram hold 
true for a rhombus as well. Thus, the 
adjacent angles of a rhombus add up to 
180°, and the opposite angles are equal 
(verify that the arguments in Deduction 6 can be applied to a rhombus 
as well!).
Thus, in rhombus ABCD, 
∠A = ∠C = 50°, and
∠D = ∠B = 180  –  50 = 130°.
So a rhombus is a parallelogram, and a rectangle is also a parallelogram. 
How can this be represented using a Venn diagram?
Where will the set of squares occur in this diagram? 
We know that a square is a rectangle. Since the opposite sides of a 
square are parallel, a square is also a parallelogram. Further, since all 
the sides of a square have the same length, a square is also a rhombus.
Thus, the Venn diagram will be as follows.

Let us list the properties of a rhombus. 
Property 1: All the sides of a rhombus are equal to each other.
Property 2: The opposite sides of a rhombus are parallel to each other.
Property 3: In a rhombus, the adjacent angles add up to 180°, and the 
opposite angles are equal.
Are the diagonals of a rhombus equal?
Property 4: The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other.
Property 5: The diagonals of a rhombus bisect its angles.

Do the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at any particular angle? Reason 
out and/or experiment to figure this out!
Deduction 10 — What can we say about the angles formed by the 
diagonals of a rhombus at their point of intersection?
In the rhombus GAME, we have 
∆GEO ≅ ∆MEO (why?).
So, ∠GOE = ∠MOE, as they are 
corresponding parts of congruent 
triangles. As they add up to 180°, 
they should be 90° each.
Property 6: Diagonals of a rhombus intersect each other at an angle of 
90°.

This quadrilateral looks like a kite. Observe that 
the adjacent sides are of the same length.
Kite: A kite is a quadrilateral that can be labelled 
ABCD such that AB = BC, and CD = DA.

Trapezium
Parallelograms are quadrilaterals that have 
parallel opposite sides. We get a new type 
of quadrilateral if we relax this condition.
Trapezium: A trapezium is a quadrilateral 
with at least one pair of parallel opposite 
sides.
Construct a trapezium. Measure the base angles (marked in the figure).
Can you find the remaining angles without measuring them?
Since PQ||SR, we have
Property 1: ∠ S + ∠P = 180° and ∠R + ∠Q = 180°.
Using these facts, the remaining angles can easily be found. Verify 
your answer after finding them.
When the non-parallel sides of a trapezium have the same lengths, 
the trapezium is called an isosceles trapezium.
How do we construct an isosceles trapezium?
Construct an isosceles trapezium UVWX, with UV||XW. Measure ∠U. 
Mark X and W such 
that UX = VW

Can you find the remaining angles without measuring them?
Does it appear that the angles opposite to the equal sides — ∠U and 
∠V — are also equal? Can we find congruent triangles here?
Consider line segments XY and WZ perpendicular to UV.
What type of quadrilateral is XWZY?
Since XW||UV, 
a = 180° – ∠XYZ = 90°, and 
b = 180° – ∠WZY = 90° (since the internal 
angles on the same side of a transversal 
add up to 180°)
Hence, XWZY is a rectangle.

Quadrilaterals
Now, it can be shown that ∆UXY ≅ ∆VWZ. (How?)
Thus, ∠U = ∠V.
Using this fact, the remaining angles of the isosceles trapezium can be 
determined. Verify the angles by measurement. 
Property 2: In an isosceles trapezium, the angles opposite to the equal 
sides are equal.
