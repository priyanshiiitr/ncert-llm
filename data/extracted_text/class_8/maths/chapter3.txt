A STORY OF 
NUMBERS
3.1 Reema’s Curiosity
One lazy afternoon, Reema was flipping through an old book when — 
whoosh! — a piece of paper slipped out and floated to the floor. She 
picked it up and stared at the strange symbols all over it. “What is this?” 
she wondered.
She ran to her father, holding the paper as if it were a secret treasure. 
He looked at it and smiled. “Around 4000 years ago, there flourished a 
civilisation in a region called Mesopotamia, in the western part of Asia, 
containing a major part of the present-day Iraq and a few other 
neighbouring countries. This is one of the ways they wrote their 
numbers!”
Reema’s eyes lit up, “Seriously? These strange symbols were numbers?” 
Her curiosity was sparked, and questions started swirling in her head.
Since 
when have 
humans been 
counting?
What was their 
need for counting? 
What were they

Since when 
have people 
been writing 
numbers in 
the modern 
form?
How would the 
Mesopotamians  
have written 
20? 50? 100?
A Story of Numbers
Sensing her curiosity, her father started telling her how the idea of 
number and number representation evolved over the course of time, 
across geographies, to finally reach its modern efficient form. 
Get ready to travel back in time with them!
Humans had the need to count even as early as the Stone 
Age. They were counting to determine the quantity of food 
they had, the number of animals in their livestock, details 
regarding trades of goods, the number of offerings given in 
rituals, etc. They also wanted to keep track of the passing 
days, e.g., to know and predict when important events such 
as the new moon, full moon, or onset of a season would occur. 
However, when they said or wrote down such numbers, they 
didn’t make use of the numbers that we use today.
The structure of the modern oral and written numbers that we use 
today had its origin thousands of years ago in India. Ancient Indian texts, 
such as the Yajurveda Samhita, mentioned names of numbers based on 
powers of 10, almost as we say them orally today. For example, they listed 
names for the numbers one (eka), ten (dasha), hundred (shata), thousand 
(sahasra), ten thousand (āyuta), etc., all the way up to 1012 and beyond.
The way we write our numbers today — using the digits 0 through 9 — 
also originated and were developed in India, around 2000 years ago. The 
first known instance of numbers being 
written using ten digits, including the digit 0 
(which was then notated as a dot), occurs in 
the Bakhshali manuscript (c. 3rd century 
CE). Aryabhata (c. 499 CE) was the first 
mathematician to fully explain, and do 
elaborate scientific computations with the 
Indian system of 10 symbols.
The Indian number system was transmitted to the Arab world 
by around 800 CE. It was popularised in the Arab world by the great 
Persian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī (after whom the word ‘algorithm’ 
is named) through his book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals 
(c. 825) and by the noted philosopher Al-Kindi through his work On the 
Use of the Hindu Numerals (c. 830).
From the Arab world, the Hindu numerals were transmitted to Europe 
and to parts of Africa by around 1100 CE. Though Al-Khwārizmī’s work 
on calculation with Hindu numerals was translated into Latin, it was the 
Italian mathematician Fibonacci who around the year 1200 really made 
the case to Europe to adopt the Indian numerals. However, the Roman 
numerals were so ingrained in European thinking and writing at the 
time that the Indian numerals did not gain widespread use for several 
more centuries. But eventually, during the European Renaissance and 
by the 17th century, not adopting them became impossible or it would 
impede scientific progress. 
Zero in the Bakhshali manuscript

“The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten 
symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in 
India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound 
importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated 
calculations and placed arithmetic foremost among useful inventions.”
— Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749 – 1827)
Their use then spread to every continent, and are now used in every 
corner of the world.
 Because European scholars learned the Indian numerals from the 
Arab world, they called them ‛Arabic numerals’ to reflect their European 
perspective. On the other hand, as noted above, Arab scholars, such as 
Al-Khwārizmī and Al-Kindi, called them ‛Hindu numerals’. During the 
period of European colonisation, the European term Arabic numbers 
became widely used. However, in recent years, this mistake is being 
corrected in many textbooks and documents around the world, including 
in Europe.  The most commonly used terminologies for the numbers we 
use today are ‛Hindu numerals’, ‛Indian numerals’, and the transitional 
‛Hindu-Arabic numerals’. It is worth noting that the word ‛Hindu’ here 
does not refer to a religion, but rather a geography/people from whom 
these numbers came.
The shape of the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 used to write numbers in the Indian 
number system today evolved over a period of time, as shown below:
Evolution of the digits used in the Indian number system
Prior to the global adoption of the Indian system of numerals, different 
groups of people used different methods of representing numbers. We 
A Story of Numbers
shall take a glimpse of some of them. We will not be looking at different 
systems in a chronological order, but rather an order that shows us the 
main stages in the development of the idea of number representation. 
But first, let us explore some of the foundational ideas needed to count 
and to determine the number of objects in a given collection.
The Mechanism of Counting
Imagine that we are living in the Stone Age, say, around ten thousand 
years ago. Suppose we have a herd of cows. Here are some natural 
questions that we might ask about our herd —
Q1.	How do we ensure that all cows have returned safely after 
grazing?
Q2.	Do we have fewer cows than our neighbour?
Q3.	 If there are fewer, how many more cows would we need so 
that we have the same number of cows as our neighbour?
We need to tackle these questions without the use of the 
number names or written numbers of the Hindu number 
system. How do we do it?
Here are some possible methods.
Method 1: We could tackle the questions by using pebbles, sticks or 
any object that is available in abundance. Let us choose sticks. For every 
cow in the herd, we could keep a stick. The final collection of sticks tells 
us the number of cows, which can be used to check if any cows have 
gone missing.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
This way of associating each cow with a stick, such that no two cows are 
associated or mapped to the same stick is called a one-to-one mapping. 
This mapping can then be used to come up with a way to represent 
numbers, as shown in the table.

How will you use such sticks to answer the other two questions (Q2 and 
Q3)?
Method 2: Instead of objects, we could use a standard sequence of 
sounds or names. For example, we could use the sounds of the letters 
of any language. While counting, we could make a one-to-one mapping 
between the objects and the letters: that is, associate each object to be 
counted with a letter, following the letter-order. This mapping can then 
be used to come up with a way of verbally representing numbers.
For example, we get the following number representation if we use 
English letters ‘a’ to ‘z’.

A Story of Numbers
An obvious limitation of using only the letters of the English alphabet 
in this form is that it cannot be used to count collections having more 
than 26 objects.
How many numbers can you represent in this way using the sounds 
of the letters of your language?
Method 3: We could use a sequence of written symbols as follows.
Do you see a way of extending this method to represent bigger numbers 
as well? How?
From the discussion above, we see that for counting and finding the 
size of a collection, we need a standard sequence of objects, or names, 
or written symbols, that has a fixed order. Let us call this standard 
sequence a number system. A collection of objects can be counted by 
making a one-to-one mapping between them and the standard sequence, 
following the sequence order.
Since there is no end to numbers, the challenge is to come up with 
an unending standard sequence/number system that is easy to count 
with. Using sticks gives an unending standard sequence/number system. 
However, it is not convenient to count larger collections, as we will 
need as many sticks as the number of objects being counted. Using the 
sounds of the letters of a language, as in Method 2, is convenient for 
the counting process but is not an unending standard sequence/number 
system. The standard sequence/number system given in Method 3 was 
actually the system used in Europe before it got replaced by the Hindu 
number system. It is called the Roman number system. It was widely 
used in Europe for centuries, and was convenient for many purposes, 
but had the similar drawback that one cannot write arbitrarily large 
numbers without introducing more and more symbols. We will learn 
more about this system of writing numbers later on.

As illustrated by the three methods, history gives us examples of 
number systems formed using physical objects (such as sticks, pebbles, 
body parts, etc.), names, and written symbols. Some groups of people 
had numbers represented both by physical objects as well as by names, 
while others like the Chinese had all three forms of representation. The 
symbols occurring in a written number system are called numerals. 
For example, 0, 1, 5, 36, 193, etc., are some of the numerals occurring in 
the Hindu number system. Numerals representing ‘smaller’ numbers 
always had names, and so a number system composed of written 
symbols always went hand in hand with a number system composed of 
names, as is the case with the modern-day Hindu system. 
Figure it Out
1.	 Suppose you are using the number system that uses sticks to 
represent numbers, as in Method 1. Without using either the 
number names or the numerals of the Hindu number system, 
give a method for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing 
two numbers or two collections of sticks. 
2.	 One way of extending the number system in Method 2 is by 
using strings with more than one letter — for example, we could 
use ‘aa’ for 27. How can you extend this system to represent all 
the numbers? There are many ways of doing it! 
3.	 Try making your own number system. 
3.2 Some Early Number Systems
I. Use of Body Parts
Many groups of people across the world have used their hands and body 
parts for counting. Here is how a group of people in Papua New Guinea 
used and still use their body parts as the standard sequence/number 
system.

II. Tally Marks on Bones and Other Surfaces
One of the oldest methods of number representation is by making 
notches — marks cut on a surface such as a bone or a wall of a cave. 
These marks are also called tally marks. 
In this method, a mark is made for each object that is being counted. 
So the final collection of marks represents the total number of objects. This 
method is very similar to the method of using sticks to count (Method 1), 
except for the fact that a mark is made instead of adding a stick.
Archaeologists have discovered bones dating back more than 20,000 
years that seem to have tally marks. The oldest known such bones with 
markings that are thought to represent numbers are the Ishango bone 
and the Lebombo bone. The Ishango bone, dating back 20,000 to 35,000 
years, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It features 
notches arranged in columns, possibly indicating calendrical systems. 
The Lebombo bone, discovered in South Africa, is an even older tally 
stick with 29 notches, estimated to be around 44,000 years old. It is 
considered one of the oldest mathematical artefacts, and may have 
served as a tally stick or lunar calendar.

III. Number Names Obtained by Counting in Twos
A group of indigenous people in Australia called the Gumulgal had the 
following words for their numbers.
Can you see how their number names are formed?
The number name for 3 is composed of number names of 2 and 1.
The number name for 4 is composed of two occurrences of the number 
name for 2.
Can you see how the names of the other numbers are formed?
The numbers are counted in 2s, using which the number names are 
formed: 3 = 2 + 1, 4 = 2 + 2, 5 = 2 + 2 + 1, 6 = 2 + 2 + 2.
Gumulgal called any number greater than 6 ras. 
There is a very interesting and puzzling historical phenomenon 
associated with this number system. Look at the following number 
systems of a group of indigenous people in South America, and the 
Bushmen of South Africa:

A Story of Numbers
Despite being so far apart geographically, and with no trace of contact 
between them, these three groups have developed equivalent number 
systems! Historians have wondered how this happened. One theory is 
that these three groups of people may have had common ancestors, who 
used this number system. In course of time, their descendants migrated 
to these places. 
Even though the number system of Gumulgal had number names for 
numbers only till 6, we can see the emergence of an idea here. Counting 
in 2s is more efficient for representing numbers than, for example, a tally 
system. A general form which this idea has taken in different number 
systems is as follows: count in groups of a certain number (like 2 in the 
case of Gumulgal’s system), and use the word or symbol associated with 
this group size to represent bigger numbers. Some of the commonly 
used group sizes in different number systems have been 2, 5, 10 and 20.
You can find the idea of counting by 5s in the Roman system (Table 1).
One of the phenomena that could have led people to this idea might 
be the human limit for immediately knowing the size of a collection at a 
glance. Let us try out the following activity.
Quickly count the number of objects in each of the following boxes: 
Up to what group size could you immediately see the number of 
objects without counting? Most humans find it difficult to count groups 
having 5 or more objects in a single glance.
This limit of perception could have prompted people using tally 
marks to replace every group of, say, 5 marks, with a new symbol, 
as seen in the system shown in Table 1.
This idea of counting in a certain group size and using it to represent 
numbers is an important idea in the history of the evolution of 
number systems.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
What could be the difficulties with using a number system that counts 
only in groups of a single particular size? How would you represent a 
number like 1345 in a system that counts only by 5s?
Even though counting in groups of a particular size and using it for 
number representation is more efficient than the tally system, this 
method can still become cumbersome for larger numbers. The next 
system shows a refinement of this idea.
IV. The Roman Numerals
We have already seen the Roman number system till 20 (Table 1). We 
have seen that it uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10.
To get the Roman numeral for any number till 39, it is first grouped 
into as many 10s as possible, the remaining is grouped into as many 5s 
as possible, and finally the remaining is grouped into 1s. 
Example: Let us take the number 27.
27 = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1
So, 27 in Roman numerals is XXVII.
Instead of representing 50 as XXXXX, a new symbol is given to it: L. 
Following the way the number 4 is represented as 1 less than 5 — that 
is, as IV — 40 is represented as 10 less than 50 — that is, as XL. However, 
people using this system were not always consistent with this practice. 
Sometimes, 40 was also represented as XXXX.
The Roman number system introduces newer symbols to represent 
certain bigger numbers. Let us call all these numbers that have a new 
basic symbol as landmark numbers. Here are some of the landmark 
numbers of the Roman system and their associated numerals.
I
V
X
L
C
D

50
500
1,000
A Story of Numbers
These symbols are used to denote other numbers as well. For example, 
consider the number 2367. Writing it as a sum of landmark numbers 
starting from 1000 such that we take as many 1000s as possible, 500s as 
possible, and so on, we get
2367 = 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 50 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1
So in Roman numerals, this number is MMCCCLXII.
Figure it Out
1.	 Represent the following numbers in the Roman system.
(i) 1222      (ii) 2999      (iii) 302      (iv) 715
We see how vastly efficient this system is compared to some of the 
previous number systems that we have seen. This system seems to have 
evolved out of the ancient Greek number system in around the 8th 
century BCE in Rome, and evolved over time. It spread throughout 
Europe with the expansion of the Roman empire.
Despite the relative efficiency of the Roman system, it doesn’t lend 
itself to an easy performance of arithmetic operations, particularly 
multiplication and division.
Example: Try adding the following numbers without converting them 
to Hindu numerals:
(a)	 CCXXXII + CCCCXIII
Let us find the total number of Is, Xs, and Cs, and group them 
starting from the largest landmark number.
Apparently, it looks like the largest landmark number is C, but 
note that 5 Cs (100s) make a D (500). So the sum is
The efficiency of this system is due to the grouping of a given number 
by not just one group size, but a sequence of group sizes that we 
call landmark numbers, and then using these landmark numbers 
to represent the given number. This idea is the next important 
breakthrough in the history of the evolution of number systems.

Do it yourself now:
(b)	 LXXXVII + LXXVIII
How will you multiply two numbers given in Roman numerals, 
without converting them to Hindu numerals? Try to find the product 
of the following pairs of landmark numbers: V × L, L × D, V × D, 
VII × IX.
Multiply 
CCXXXI and 
MDCCCLII
People using the Roman system made use of a calculating tool called 
the abacus to perform their arithmetic operations. We will see what it 
is in a later section. However, only specially trained people used this tool 
for calculation. 
While going through the number systems discussed above, it should 
not be understood that, historically, one system developed as an 
improvement over the previous system. This point should be kept in 
mind when studying the upcoming number systems too. The actual story 
of how each of the number systems developed is much more complex, 
and many times not clearly known, and so we will not try to trace this 
in the chapter.

3.3 The Idea of a Base
I. The Egyptian Number System
We are now going to see a written number system that the Egyptians 
developed around 3000 BCE. In this system, we see the use of landmark 
numbers to group and represent a given number. However, what makes 
this system special is its sequence of landmark numbers.
Imagine making collections of pebbles. The first landmark number 
is 1. Group together 10 collections of the previous landmark number (1). 
Its size is the second landmark number which is 10. Group together 10 
collections of the previous landmark number (10). Its size is the third 
landmark number which is 10 × 10 = 100, and so on.

Each landmark number is 10 times the previous one. Since 1 is the 
first landmark number, they are all powers of 10. The following are the 
symbols given to these numbers —
As in the case of Roman numbers, a given number is counted in groups 
of the landmark numbers, starting from the largest landmark number 
less than the given number. This is then used to assign the numeral.
For example 324 which equals 100 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 10 + 4 is written 
as 
.

1023, 2660, 784, 1111, 70707.
2.	 What numbers do these numerals stand for?
II. Variations on the Egyptian System and the Notion of 
Base
Instead of grouping together 10 collections of size equal to the previous 
landmark number (as in the case of the Egyptian system), can we get 
a number system by grouping together 5 collections of size equal to 
the previous landmark number? Can this 5 be replaced by any positive 
integer?
Let us examine this possibility. Let 1 be the first landmark number.
Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark 
number (1). Its size is the second landmark number which is 5.
Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark 
number (5). Its size is the third landmark number which is 5 × 5 = 25.
Group together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark 
number (5). Its size is the fourth landmark number which is 5 × 25 = 125.
(i)
(ii)
A Story of Numbers
Thus, we have a new number system where each landmark number 
is 5 times the previous one. Since 1 is the first landmark number, they 
are all powers of 5.
50 = 1            51 = 5            52 = 25          53 = 125          54 = 625          55 = 3125
Express the number 143 in this new system.
Let us start grouping, starting with the size 53 = 125, as this is the 
largest landmark number smaller than 143. We get—
143 = 125 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1.
So the number 143 in the new system is 
.
Number systems having landmark numbers in which the 
(a)	 first landmark number is 1, and
(b)	 every next landmark number is obtained by multiplying the 
current landmark number by some fixed number n is said to 
be a base-n number system.
The Egyptian number system is a base-10 system, and the number 
system that we created is a base-5 system. A base-10 number system is 
also called a decimal number system.

1.	 Write the following numbers in the above base-5 system using the 
symbols in Table 2: 15, 50, 137, 293, 651.
2.	 Is there a number that cannot be represented in our base-5 system 
above? Why or why not?
3.	 Compute the landmark numbers of a base-7 system. In general, what 
are the landmark numbers of a base-n system?
The landmark numbers of a base-n number system are the powers of 
n starting from n0 = 1, n, n2, n3,...

Advantages of a Base-n System
What is the advantage of having landmark numbers that are all the 
powers of a number? To understand this, let us perform some arithmetic 
operations using them.
Example: Add the following Egyptian numerals:
Let us find the total number of | and  and group them starting from 
the largest possible landmark number. It has a total of—
15  and 15 |.
Since 10  gives the next landmark number , the sum can be regrouped 
as—

Contrast the addition done in a base-n number system with that 
done in the Roman system. In the Roman system, the grouping and 
rearranging has to be done carefully as it is not always by the same size 
that each landmark number has to be grouped to get the next one.
The advantage of a number system with a base becomes more evident 
when we consider multiplication.

1. 	 What is any landmark number multiplied by  (that is 10)? Find the

What would be a simple rule to multiply a number with ?
As has been seen, a process of multiplying two numbers involves the 
multiplication of landmark numbers. When the landmark numbers are 
powers of a number, then their product is another landmark number. 
This fact simplifies the process of multiplication. However, this is not the 
case with the Roman numerals, which is why multiplication using them 
is difficult.
Thus, a number system whose landmark numbers are powers of 
a number, i.e., a number system with a base, is efficient not only in 
number representation but also in its utility in carrying out arithmetic 
operations.
The idea of a number system with a base was a turning point in the 
history of the evolution of number systems. Our modern Hindu number 
system is built on this structure.
Abacus that Makes Use of the Decimal System
In around the 11th century, even the people still using the Roman 
numerals started using a calculating device — the abacus — constructed 
using a decimal system. It was a board with lines, as shown in the Fig. 3.1. 
Starting from the line that stood for 1, each successive line stood for a 
successive power of 10. 
Numbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was 
first grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the 
same way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as 
many counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred 
Fig. 3.1: Abacus
A Story of Numbers
in the grouping. The presence of a counter above a line contributed a 
value of 5. 
For example let us take the number 3426. It can be grouped as 
3426 = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 10+ 1 + 1 + 
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
This number was represented as shown in Fig. 3.1. Notice how the 
6 ones are represented.
To get an idea of how the abacus was used for calculations, let us 
consider a simple addition problem: 2907 + 43. The two numbers were 
taken on either side of the vertical partition. 
How would you use this to find the sum?
The counters along each line were brought together. What is to be 
done if the total in a line exceeded 10? 
Hint: In this problem, the 7 ones and the 3 ones together make 10 ones 
which contributes a counter to the line representing 10s.
III. Shortcomings of the Egyptian System
Despite being a number system that enabled relatively efficient number 
representations for numbers till a crore (107), and relatively easy 
computations, the Egyptian system had a drawback.
If larger and larger numbers needed to be represented, then there 
was a need for inventing an unending sequence of symbols for higher 
and higher powers of 10. Here we see the original challenge of number 
representation resurfacing in a different form!
The next and the final idea in the history of the evolution of number 
systems not only solves this problem but also remarkably simplifies 
number representation and computations!

3.4. Place Value Representation
I. The Mesopotamian Number System
In the beginning, the number system used in ancient Mesopotamia had 
different symbols for different landmark numbers. In later times, it 
became a base-60 system, also called the sexagesimal system, with a 
very efficient number representation.
It has puzzled many why they chose base 60. Different theories exist to 
explain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of 
some important events (like the length of their lunar month which had 
30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution around 
the Earth when Earth is taken to be stationary), the ease of representing 
fractions (we will not go into this here), their earlier sequence of 
landmark numbers — 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, 36000,… — getting reduced to 
only the powers of 60, and so on.
The influence of the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system, also known 
as the Babylonian number system, can be seen even now in our units 
of time measurements — 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds.
This system used the symbol  for 1 and 
 for 10.
Let us now briefly pause on the study of their number system, and 
ideate on how one can build an efficient number system using the 
Mesopotamian features seen so far.

A Story of Numbers
Let us give our own symbols to their landmark numbers —
Note that we have actually used Indian numerals in creating these 
symbols. We could have invented our own symbols but for the sake of 
easy recall and use, we have chosen to take help of the familiar numerals 
1, 2, 3, ...
Using  and 
, numbers from 1 to 59 can be represented —
Example: Let us represent the number 640 in this system.
Grouping it into landmark numbers, we see that
640 = (10) × 60 + 40.
If we use the Egyptian idea, this number would be represented using 
10 
1 s, and 40 would be represented using 4 
s.

Can we represent this more compactly?
We can simply represent this number as
which can be read as ten 60s and one 40, just as we have written in the 
equation.
Example: Let us try another number — 7530.
7530 = (2) ×3600 + (5) × 60 + 30
So, its representation would be
Note that when a number is grouped into powers of 60 for its 
representation, no power of 60 can occur 60 or more times. If this 
happens, then 60 of them can be grouped to form the next power of 60. 
For example, consider the expression —
(1) × 3600 + (70) × 60 + 2	 = (1) × 602 + (60 + 10) × 60 + 2
	
	
	
	
	
= (1) × 602 + 602 + (10) × 60 + 2
	
	
	
	
	
= (2) × 602 + (10) × 60 + 2
Therefore, any number can be represented using the numerals from 
1 – 59, along with the numerals for landmark numbers.
Now, what if we make the representation even more compact by 
dropping the symbols for the different powers of 60 altogether?
A Story of Numbers
This is exactly what the Mesopotamians did! In their numeral, the 
rightmost set of symbols showed the number of 1s, the set of symbols to 
its left showed the number of 60s, the next showed the number of 3600s 
and so on. Whenever there was no occurrence of a power of 60, a blank 
space was given in that position.
It does not seem that the Mesopotamians arrived at this idea in the 
same way we did. Some scholars suggest that the similarity of symbols 
given to the landmark numbers 1 and 60 in their earlier number system, 
and an accidental usage of them, might have made them stumble upon 
this idea.
Figure it Out
1.	 Represent the following numbers in the Mesopotamian system —
(i) 63    (ii) 132    (iii) 200    (iv) 60    (v) 3605
Thus, we can see how the Mesopotamian system removes the need for 
generating an unending sequence of symbols for the landmark numbers 
by making use of the positions where the symbols are written. Such a 
number system (having a base) that makes use of the position of each 
symbol in determining the landmark number that it is associated with is 
called a positional number system or a place value system.
This idea of place value marks the highest point in the history of 
evolution of number systems, and gives a very elegant solution to the 
problem of representing the unending sequence of numbers using only 
a finite number of different symbols!
The Mesopotamian system however cannot be considered a fully 
developed place value system. It has certain defects that lead to confusion 
while reading a number.
Look at the representation of 60. What will be the representation for 
3,600?
While writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not 
given the way we are giving it here. It was also difficult to maintain a 
consistent spacing for blanks across different manuscripts written by 
different people. These created ambiguities. For example, consider the 
representations of the following numbers —
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
Because of the ambiguity in finding which symbols correspond to 
which powers of 60, the same numeral can be read in different ways. 
Even in our representation which uses uniform spacing between 
symbols for different powers of 60, it is difficult to know the number of 
blanks between two sets of symbols, as in the representation of 36002. 
To address the issue arising out of blank spaces, the later 
Mesopotamians used a brilliant idea of assigning a ‘placeholder’ symbol 
 to denote a blank space. This is like the 0 (zero) we use in our system. 
Thus, zero — the symbol that shows nothingness — is indispensable as a 
placeholder in a place value system in which numbers are written in an 
unambiguous manner. 
Even with the problem arising out of blank spaces solved, other 
ambiguities still remained in the system. For example, the placeholder 
symbol was primarily used in the middle of numbers and not at the 
end; so they would not use it to represent a number like (what we would 
write as) 3600.
II. The Mayan Number System
In Central America, there flourished a civilisation known as the Mayan 
civilisation that made great intellectual and cultural progress between 
the 3rd and 10th centuries CE. Among their intellectual achievements 
stands their place value system designed independently of those in Asia. 
They also made use of a placeholder symbol, for the modern-day ‘0’, that 
looked like a seashell.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
Here we find a puzzling phenomenon. Why was their third landmark 
number 360 rather than 400? Some scholars feel that this might have 
something to do with their calendars.
They used a dot 
 for 1, and a bar 
 for 5. These were used to 
denote numbers from 1 to 19. 
The symbols associated with different landmark numbers were 
written one below the other with the lowermost set of symbols 
corresponding to the number of 1s, the set above corresponding to the 
number of 20s, the set above to the number of 360s and so on. 
Represent the following numbers using the Mayan system:
(i) 77    (ii) 100    (iii) 361    (iv) 721
Because the Mayan system is not an actual base-20 system, it lacks the 
advantages that a system with a base has for computations. Nevertheless, 
their place value notation and their use of a placeholder symbol for zero 
is considered an important advance in the history of number systems. 
A curious fact is that we can still find the use of base-20 in the number 
names of some European languages.
III. The Chinese Number System
The Chinese used two number systems — a written system for recording 
quantities, and a system making use of rods for performing computations. 
The numerals in the rod-based number system are called rod numerals. 
Here we discuss the rod numerals, which are more efficient in writing 
and computing with numbers than the written system of the Chinese. 
The rod numerals developed in China by at least by 3rd century AD 
and were used till the 17th century. It was a decimal system (base-10). 
The symbols for 1 to 9 were as follows:

Like the Mesopotamians, the rod numerals used a blank space to 
indicate the skipping of a place value. However, because of the slightly 
more uniform sizes of the symbols for one through nine, the blank 
spaces were easier to locate than in the Mesopotamian system. 
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
Notice how similar the rod numerals are to the Hindu system. 
The Chinese system, with a symbol for zero, would be a fully developed 
place value system. 
IV. The Hindu Number System
Where does the Hindu/Indian number system figure in the evolution of 
ideas of number representation? What are its landmark numbers? And 
does it use a place value system?

As can be seen, the Hindu number system is a place value system. 
The Hindu number system has had a symbol for 0 at least as early as 
200 BCE. Because of the use of 0 as a digit, and the use of a single digit in 
each position, this system does not lead to any kind of ambiguity when 
A Story of Numbers
reading or writing numerals. It is for this reason that the Hindu number 
system is now used throughout the world. 
The use of 0 as a digit, and indeed as a number, was a breakthrough 
that truly changed the world of mathematics and science. In Indian 
mathematics, indeed, zero was not just used as a placeholder in the place 
value system, but was also given the status of a number in its own right, 
on par with other numbers. The arithmetic properties of the number 0 
(e.g., that 0 plus any number is the same number, and that 0 times any 
number is zero) were explicitly used by Aryabhata in his Āryabhaṭīya in 
499 CE to compute with and do elaborate scientific computations using 
Hindu numerals. The use of 0 as a number like any other number, on 
which one can perform the basic arithmetic operations, was codified 
by Brahmagupta in his work Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE, as we 
learned in an earlier grade.  
By introducing 0 as a number, along with the negative numbers, 
Brahmagupta created what in modern terms is called a ring, i.e., a set of 
numbers that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication 
(i.e., any two numbers in the set can be added, subtracted, or multiplied 
to get another number in that set).  These new ideas laid the foundations 
for modern mathematics, and particularly for the areas of algebra and 
analysis.  
Hopefully, this gives you a sense of all the ideas that went into writing 
and computing with numbers in the way that we do today.  The discovery 
of 0 and the resulting Indian number system is truly one of the greatest, 
most creative, and most influential inventions of all time — appearing 
constantly in our daily lives and forming the basis of much of modern 
science, technology, computing, accounting, surveying, and more. The 
next time you are writing numbers, think about the incredible history 
behind them and all the deep ideas that went into their discovery!

look like if we were using base 8 instead? Base 5? Try writing the 
base-10 Hindu numeral 25 as base-8 and base-5 Hindu numerals, 
respectively. Can you write it in base-2?

To represent numbers, we need a standard sequence of objects,

In a number system, landmark numbers are numbers that

The system of numerals that we use throughout the world today 
is the Hindu number system (also sometimes called the Indian 
number system, or the Hindu-Arabic number system). It is a 
place value system with (usually) 10 digits, including the digit 
0 which is treated on par with other digits. Due to its use of 0 
as a number, the system enables the writing of all numbers 
unambiguously using just finitely many symbols, and also 
enables efficient computation. The system originated in India 
around 2000 years ago, and then spread across the world, and 
is considered one of human history’s greatest inventions.
