MULTIPLY
We have seen how algebra makes use of letter symbols to write general 
statements about patterns and relations in a compact manner. Algebra 
can also be used to justify or prove claims and conjectures (like the many 
properties you saw in the previous chapter) and to solve problems of 
various kinds. 
Distributivity is a property relating multiplication and addition that 
is captured concisely using algebra. In this chapter, we explore different 
types of multiplication patterns and show how they can be described in 
the language of algebra by making use of distributivity.
6.1 Some Properties of Multiplication
Increments in Products
Consider the multiplication of two numbers, say, 23 × 27.
1. By how much does the product increase if the first number (23) is 
increased by 1?
2. What if the second number (27) is increased by 1?
3. How about when both numbers are increased by 1?
Do you see a pattern that could help generalise our observations to the 
product of any two numbers?
Let us first consider a simpler problem — find the increase in the 
product when 27 is increased by 1. From the definition of multiplication 
(and the commutative property), it is clear that the product increases by 
23. This can be seen from the distributive property of multiplication as 
well. If a, b and c are three numbers, then —
We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply
This is called the distributive property of multiplication over 
addition. Using the identity a (b + c) = ab + ac with a = 23, b = 27, and 
c = 1, we have
Remember that here, a (b + c) and 23 (27 + 1) mean a × (b + c), and 
23 × (27 + 1), respectively. We usually skip writing the ‘×’ symbol before 
or after brackets, just as in the case of expressions like 5a, xy, etc.
We can also similarly expand (a + b) c using the distributive property 
as follows — 
	
	
	
(a + b) c = c (a + b) (commutativity of multiplication)
	
	
	
	
     = ca + cb (distributivity)
	
	
	
	
     = ac + bc (commutativity of multiplication)
We can use the distributive property to find, in general, how much a 
product increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased 
by 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and b. If one of the numbers, 
say b, is increased by 1, then we have —
Now let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are 
increased by 1. If in a product  ab, both a and b are increased by 1, then 
we obtain (a + 1) (b + 1).
a (b + c) = ab + ac

How do we expand this?
Let us consider (a + 1) as a single term. Then, by the distributive 
property, we have
Thus, the product ab increases by a + b + 1 when each of a and b are 
increased by 1.
What would we get  if we had expanded (a + 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1) 
as a single term? Try it?
What happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1 
and the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product? 
Let us again take the product ab of two numbers a and b. If a is 
increased by 1 and b is decreased by 1, then their product will be (a + 1) 
(b – 1). Expanding this, we get
Will the product always increase? Find 3 examples where the product 
decreases.
What happens when a and b are negative integers? 
Check by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above 
cases. For example, a = –5, b = 8; a = –4, b = –5; etc.
We have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that 
is, if x, y and z are any three integers, then x (y + z) = xy + xz. 
Thus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the 
letter-numbers take on negative integer values as well.
Recall that two algebraic expressions are equal if they take on the 
same values when their letter-numbers are replaced by numbers. These 
(a + 1) (b + 1) = (a + 1) b + (a + 1) 1
	
	
	
= ab +  (b + a + 1)
Increase
(a + 1) (b + 1) = (a + 1) b + (a + 1) 1
   Again applying the distributive 
property, we obtain
(23 + 1) (27 + 1) = (23 + 1) 27 + (23 + 1) 1
	
	
	
     = 23 × 27 +  (27 + 23 + 1)
Increase
If a = 23, and, b = 27, we get
(a + 1) (b – 1) = (a + 1) b – (a + 1) 1
	
	
	
= ab +  b – (a + 1)
	
	
	
= ab +  b – a – 1
Increase
(23 + 1) (27 – 1) = (23 + 1) 27 – (23 + 1) 1
	
	
	
    = 23 × 27 + 27 – (23 + 1)
	
	
	
    = 23 × 27 +  27 – 23 – 1
Increase
If a = 23, and b = 27, we get

numbers could be any integers. Mathematical statements that express 
the equality of two algebraic expressions, such as 
a (b + 8) = ab + 8a, 
(a + 1) (b – 1) = ab + b – a – 1, etc., 
are called identities.
By how much will the product of two numbers change if one of the 
numbers is increased by m and the other by n?
If a and b are the initial numbers being multiplied, they become 
a + m and b + n.
(a + m) (b + n) = (a + m)b + (a + m)n
                          = ab + mb + an + mn
The increase is an + bm + mn.
Notice that the product is the sum of the product of each term of 
(a + m) with each term of (b + n).
This identity can be visualised as follows —
(a + m) (b + n) = ab + mb + an + mn

This identity can be used to find how products change when the numbers 
being multiplied are increased or decreased by any amount. Can you see 
how this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased?
For example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased 
by 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b – 1) 
as (a + 1) (b + (–1). Taking m = 1 and n = –1 in Identity 1, we have 
ab + (1) × b + a × (–1) + (1) × (–1) = ab + b – a – 1,
which is the same expression that we obtain earlier. 
Use Identity 1 to find how the product changes when 
(i)	 one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3;
(ii)	 both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4.  
Verify the answers by finding the products without converting the 
subtractions to additions.
Generalising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b – v) as follows.
(a + u) (b – v) = (a + u) b – (a + u) v
                        = ab + ub – (av + uv)
                        = ab + ub – av – uv.
Check that this is the same as taking m = u and n = –v in Identity 1.
As in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b – v) is the sum of the product of 
each term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b – v (b and (–v)). Notice 
that the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the 
usual rules of integer multiplication.
Expand (i) (a – u) (b + v), (ii) (a – u) (b – v).
We get
        (a – u) (b + v) = ab – ub + av – uv, and
(a – u) (b – v) = ab – ub – av + uv.
The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket.
Example 1: Expand 3a
2  (a – b + 1
5).
3a
2  (a – b + 1
5) = (3a
2  × a) – (3a
2  × b) + (3a
2  × 1
5 ).
The terms can be simplified as follows —
3a
2  × a = 3
2 × (a × a).
See how the rules of integer multiplication allows us to handle 
multiple cases using a single identity!
We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply
Using exponent notation, we can write 3
2 × (a × a) = 3
2 a2.
3a
2  × b = 3
2 × (a × b) = 3
2 ab.
3a
2  × 1
5 = (3
2 × 1
5) a = 3
10 a
So we get
3a
2  (a – b + 1
5) = 3
2a2 – 3
2 ab + 3
10 a.
Can any two terms be added to get a single term?
For example, can 3
2 a2 and 3
10 a be added to get a single term?
We see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers, 
which would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So, 
a further simplification of the expression is not possible. 
Recall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms.
Example 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b). 
We have (a + b) (a + b) = (a+b) a + (a + b)b = a × a + b × a + ab + b × b 
	 	
	
	
	
   	
	
   = a2 + ba + ab + b2
Since ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab 
(or, that are like terms), and so can be added —
ba + ab = ab + ab = 2ab
So we get
(a + b) (a + b) = a2 + 2ab + b2.
Example 3: Expand (a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2).
(a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2) = (a + b)a2 + (a + b) × 2ab + (a + b)b2
	
	
	
	
     = (a × a2) + ba2 + (a × 2ab) + (b × 2ab) + ab2 + (b × b2)
The terms can be simplified as follows —
a × a2 = a3 (why?)
ba2 = a2b
a × 2ab = 2 × a × a × b = 2a2b
 b × 2ab = 2 × a × b × b = 2ab2
b × b2 = b3
So, (a + b)(a2 + 2ab + b2) = a3 + a2b + 2a2b + 2ab2 + ab2 + b3.
We see that a2b and 2a2b have the same letter-numbers (or, are like 
terms) and so can be added —
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
a2b + 2a2b = (1 + 2) a2 b = 3a2 b.
Similarly, ab2 and 2ab2 are like terms and so can be added —
ab2 + 2ab2 = (1 + 2)ab2 = 3ab2.
Thus, we have
(a + b) × (a2 + 2ab +b2 ) = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3.
A Pinch of History
The distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit 
in the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations, 
particularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For 
example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Āryabhaṭa 
(in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner 
extensively in their mathematical and scientific works.  The first explicit 
statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his 
work Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of 
the property for multiplication as khaṇḍa-guṇanam (multiplication by 
parts). His verse states, “The multiplier is broken up into two or more 
parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by 
each of these and the results added”. That is, if there are two parts, then 
using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c = ac + bc. In 
the next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method 
for doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we 
explore further in the next section.

6.2 Special Cases of the Distributive Property
Square of the Sum/Difference of Two Numbers
The area of a square of sidelength 60 units is 3600 sq. units (602) and that 
of a square of sidelength 5 units is 25 sq. units (52). Can we use this to 
find the area of a square of sidelength 65 units?
A square of sidelength 65 can be split into 4 regions as shown in the 
figure — a square of sidelength 60, a square of sidelength 5, and two 
rectangles of sidelengths 60 and 5. The area of the square of sidelength 65 
is the sum of the areas of all its constituent parts. Can you find the areas 
of the four parts in the figure above?
We get
652 = (60 + 5)2 = 602 + 52 + 2 × (60 × 5).
	
	
	
 = 3600 + 25 + 600 = 4225 sq. units.
Let us multiply (60 + 5) × (60 + 5) using the 
distributive property.
(60 + 5) × (60 + 5) = 60 × 60 + 5 × 60 + 60 × 5 + 5 × 5
	
        = 602 + 2 × (60 × 5) + 52.
What if we write 652 as (30 + 35)2 or (52 + 13)2? 
Draw the figures and check the area that you get.
Let us look at the general expression for the 
square of sum of two numbers, (a + b)2.
If a and b are any two integers, is (a + b)2 always greater than 
a2 + b2? If not, when is it greater?

Can we use 602 (=3600) and 52 (=25) to find the value of (60 – 5)2 or 552? 
Let us approach this through geometry by drawing a square of side 
length 55 sitting inside a square of sidelength 60.
Area of a square of sidelength 55 is (60 – 5)2 = 552.
Using the Distributive Property
Using the Identity
(6x + 5)2	 = (6x + 5) (6x + 5)
	
	
= (6x × 6x) + (5 × 6x) +(6x × 5) + 5 × 5
	
	
= (6x)2 + 2 (6x × 5) + 52
	
	
= 36x2 + 60x + 25.
(6x + 5)2	 = (6x)2 + 52 + 2 × (6x × 5)
	
	
= 36x2 + 25 + 60x.
If you have difficulty remembering or using the general rule, you 
can just apply the distributive property to multiply and get the 
desired result.

sidelengths 60 and 5, i.e., 
602 – (60 × 5) – (5 × 60). 
By doing this, we remove the 
area of the small square of 
sidelength 5 twice. What can 
we do with this expression to 
get the actual area?
	
We can add back the area 
of the square of sidelength 5 
to this expression. That way, 
we are only subtracting this 
area once.

(60 – 5)2 = 602 – (60 × 5) – (5 × 60) + 52
= 3600 – 300 – 300 + 25
= 3025.
The area of the square of sidelength 55 is 3025 sq. units.
We have seen what (a + b)2 gives when expanded. What is the 
expansion of (a – b)2? 
Using the distributive property,
(a – b)2 = (a – b) × (a – b)
= (a)2 – ba – ab + (b)
= a2 – 2ab + b2.
We can also use the expansion of (a + b)2 to find the expansion of 
(a – b)2. Think how.
Hint: (a – b)2 = (a + (–b))2.
We can now directly use the expansion of (a + b)2.
(a + (–b)2  = (a)2  + (–b)2 + 2 × (a) × (–b)
Find the general expansion of (a – b)2 using geometry, as we did for 552.
Use the identity (a – b)2 to find the values of (a) 992 and (b) 582.

distributive property

Investigating Patterns
Pattern 1
Look at the following pattern.
2 (22 + 12) = 32 + 12
2 (32 + 12) = 42 + 22
   2 (62 + 52) = 112 + 12
  2 (52 + 32) =  82 + 22.
Identity 1B     (a – b)2 = a2 + b2 – 2ab

Take a pair of natural numbers. Calculate the sum of their squares. 
Can you write twice this sum as a sum of two  squares?
Try this with other pairs of numbers. Have you figured out a pattern?
Notice that 2 (52 + 62) =  (6 + 5)2 + (6 – 5)2.
Do the identities below help in explaining the observed pattern?
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a – b)2 = a2 – 2ab + b2
(a + b)2 + (a – b)2 = (a2 + 2ab + b2) + (a2 – 2ab + b2)
Adding the like terms a2 + a2  = 2a2 , b2 + b2 = 2b2 and 2ab – 2ab = 0, 
we get  
2 (a2 + b2) = (a + b)2 + (a – b)2.
Pattern 2
Here is a related pattern. Try to describe the pattern using algebra to 
determine if the pattern always holds.
9 × 9 – 1 × 1= 10 × 8
8 × 8 – 6 × 6 = 14 × 2
7 × 7 – 2 × 2 = 9 × 5
10 × 10 – 4 × 4 = 14 × 6
The pattern here appears to be a2 – b2 = (a + b) × (a – b).
Is this a true identity? Using the distributive property, we get
(a + b) × (a – b) = a2 – ab + ba – a2.
Adding the like terms, ab + (–ab) = 0, we see that indeed
You had seen this identity earlier in Figure it Out 5 (i). 
Use Identity 1C to calculate 98 × 102, and 45 × 55.
Show that (a + b) × (a – b) = a2 – b2 geometrically.
Identity 1C      (a + b) × (a – b) = a2 – b2.

Hint:
Sridharacharya (750 CE) gave an interesting method to quickly 
compute the squares of numbers using Identity 1C! Consider the 
following modified form of this identity —
a2 = (a + b) (a – b) + b2
Why is this identity true?
Now, for example, 312 can be found by taking a = 31 and b = 1.
                     312  = (31 + 1) (31 – 1) + 12
            = 32 × 30 + 1
= 961.
    1972 can be found by taking a = 197, and b = 3.
                    1972  = (197 + 3) (197 – 3) + 32
             = 200 × 194 + 9
 = 38809.

Observe the pattern in the figure below. Draw the next figure in the 
sequence. How many circles does it have? How many total circles 
are there in Step 10? Write an expression for the number of circles 
in Step k. 
There are many ways of interpreting this pattern. Here are some 
possibilities:
   –3p (–5p + 2q)
= –3p + 5p – 2q
= p – 2q
   2(x – 1) + 3 (x + 4)

= 5x + 3
   y + 2 (y + 2)
= (y + 2)2
= y2 + 4y + 4
   (5m + 6n)2
= 25m2 + 36n2
   (– q + 2)2
= q2 – 4q + 4
   3a (2b × 3c)

   + 6ab2
= 5a3 + 12a2b2
   (a + 2) (b + 4)
= ab + 8
   ab2 + a2b + a2b2
= ab (a + b + ab)
    (x + 2)(x + 5)
= (x + 2)x + (x + 2)5
= x2 + 2x + 5x +10
= x2 + 7x + 10

Does your method match any of these, or is it different? Each 
expression that we have identified appears different, but are they really 
different? Since they describe the same pattern, they should all be the 
same. Let us simplify each expression and find out.
When carried out correctly, all methods lead to the same answer; 
k2 + 2k. The expression k2 + 2k gives the number of circles at Step k of this 
pattern.
Use this formula to find the number of circles in Step 15.
Consider the pattern made of square tiles in the picture below.
         (k + 1)2 – 1  
= k2 + 1 + 2k – 1
= k2 + 2k
k2 + 2 × k
= k2 + 2k
k × (k + 1) + k
    = k2 + k + k
        = k2 + 2k
  k × (k + 2)
= k2 + 2k
In Mathematics, there are often multiple ways of looking at 
a pattern, and different ways of approaching and solving the 
same problem. Finding such ways often requires a great deal 
of creativity and imagination! While one or two of the ways 
might be your favourite(s), it can be amusing and enriching to 
explore other ways as well.

Find the area of the (interior) shaded region in the figure below. All four 
rectangles have the same dimensions.
Tadang’s method: 
The total region is a square of side (m + n) with an area 
(m + n)2.
Subtracting the area of four rectangles from the total 
area will give the area of the interior shaded region.
That is, (m + n)2 – 4mn .
Yusuf’s method:
The shaded region is a square with sidelength (n – m). So, 
its area is (n – m)2.
By expanding both expressions, 
check that (m + n)2– 4mn = (n – m)2. 
Find out the area of the region with slanting lines in the 
figure. All three rectangles have the same dimensions 
(Fig. 1).
Anusha’s method:
Required area = Area (ABCD) – Area (EFGH)
Area of ABCD = x2.
Area of EFGH = xy.
Required area = x2 – xy.
Vaishnavi’s method:
QS = y + x + y 
	
= x + 2y.
Area of PQSR = x (x + 2y)
Required area = Area of PQSR – (area of the three 
rectangles)
                              = x (x + 2y) – 3xy.

SUMMARY
Coin Conjoin
Arrange 10 coins in a triangle as shown in the figure below on the left. 
The task is to turn the triangle upside down by moving one coin at a 
time. How many moves are needed? What is the minimum number of 
moves? 
A triangle of 3 coins can be inverted (turned upside down) with a 
single move, and a triangle of 6 coins can be inverted by moving 2 coins. 
The 10-coin triangle can be flipped with just 3 moves; did you figure 
out how? Find out the minimum possible moves needed to flip the 
next bigger triangle having 15 coins. Try the same for bigger triangular 
numbers.
Is there a simple way to calculate the minimum number of coin moves 
needed for any such triangular arrangement?
