7.1 Observing Similarity in Change
We are all familiar with digital images. We often change the size and 
orientation of these images to suit our needs. Observe the set of images 
below —
We can see that all the images are of different sizes.
Which images look similar and which ones look different?
Images (A, C, and D) look similar, even though they have different sizes.

Do images B and E look like the other three images?
No, they are slightly distorted. The tiger appears elongated in B, and
compressed and fatter in E!
Why?
You may notice that images A, C, and D are rectangular, but E is 
square. Maybe that is why E looks different. But B is also a rectangle! 
Why does it look different from the other rectangular images? 
Can we observe any pattern to answer this question? Perhaps by 
measuring the rectangles?

What makes images A, C, and D appear similar, and B and E different?
When we compare image A with C, we notice that the width of C is 
half that of A. The height is also half of A. Both the width and height 
have changed by the same factor (through multiplication), 1
2 in this 
case. Since the widths and heights have changed by the same factor, the 
images look similar.
When we compare image A with image B, we notice that the width of 
B is 20 millimetre (mm) less than that of A. The height too is 20 mm less 
than the height of A. Even though the difference (through subtraction) is 
the same, the images look different. Have the width and height changed 
by the same factor? The height of B is half the height of A. But the width of 
B is not half the width of A. Since the width and height have not changed 
by the same factor, the images look different.
Can you check by what factors the width and height of image D change 
as compared to image A? Are the factors the same?
Images A, C, and D look similar because their widths and heights have 
changed by the same factor. We say that the changes to their widths and 
heights are proportional.

Proportional Reasoning-1
7.2 Ratios
We use the notion of a ratio to represent such proportional relationships 
in mathematics.
We can say that the ratio of width to height of image A is
60 : 40.
The numbers 60 and 40 are called the terms of the ratio.
The ratio of width to height of image C is 30 : 20, and that of image D 
is 90 : 60.
In a ratio of the form a : b, we can say that for every ‘a’ units of the 
first quantity, there are ‘b’ units of the second quantity.
So, in image A, we can say that for every 60 mm of width, there are 40 
mm of height.
We can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D 
are proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same 
factor. Let us see how.
Image A — 60 : 40
Multiplying both the terms by 1
2, we get
60 × 1
2 : 40 × 1
2 
which is 30 : 20, the ratio of width to height in image C.
By what factor should we multiply the ratio 60 : 40 (image A) to get 90 : 60 
(image D)?
A more systematic way to compare whether the ratios are proportional 
is to reduce them to their simplest form and see if these simplest forms 
are the same.
7.3 Ratios in their Simplest Form
We can reduce ratios to their simplest form by dividing the terms by 
their HCF.
In image A, the terms are 60 and 40. What is the HCF of 60 and 40? It 
is 20. Dividing the terms by 20, we get the ratio of image A to be 3 : 2 in 
its simplest form.
The ratio of image D is 90 : 60. Dividing both terms by 30 (HCF 
of 90 and 60), we get the simplest form to be 3 : 2. So the ratios of 
images A and D are proportional as well.
What is the simplest form of the ratios of images B and E?
The ratio of image B is 40 : 20; in its simplest form, it is 2 : 1.
The ratio of image E is 60 : 60; in its simplest form, it is 1 : 1.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
These ratios are not the same as 3 : 2. So, we can say that the ratios of 
width to height of images B and E are not proportional to the ratios of 
images A, C, and D.
When two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the 
ratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use 
the ‘::’ symbol to indicate that they are proportional.
So a : b :: c : d indicates that the ratios a : b and c : d are proportional.
Thus, 
60 : 40 :: 30 : 20 and 60 : 40 :: 90 : 60.
7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning
Example 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72 : 96 proportional?
3 : 4 is already in its simplest form.
To find the simplest form of 72 : 96, we need to divide both terms by 
their HCF.
What is the HCF of 72 and 96?
The HCF of 72 and 96 is 24. Dividing both terms by 24, we get 3 : 4.
Since both ratios in their simplest form are the same, they are proportional.
Example 2: Kesang wanted to make lemonade for a celebration. She 
made 6 glasses of lemonade in a vessel and added 10 spoons of sugar to 
the drink. Her father expected more people to join the celebration. So he 
asked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade. 
To make the lemonade with the same sweetness, how many spoons of 
sugar should she add? 
To maintain the same sweetness, the ratio of 
the number of glasses of lemonade to the number 
of spoons of sugar should be proportional. For 6 
glasses of lemonade, she added 10 spoons of sugar. 
The ratio of glasses of lemonade to spoons of 
sugar is 6 : 10. If she needs to make 18 more glasses 
of lemonade, how many spoons of sugar should 
she use? We can model this problem as —
6 : 10 :: 18 : ?
We know that each term in the ratio must change 
by the same factor, for the ratios to be proportional.
How can we find the factor of change in the ratio?
The first term has increased from 6 to 18. To find the factor of change, 
we can divide 18 by 6 to get 3.
Proportional Reasoning-1
The second term should also change by the same factor. When 10 
increases by a factor of 3, it becomes 30. Thus,
6 : 10 :: 18 : 30.
So, she should use 30 spoons of sugar to make 18 glasses of lemonade 
with the same sweetness as earlier.
Example 3: Nitin and Hari were constructing a compound wall around 
their house. Nitin was building the longer side, 60 ft in length, and Hari was 
building the shorter side, 40 ft in length. Nitin used 3 bags of cement but 
Hari used only 2 bags of cement. Nitin was worried that the wall Hari built 
would not be as strong as the wall he built because she used less cement. 
Is Nitin correct in his thinking?
In Nitin and Hari’s case, we should compare the ratio of the length 
of the wall to the bags of cement used by each of them and see whether 
they are proportional.
The ratio in Nitin’s case is 60 : 3, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form).
The ratio in Hari’s case is 40 : 2, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form).
Since both ratios are proportional, the walls are equally strong. Nitin 
should not worry!
Example 4: In my school, there are 5 teachers and 170 students. The 
ratio of teachers to students in my school is 5 : 170. Count the number 
of teachers and students in your school. What is the ratio of teachers to 
students in your school? Write it below.

Note to the Teacher: Give more such examples that students can relate to and ask 
them to give reasons why they think they are correct. Engaging with these problems 
and finding solutions through a process of proportional reasoning should go along 
with learning procedures and methods to solve the problems.

Example 6: When Neelima was 3 years old, her mother’s age was 10 
times her age. What is the ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age? 
What would be the ratio of their ages when Neelima is 12 years old? 
Would it remain the same?
The ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age when Neelima is 3 years 
old is 3 : 30 (her mother’s age is 10 times Neelima’s age). In the simplest 
form, it is 1 : 10.
When Neelima is 12 years old (i.e., 9 years later), the ratio of their ages 
will be 12 : 39 (9 years later, her mother would be 39 years old). In the 
simplest form, it is 4 : 13.
When we add (or subtract) the same number from the terms of a ratio, 
the ratio changes and is not necessarily proportional to the original ratio.
Example 7: Fill in the missing numbers for the following ratios that are 
proportional to 14 : 21.
______ : 42      6 : ______       2 : ______
In the first ratio, we don’t know the first term. But the 
second term is 42. It is 2 times the second term of the 
ratio 14 : 21. So, the first term should also be 2 times 14 
(the first term). Hence the proportional ratio is 28 : 42.
For the second ratio, the first term is 6.
What factor should we multiply 14 by to get 6? Can it 
be an integer? Or should it be a fraction? 
We can model this as 14y = 6. So, y = 6
14 = 3
7.
So, we need to multiply 21 (the second term of 14 : 21) also by the 
same factor 3
7. 
21 × 3
7 is 9. So, the ratio is 6 : 9.
In the third ratio, the first term is 2. 
We can see that when we divide 14 (the first term of 14 : 21) by 7 
(HCF of 14 and 21) we get 2. 
If we divide 21 also by 7, we get 3. So, the ratio is 2 : 3.

decoction to milk is 15 : 35.

Example 8: For the mid-day meal in a school with 120 students, the cook 
usually makes 15 kg of rice. On a rainy day, only 80 students came to 
school. How many kilograms of rice should the cook make so that the 
food is not wasted?
The ratio of the number of students to the amount of rice needs to be 
proportional. 
So, 120 : 15 :: 80 : ?
What is the factor of change in the first term?
We can find that by dividing the terms 80
120 = 2

linked proportionally, out of which three are known and we must find 
the fourth, unknown, quantity. 
To solve such problems, we can model two proportional ratios using 
algebraic notation as —
a : b :: c : d. 
For these two ratios to be proportional, we know that term c should 
be a multiple of term a by a factor, say f, and term d should be a multiple 
of term b by the same factor f. So,
c = f a      ...(1)
d = f b      ...(2)
From (1) and (2), we can say that,
f =  c
a  and f = d
b .
Therefore, c
a = d
b.
Multiplying both sides by ab, we get, 
ab × c
a  = ab × d
b 
ab × c
a  = ab × d
b 
bc = ad or ad = bc
Thus, when a : b :: c : d, then ad = bc. This is known as cross multiplication 
of terms. 
Since ad = bc, we can show that
d = bc
a  .
Two ratios are proportional if their terms are equal when cross 
multiplied. The fourth unknown quantity can be found through such 
cross multiplication. 
	
In ancient India, Āryabhaṭa (199 CE) and others called such problems 
of proportionality Rule of Three problems. There were 3 numbers 
given — the pramāṇa (measure — ‘a’ in our case), the phala (fruit — ‘b’ 
in our case), and the ichchhā (requisition — ‘c’ in our case). To find the 
ichchhāphala (yield — ‘d’ in our case), Āryabhaṭa says,
“Multiply the phala by the ichchhā and divide the resulting product 
by the pramāṇa.”
In other words, Āryabhaṭa says,
“pramāṇa : phala :: ichchhā : ichchhāphala,” therefore,
pramāṇa × ichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā.
Proportional Reasoning-1
Thus,
ichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā
pramāṇa
.
Using the cross multiplication method proposed by Āryabhaṭa, ancient 
Indians solved complex problems that involved proportionality.
Example 9: A car travels 90 km in 150 minutes. If it continues at the 
same speed, what distance will it cover in 4 hours? 
If it continues at the same speed, the ratio of the time taken should be 
proportional to the ratio of the distance covered. 
150 : 90 :: 4 : ?
Is this the right way to formulate the question?
No, because 150 is in minutes, but 4 is in hours. The second ratio 
should use the same units for time as the first ratio. Since 4 hours is 240 
minutes, the right form is
150 : 90 :: 240 : ?
How can you find the distance covered in 240 minutes?
Discuss with your classmates and find the answer using different 
strategies.
We can model this proportion as
150 : 90 :: 240 : x.
By cross multiplication, we get
150 × x = 240 × 90

x = 240 × 90

Example 10: A small farmer in Himachal Pradesh sells each 200 g packet 
of tea for ₹200. A large estate in Meghalaya sells each 1 kg packet of 
tea for ₹800. Are the weight-to-price ratios in both places proportional? 
Which tea is more expensive?
Note to the Teacher: Instead of giving one ‘method’ to solve the problem of the 
distance, encourage students to reason out the answer through different strategies. 
They can use their understanding of equivalent fractions and equivalent ratios to 
find the answer.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
The ratio of weight to price of the Himachal tea is 200 : 200.
What is the weight to price ratio of the Meghalaya tea? Is it 1 : 800? 
This would not be appropriate, because we considered the weight in 
grams in the case of Himachal. So, the  weight to price ratio is 1000 : 800 
in Meghalaya after we convert the weight to grams.
To check if the ratios are proportional, we need to see if both ratios 
are the same in their simplest forms.
The Himachal tea ratio in its simplest form is 1 : 1.
The Meghalaya tea ratio in its simplest form is 5 : 4. 
So, the ratios are not proportional.
Which tea is more expensive? Why?
To answer the question as to which tea is more expensive, we should 
compare the price of tea for the same weight in both places. 
What is the price of 1 kg of tea from Meghalaya? It is ₹800.
In Himachal, if 200 g of tea costs rupees 200, what is the cost of 1 kg 
of tea? 
Let us say that  the price of 1 kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is 1
5 of 1 kg. 
So,	 	
	
	
	
  	
5 × x = 200.
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get
5 × x × 5 = 200 × 5
5 × x × 5 = 1000
x = 1000.
So, the cost of 1 kg of tea is ₹800 in Meghalaya and  ₹1,000 in Himachal 
Pradesh. 
Therefore, the tea from Himachal Pradesh is more expensive.

Note to the Teacher: Give a project to students. Start by dividing the class into 
groups. Each group should go to one shop and collect prices for different measures 
of the same product. For example, they should note down the prices of 500 g of

prices, and present them to the rest of the class. They should discuss if the prices are 
proportional or not, and why.
Proportional Reasoning-1
The ratio of the counters of your partner to yours is 5 : 7.
Now, if you want to share the counters between the two of you in the 
ratio of 3 : 1, how many counters would each of you get?   
Share the counters in different ways and see which combination is in 
the ratio 3 : 1.
One way to share the counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 is as follows —
1.	 Your partner takes 3 counters and you take 1 counter. There are now 
8 counters left.
2.	 Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. 
There are now 4 counters left.
3.	 Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. 
There are no more counters left.
So, your partner gets 9 counters in total and you get 3 counters. 
When we divide 12 counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 between two people, 
one gets 9 counters and the other gets 3 counters.
Now, if you want to share 42 counters between the two of you in the 
ratio of 4 : 3, how will you do it? 
Using the same procedure would take a long time! There is a simpler 
way to share the whole with parts in a specified ratio.
You need to divide 42 into groups such that your partner gets 4 groups 
and you get 3 groups. 
What is the size of each group?
If your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups, the total number 
of groups is 7. So, the size of each group is 42 ÷ 7 = 6.
Multiplying the number of groups by the size of each group, your 
partner gets 24 counters and you get 18 counters, when you share 42 
counters in the ratio of 4 : 3.

In general, when we want to divide a quantity, say x, in the ratio m: n, 
we do the following:
1.	 We need to split x into groups such that it can be divided into two 
parts where the first part has m groups and the second part has 
n groups.
2.	 But what is the size of each group? This can be found out by dividing 
x by the number of groups. The number of groups are m + n. So, the 
size of each group is 
x
m + n .
3.	 So, the first part has m × 
x
m + n objects and the second part has n × 
x
m + n
objects.
Thus, if we want to divide a quantity x in the ratio of m: n, then the 
parts will be m ×

m + n and n  ×

The ratio of their investment is 75000 : 25000.
Reducing this ratio to its simplest form, we get 3 : 1.
3 + 1 is 4 and dividing the profit of 4000 by 4, we get 1000.
So, Prashanti’s share is 3 × 1000 and Bhuvan’s share is 1 × 1000.
So, Prashanti would get ₹3,000 and Bhuvan would get ₹1,000 of the profit.
Example 12: A mixture of 40 kg contains sand and cement in the ratio

The ‛whole’ is 42
The ‛whole’ is 7 (= 4 + 3)
and 42 is 6 times 7
The ‛parts’ are 
6 times the ratio 4 : 3
Proportional Reasoning-1
Let us find the quantity of sand and cement in the original mixture.
The ratio is 3 : 1 and the total weight is 40 kg. 
So, the weight of sand is 
(3 + 1) × 40 = 30 kg.
The weight of cement is 
(3 + 1) × 40 = 10 kg.
The weight of sand is the same in the new mixture. It remains 30. But 
the new ratio of sand to cement is 5 : 2. So the question is,
5 : 2 :: 30 : ?
If the ratio is 5 : 2, then the second term is 2
5 times the first term. Since 
the new ratio is equivalent to 5 : 2, the second term in the new ratio 
should also be 2
5 times of 30.
 2
5 × 30 = 12.
The new mixture should have 12 kg of cement if the ratio of sand to 
cement is to be 5 : 2.
There is 10 kg of cement already. So, we need to add 2 kg of cement to 
the original mixture.

7.6 Unit Conversions
We have noticed earlier that solving problems with proportionality 
often requires us to convert units from one system to another. Here are 
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
a few important unit conversions for your reference.
Length
1 metre = 3.281 feet
Area
1 square metre = 10.764 square feet
1 acre = 43,560 square feet
1 hectare = 10,000 square metres
1 hectare = 2.471 acres
Volume
1 millilitre (mL) = 1 cubic centimetre (cc)
1 litre = 1,000 mL or 1,000 cc
Temperature
Temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius is a bit more 
complicated. 0
oC = 32 
oF, and 
Fahrenheit = 9
5 × Celsius + 32 
and
Celsius = 5
9 × (Fahrenheit–32)
For example, 25 
oC is 77 
oF.
