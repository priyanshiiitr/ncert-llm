2.1 Experiencing the Power Play ...
An Impossible Venture!
Take a sheet of paper, as large a sheet as you can find. Fold it once. Fold 
it again, and again. 
How many times can you fold it over and over?
Estu says “I heard that a sheet of paper can’t be folded more than 
7 times”.
Roxie replies “What if we use a thinner paper, like a newspaper or a 
tissue paper?”
Try it with different types of paper and see what happens.
Say you can fold a sheet of paper as many times as you wish. What would 
its thickness be after 30 folds? Make a guess.
Let us find out how thick a sheet of paper will be after 46 folds. Assume 
that the thickness of the sheet is 0.001 cm.
If you can fold a paper 
46 times, it will be so 
thick that it can reach 
the Moon!
What! That’s crazy! 
Just 46 times!? You 
must have ignored 
several zeros 
after 46.
Well, why 
don’t you find 
out yourselves.

The following table lists the thickness after each fold. Observe that the 
thickness doubles after each fold.

It might be hard to digest the fact that after just 46 folds, the thickness 
is more than 7,00,000 km. This is the power of multiplicative growth, 
also called exponential growth. Let us analyse the growth.
We have seen that the thickness doubles after every fold.
Notice the change in thickness after two 
folds. By how much does it increase?
After any 3 folds, the thickness increases 8 
times (= 2 × 2 × 2). Check if that is true. Similarly, 
from any point, the thickness after 10 folds increases by 1024 times 
(= 2 multiplied by itself 10 times), as shown in the table below.

2.2 Exponential Notation and Operations
The initial thickness of the paper was 0.001 cm. 
Upon folding once, its thickness became 0.001 cm × 2 = 0.002 cm.
Folding it twice, its thickness became —
0.001 cm × 2 × 2 = 0.004 cm, or 0.001 cm × 22 = 0.004 cm (in shorthand).
Upon folding it thrice, its thickness became —
0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 23 = 0.008 cm. 
When folded four times, its thickness became —
0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 24 = 0.016 cm.
Similarly, the expression for the thickness of the paper when folded 7 
times will be 0.001 cm × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, or 0.001 cm × 27 = 0.128 cm.
We have seen that square numbers can be expressed as n2 and cube 
numbers as n3.
n × n = n2 (read as ‘n squared’ or ‘n raised to the power 2’)

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
n × n × n = n3 (read as ‘n cubed’ or ‘n raised to the power 3’)
n × n × n × n = n4 (read as ‘n raised to the power 4’ or ‘the 4th power of n’)
n × n × n × n × n × n × n = n7 (read as ‘n raised to the power 7’ or ‘the 7th 
power of n’) and so on.
In general, we write na to denote n multiplied by itself a times.
	
	
      54 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 625.
54 is the exponential form of 625. Here, 4 is the 
exponent/power, and 5 is the base. Exponents of 
the form 5n are called powers of 5: 51, 52, 53, 54, etc. 
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 210 = 1024. 
Remember the 1024 from earlier? There, it meant 
that after every 10 folds, the thickness increased 
1024 times.
Which expression describes the thickness of a sheet of paper after 
it is folded 10 times? The initial thickness is represented by the 
letter-number v.
  (i)	10v	
(ii) 10 + v	
(iii) 2 × 10 × v
(iv)	210	
(v) 210v	
(vi) 102v
Some more examples of exponential notation:
4 × 4 × 4 = 43 = 64.
(– 4) × (– 4) × (– 4) = (– 4)3= – 64.
Similarly,
a × a × a × b × b can be expressed as a3b2 (read as a cubed b squared).
a × a × b × b × b × b can be expressed as a2b4 (read as a squared b raised 
to the power 4).
Remember that 4 + 4 + 4 = 3 × 4 = 12, whereas 4 × 4 × 4 = 43 = 64.
Express the number 32400 as a product of its prime factors 
and represent the prime factors in their exponential form.

The Stones that Shine ...
Three daughters with curious eyes,
Each got three baskets — a kingly prize.
Each basket had three silver keys,
Each opens three big rooms with ease.
Each room had tables — one, two, three,
With three bright necklaces on each, you see.
Each necklace had three diamonds so fine…
Can you count these stones that shine?
Hint: Find out the number of baskets and rooms. 
How many rooms were there altogether?
The information given can be visualised  as shown below.
From the diagram, the number of rooms is 34. This can be computed 
by repeatedly multiplying 3 by itself,
3 × 3 = 9.
9 × 3 = 27.
27 × 3 = 81.
81 × 3 = 243.
How many diamonds were there in total? Can we find out by just one 
multiplication using the products above?
The number of diamonds is 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 37.

We can write
37 = (3 × 3 × 3 × 3) × (3 × 3 × 3)
We had computed till 34. To find 37, we can just multiply 34 (= 81) with 
33 (= 27).
	
= 34 × 33
	
= 81 × 27 = 2187
37 can also be written as 32 × 35. Can you reason out why?
This can be easily extended to products where exponents are the 
same letter-numbers.
Write the product p4 × p6 in exponential form.
p4 × p6 = (p × p × p × p) × (p × p × p × p × p × p) = p10.
We can generalise this to —
na × nb = na+b, where a and b are counting numbers.
Use this observation to compute the following.

46 can be evaluated in these two ways,
(4 × 4 × 4) × (4 × 4 × 4) = 43 × 43
                                         = 64 × 64 
                                         = 4096.
43 × 43 is the square of 43, i.e.,
43 × 43 can also be written as 
(43)

(4 × 4) × (4 × 4) × (4 × 4) = 42 × 42 × 42
                                            = 16 × 16 × 16 
                                            = 4096.
42 × 42 × 42 is the cube of 42, i.e., 
42 × 42 × 42 can also be written as (42)

Similarly, 74 = (7 × 7) × (7 × 7) = 72 × 72 = (72)

210 = (2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × (2 × 2)

Magical Pond
In the middle of a beautiful, magical pond 
lies a bright pink lotus. The number of 
lotuses doubles every day in this pond. 
After 30 days, the pond is completely 
covered with lotuses. On which day was 
the pond half full?
If the pond is completely covered by 
lotuses on the 30th day, how much of it is 
covered by lotuses on the 29th day?
Since the number of lotuses doubles every day, the pond should be 
half covered on the 29th day.
Write the number of lotuses (in exponential form) when the pond was —
(i)	 fully covered	
(ii)	 half covered
There is another pond in which the number of lotuses triples every day. 
When both the ponds had no flowers, Damayanti placed a lotus in the 
doubling pond. After 4 days, she took all the lotuses from there and put 
them in the tripling pond. How many lotuses will be in the tripling pond 
after 4 more days?
After the first 4 days, the number of lotuses is 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 24.
After the next 4 days, the number of lotuses is 24 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 24 × 34.
What if Damayanti had changed the order in which she placed the 
flowers in the lakes? How many lotuses would be there?
1 × 34 × 24 = (3 × 3 × 3 × 3) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 2).
Can this product be expressed as an exponent mn, where m and n are 
some counting numbers?
By regrouping the numbers,
	
= (3 × 2) × (3 × 2) × (3 × 2) × (3 × 2)
	
= (3 × 2)4 = 64.
In general form,

How Many Combinations
Estu has 4 dresses and 3 caps. How many different ways can Estu combine 
the dresses and caps?
For each cap, he can choose any of the 4 dresses, so for 3 caps, 4 + 4 + 
4 = 4 × 3 = 12 combinations are possible. We can also look at it as — for 
each dress, Estu can choose any of the 3 caps, so for 4 outfits, 3 + 3 + 3 + 
3 = 3 × 4 = 12 combinations are possible.
Roxie has 7 dresses, 2 hats, and 3 pairs of shoes. How many different 
ways can Roxie dress up?
Hint: Try drawing a diagram like the one above.
Estu and Roxie came across a safe containing old stamps and coins 
that their great-grandfather had collected. It was secured with a 
5-digit password. Since nobody knew the password, they had no 
option except to try every password until it opened. They were 
unlucky and the lock only opened with the last password, after 
they had tried all possible combinations. How many passwords 
did they end up checking?
Instead of a 5-digit lock, let us assume we have a 2-digit lock and try 
to find out how many passwords are possible.
There are 10 options for the first digit (0 to 9). For each of these, there 
are 10 options for the second digit (If 0 is the first digit then 00, 01, 02, 
03, …, 09 are possible). Therefore the total number of combinations for 
a 2-digit lock is 10 × 10 = 100.
Now, suppose we have a 3-digit lock. For each of the earlier 100 
(2-digit) passwords there are 10 choices for the third digit. So, there are 
100 × 10 = 1000 combinations for a 3-digit lock. You can list them all: 000, 
001, 002, ….., 997, 997, 999.
If you can’t solve a problem, try to find a simpler version of the 
problem that you can solve. This technique can come in handy 
many times.
Power Play
How many 5-digit passwords are possible?
Each digit has 10 choices, so a 
5-digit lock will have:
10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 105 
= 1,00,000 passwords. This is 
the same as writing numbers 
till 99,999 with all 5 digits, i.e., 
00000, 00001, 00002, …00010, 
00011, …, 00100, 00101, …, 00999, 
…, 30456, …, 99998, 99999.
Estu says, “Next time, I will 
buy a lock that has 6 slots with 
the letters A to Z. I feel it is safer.”
How many passwords are possible with such a lock?
Think about how many combinations are possible in different 
contexts. Some examples are —
(i)	 Pincodes of places in India — The Pincode of Vidisha in 
Madhya Pradesh is 464001. The Pincode of Zemabawk in 
Mizoram is 796017.
(ii)	 Mobile numbers.
(iii)	 Vehicle registration numbers.
Try to find out how these numbers or codes are allotted/generated.
2.3 The Other Side of Powers
Imagine a line of length 16 units. Erasing half of it would result in
24 ÷ 2 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 23 = 8 units.
Erasing half one more time would result in, 
(24 ÷ 2) ÷ 2 = 24  ÷ 22 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
2 × 2
 = 2 × 2 = 22 = 4 units.
Halving 16 cm three times may be written as,
24  ÷ 23 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
2 × 2 × 2  = 2 = 21 = 2 units.
From this we can see that
24 ÷ 23 = 24 – 3 = 21.

Why can’t n be 0?
We have not covered the case when the exponent is 0; for example, 
what is 20?
Let us define 20 in a way that the generalised form above holds true.
20 = 24 – 4 = 24 ÷ 24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1.
In fact for any letter number a
20 = 2a – a = 2a ÷ 2a = 1.
In general, 
xa ÷ xa = xa – a = x0, and so
1 = x0 , 
where x ≠ 0 and a is a counting number.
When Zero is in Power!
When a line of length 24 units is halved 5 times,
24  ÷ 25 = 
2 × 2 × 2 × 2
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1
2  units.
Using the generalised form, we get 24 ÷ 25= 2(4 – 5) = 2– 1.
So, 2– 1 = 1
2  .
When a line of length 24 units is halved 10 times,
we get 24 ÷ 210= 2(4 – 10) = 2– 6 units.
When expanded, 24 ÷ 210 = 
2 × 2 × 2 × 2
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1
26  = 1

which is also written as 2– 6.

2.4 Powers of 10
We have used numbers like 10, 100, 1000, and so on when writing Indian 
numerals in an expanded form. For example,
47561 = (4 × 10000) + (7 × 1000) + (5 × 100) + (6 × 10) + 1.
This can be written using powers of 10 as
(4 × 104) + (7 × 103) + (5 × 102) + (6 × 101) + (1 × 100).
Write these numbers in the same way: (i) 172, (ii) 5642, (iii) 6374.
How can we write 561.903?
561.903 = (5 × 100) + (6 × 10) + 1 + (9 × 1
10) + (0 × 1
100) + (3 × 
1000).
Writing it using powers of 10, we have
561.903 = (5 × 102) + (6 × 101) + (1 × 100) + (9 × 10–1) + (0 × 10–2) + (3 × 10–3).

Scientific Notation
Let’s look at some facts involving large numbers —
(i)	 The Sun is located 30,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 m from the 
centre of our Milky Way galaxy.
(ii)	 The number of stars in our galaxy is 1,00,00,00,00,000.
(iii)	 The mass of the Earth is 59,76,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 kg.
As the number of digits increases, it becomes difficult to read the 
numbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place 
commas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting 
₹5,000 when you were supposed to get ₹50,000. The number of zeroes is 
more important than the initial digits in several cases.
Can we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very 
large numbers correctly?
For example, the number 5900 can be expressed as —
5900 = 590 × 10 = 590 × 101 
     = 59 × 100 = 59 × 102
       = 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103
              = 0.59 × 10000 = 0.59 × 104.
Any number can be written as the product of a number between 
1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example,
	
5900 = 5.9 × 103 	
	
20800 = 2.08 × 104	
80,00,000 = 8 × 106
Write the large-number facts we read just before in this form.
In scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form), 
we write numbers as x × 10 y, where x ≥ 1 and x < 10 is the coefficient and 
y, the exponent, is any integer. Often, the exponent y is more important 
than the coefficient x. When we write the 2 crore population of Mumbai 
as 2 × 107, the 7 is more important than the 2. Indeed, if the 2 is changed 
to 3, the population increases by one-half, i.e., 2 crore to 3 crore, whereas 
if the 7 is changed to 8, the change in population is 10 times, i.e., 2 crores 
to 20 crores. Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the 
exponent, which indicates the number of digits.
If we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the 
impression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units 
place. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned 
about how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value. If 
we are only sure that the population is around 1 lakh 42 thousand, we 
can write it as 1.42 × 105. If we can only be certain that it is around 1 lakh 
40 thousand, we write it as 1.4 × 105. The number of digits in the coefficient 
reflects how well we know the number. The most important part of any 
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
number written in scientific form is the exponent, and then the first 
digit of the coefficient. The digits following the coefficient are small 
corrections to the first digit.
These values are rounded-off estimates, averages, or approximations; 
most of the time, they serve the purpose at hand.

2.5 Did You Ever Wonder?
Last year, we looked at interesting thought experiments in the chapter 
on Large Numbers. Let us continue this journey.
Nanjundappa wants to donate jaggery equal to Roxie’s weight and 
wheat equal to Estu’s weight. He is wondering how much it would cost.
What would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated jaggery? What 
would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated wheat?
In order to find out, let us first describe the relationships among the 
quantities present.
Worth of jaggery (in rupees) = Roxie’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg jaggery. 
Worth of wheat (in rupees) = Estu’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg wheat.
Make necessary and reasonable assumptions for the unknowns and find 
the answers. Remember, Roxie is 13 years old and Estu is 11 years old.
Assuming Roxie’s weight to be 45 kg and the cost of 1 kg of jaggery to be 
₹70, the worth of donated jaggery is 45 × 70 = ₹3150. Assuming Estu’s 
weight to be 50 kg and the cost of 1 kg of wheat to be ₹50, the worth of 
donated wheat is 50 × 50 = ₹2500.
Roxie wonders, “Instead of jaggery if we use 1-rupee coins, how many 
coins are needed to equal my weight?”. How can we find out?
For questions like these, you can consider following the steps suggested 
below.
1.	 Guessing: Make an instinctive (quick) guess of what the answer could 
be, without any calculations.
The practice of offering goods equal to the weight of a person, called 
Tulābhāra or Tulābhāram, is quite old and is still followed in many 
places in Southern India. It is a symbol of bhakti (surrendering oneself), 
a token of gratitude; it also supports the community.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
2.	 Calculating using estimation and approximation —
(i)	 Describe the relationships among the quantities that are needed 
to find the answer.
(ii)	 Make reasonable assumptions and approximations if the required 
information is not available.
(iii)	 Compute and find the answer (and check how close your guess 
was).
Would the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or 
even more? Make an instinctive guess.
Find the answer by making necessary and 
reasonable assumptions and approximations for 
the unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for 
an exact answer but a reasonably close estimate.
Estu asks, “What if we use 5-rupee coins or 10-rupee notes instead? 
How much money could it be?”
Make an instinctive guess first. Then find out (make necessary and 
reasonable assumptions about the unknown details and find the 
answers).
Estu says, “When I become an adult, I would like to donate notebooks 
worth my weight every year”. Roxie says, “When I grow up, I would like 
to do annadāna (offering grains or meals) worth my weight every year”. 
How many people might benefit from each of these offerings in a 
year? Again, guess first before finding out.
Roxie and Estu overheard someone saying — “We did pādayātra for 
about 400 km to reach this place! We arrived early this morning.”
How long ago would they have started their journey?
Find answers by making necessary assumptions and approximations. 
Do guess first before calculating to check how close your guess was!
How about measuring 
to find out the weight 
of a 1-rupee coin?
Initially, your guesses may be very far off from the answer and 
it is perfectly fine! You will get better at it like as you do it often 
and in different situations. Guessing and estimating can build 
intuition about numbers and various quantities.
Math 
Talk
Note to the Teacher: Assumptions can vary greatly at times, and as a result the 
answers computed using these you can also vary. This is perfectly alright. Modelling 
the situation properly is crucial, which can also be done in different ways sometimes. 
The accuracy of the assumed numbers or quantities can get better with exposure 
and practice.

Before the rise of modern transport, people moved from one place to 
another by walking — sometimes merchants, sages, and scholars walked 
thousands of kilometres to different parts of the world across deserts, 
mountains, and rivers.
How many times can a person circumnavigate (go around the world) the 
Earth in their lifetime if they walk non-stop? Consider the distance around 
the Earth as 40,000 km.
Linear Growth vs. Exponential Growth
Roxie tells Estu about a science-fiction novel she is reading where they 
build a ladder to reach 
the moon, “... I wonder if 
we actually had a ladder 
like that, how many steps 
would it have?”.
What do you think? Make 
an instinctive guess first.
Would the number of steps 
be in thousands, lakhs, 
crores, or even more? 
To find out, we would 
need to know the gap between consecutive steps of the ladder. Let’s 
assume a reasonable distance of 20 cm. Visualising the problem as shown,
Pādayātra, is the traditional practice of walking long distances as part 
of a religious or spiritual pursuit. People across religions in our country 
observe similar forms of pilgrimage or spiritual walking, although they 
may have different names or purposes.
Some of the pilgrimages are Ajmer Sharif Dargah Ziyarat, 
Pandharpur Wari, Kānwar Yatra, Sabarimala Yatra, Sammed 
Shikharji Yatra, Lumbini to Sarnath Yatra.
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
We have to find out how many 20 cm make 3,84,400 km.
If we calculate the value, we get the result as 1,92,20,00,000 steps, which 
is 192 crore and 20 lakh steps or 1 billion 922 million steps. The fixed 
increase in the distance from the earth with each step (a 20 cm gain after 
each step) is called linear growth. 
To cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon, it takes 
1,92,20,00,000 steps with linear growth whereas it takes just 46 folds of 
a piece of paper with exponential growth! Linear growth is additive, 
whereas exponential growth is multiplicative.
20 + 20 + 20 + …………
1,92,20,00,000
times   
0.001 × 2 × 2 × 2 ………. 
46 times
Some examples of exponential growth we have seen earlier in 
this chapter are ‘The Stones that Shine’, ‘Magical Pond’, ‘How Many 
Combinations’. We shall explore more such interesting examples in a 
later chapter and also in the next grade.
Can you come up with some examples of linear growth and of 
exponential growth?
Getting a Sense for Large Numbers
Last year, we learnt about lakhs and crores, as well as millions and 
billions. A lakh is 105 (1,00,000), a crore is 107 (1,00,00,000), and an arab 
is 109 (1,00,00,00,000), whereas a million is 106 (1,000,000) and a billion 
is 109 (1,000,000,000). 
You might know the size of the world’s human population. Have you 
ever wondered how many ants there might be in the world or how long ago 
humans emerged? In this section, we shall explore numbers significantly 
larger than arabs and billions. We shall use powers of 10 to represent and 
compare these numbers in each case.

2.5 A Pinch of History
In the Lalitavistara, a Buddhist treatise from the first century BCE, we see 
number - names for odd powers of ten up to 1053. The following occurs 
as part of the dialogue between the mathematician Arjuna and Prince 
Gautama, the Bodhisattva.
“Hundred kotis are called an ayuta (109), hundred ayutas a niyuta (1011), 
hundred niyutas a kankara (1013), …, hundred sarva-balas a visamjna-
gati (1047), hundred visamjna-gatis a sarvajna (1049),  hundred sarvajnas 
a vibhutangama (1051), a hundred vibhutangamas is a tallakshana (1053).”
Mahaviracharya gives a list of 24 terms (i.e., up to 1023) in his treatise 
Ganita-sara-sangraha. An anonymous Jaina treatise Amalasiddhi gives a 
list with a name for each power of ten up to 1096 (dasha-ananta). A Pali 
grammar treatise of Kāccāyana lists number-names up to 10140, named 
asaṅkhyeya.

Very large quantities are often beyond our experience and 
comprehension. To put them into perspective, we can relate and 
compare them with quantities we are familiar with. This can 
give an essence of how large a number or a measure is!

For expressing high powers of ten, Jaina and Buddhist texts use bases 
like sahassa (thousand) and koṭi (ten million); for instance, prayuta (106) 
would be dasa sata sahassa (ten hundred thousand).
The modern naming is similar to this, where we say,
Continuing this, a hundred kharab is a neel (1013), a hundred neel is a 
padma (1015), a hundred padma is a shankh (1017) and a hundred shankh 
is a maha shankh (1019).
In the American/International system, we say 
A thousand thousand 
is a million
1000 × 1000 = 1,000,000
103 × 103 = 106
A thousand million is 
a billion
1000 × 1,000,000 = 1,000,000,000
103 × 106 = 109
A thousand billion is 
an trillion
1000 × 1,000,000,000 
= 1,00,000,000,000
103 × 109 = 1012
Continuing this, a thousand trillion is a quadrillion (1015). This pattern 
continues. Observe the names million (106), billion (109), trillion (1012), 
quadrillion (1015), quintillion (1018), sextillion (1021), septillion (1024), 
octillion (1027), nonillion (1030), decillion (1033).
What does the first part of each name denote?
The number 10100 is also called a googol. The estimated number 
of atoms in the universe is 1078 to 1082. The number 10googol is called a 
googolplex. It is hard to imagine how large this number is!
The currency note with the highest denomination in India currently 
is 2000 rupees. Guess what is the highest denomination of a currency 
note ever, across the world. The highest numerical value banknote ever 
printed was a special note valued 1 sextillion pengő (1021 or 1 milliard 
bilpengő) printed in Hungary in 1946, but it was never issued. In 2009, 
Zimbabwe printed a 100 trillion (1014) Zimbabwean dollar note, which at 
the time of printing was worth about $30.
A hundred 
thousand is a lakh
100 × 1000 = 1,00,000
102 × 103 = 105
A hundred lakhs 
is a crore
100 × 1,00,000 = 1,00,00,000
102 × 105 = 107
A hundred crores 
is an arab
100 × 1,00,00,000 = 1,00,00,00,000
102 × 107 = 109
A hundred arab is 
a kharab

We analysed some situations, asked questions, and found 
answers by first guessing, then modelling the problem 
statement, 
followed 
by 
making 
assumptions 
and 
approximations to carry out  the calculations.

We experienced how rapid exponential growth, also called 
multiplicative growth, can be compared to additive growth.

na is n × n × n × n ×…× n (n multiplied by itself a times) and n–a= 1
na.
	

Operations with exponents satisfy
	y na × nb = na+b	
	y (na)b = (nb)a = na × b
	y na ÷ nb = na – b (n ǂ 0)
	y na × ma = (n × m)a
	y na ÷ ma = (n ÷ m)a (m ǂ 0)
	y n0 = 1 (n ǂ 0)

SUMMARY
Tremendous in Ten!
Find a partner to play this game with. In 10 seconds, the person who 
writes a number or an expression, using only the digits 0 - 9 and 
arithmetic operations, that gives a number that is the larger between 
the two wins the round.
In Round 1, Roxie wrote 10000000000000 and Estu wrote 999999 × 999999. 
Between these two, Roxie’s number is greater. Can you see why? Roxie’s 
number is 1013, whereas Estu’s number is less than (106)
2.
In Round 2, Roxie wrote 101000 + 101000 + 101000 + 101000 and Estu wrote 
(101000000) × 9000. Can you say which is greater?
