Queen Ratnamanjuri had a will written that described her fortune of 
ratnas (precious stones) and also included a puzzle. Her son Khoisnam 
and their 99 relatives were invited to the reading of her will. She wanted 
to leave all of her ratnas to her son, but she knew that if she did so, all 
their relatives would pester Khoisnam forever. She hoped that she had 
taught him everything he needed to know about solving puzzles. She left 
the following note in her will—
“I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it at the same time, you 
will share the ratnas equally. However, if you are the first one to solve the 
problem, you will get to keep the entire inheritance to yourself. Good luck.”
The minister took Khoisnam and his 99 relatives to a secret room in 
the mansion containing 100 lockers.
The minister explained— “Each person is assigned a number from 1 to 
100. 
•	 Person 1 opens every locker.
•	 Person 2 toggles every 2nd locker (i.e., closes it if it is open, opens 
it if it is closed).
•	 Person 3 toggles every 3rd locker (3rd, 6th, 9th, … and so on).
•	 Person 4 toggles every 4th locker (4th, 8th, 12th, … and so on).
This continues until all 100 get their turn.
In the end, only some lockers remain open. The open lockers reveal 
the code to the fortune in the safe.”
Before the process begins, Khoisnam realises that he 
already knows which lockers will be open at the end. 
How did he figure out the answer?
Hint: Find out how many times each locker is toggled. 
A SQUARE AND A CUBE
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
If a locker is toggled an odd number of times, it will be open. Otherwise, 
it will be closed. The number of times a locker is toggled is the same as 
the number of factors of the locker number. For example, for locker #6, 
Person 1 opens it, Person 2 closes it, Person 3 opens it and Person 6 closes 
it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are factors of 6. If 
the number of factors is even, the locker will be 
toggled by an even number of people and it will 
eventually be closed.
Note that each factor of a number has a 
‛partner factor’ so that the product of the pair 
of factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and 
6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3 
form another pair.
Does every number have an even number of factors?
We see in some cases, like 2 × 2, that the numbers in the pair are the 
same.
Can you use this insight to find more numbers with an odd number of 
factors?
For instance, 36 has a factor pair 6 × 6 where both numbers are 6. 
Does this number have an odd number of factors? If every factor of 36 
other than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure 
that 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true.
Hence all the following numbers have an odd number of factors —
1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, ... 
A number that can be expressed as the product of a number with 
itself is called a square number, or simply a square. The only numbers 
that have an odd number of factors are the squares, because they each 
have one factor which, when multiplied by itself, equals the number. 
Therefore, every locker whose number is a square will remain open.

Write the locker numbers that remain open.
1.1 Square Numbers
Why are the numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, …, called squares? We know that the 
number of unit squares in a square (the area of a square) is the product 
of its sides. The table below gives the areas of squares with different 
sides.
We use the following notation for squares.
1 × 1 = 12 = 1 
2 × 2 = 22 = 4 
3 × 3 = 32 = 9, 
4 × 4 = 42 = 16 
5 × 5 = 52 = 25.
...
In general, for any number n, we write n × n = n2, which is read as ‛n squared’.
Can we have a square of sidelength 3
5 or 2.5 units? 
Yes, there area in square units are ( 3
5)
2 = ( 3
5) × ( 3
5) = ( 9
25), 
and (2.5)
2 = (2.5) × (2.5) = 6.25.
Khoisnam immediately collects word clues from these 10 lockers and 
reads, “The passcode consists of the first five locker numbers that 
were touched exactly twice.”
Which are these five lockers?
The lockers that are toggled twice are the prime numbers, since each 
prime number has 1 and the number itself as factors. So, the code is 
2-3-5-7-11.
Sidelength 
(in units)
Area 
(in sq units)
1 × 1 = 1 sq. unit
2 × 2 = 4 sq. units
3 × 3 = 9 sq. units
4 × 4 = 16 sq. units
5 × 5 = 25 sq. units
10 × 10 = 100 sq. units

The squares of natural numbers are called perfect squares. For

What patterns do you notice? Share your observations and make 
conjectures.
Study the squares in the table above. What are the digits in the 
units places of these numbers? All these numbers end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 
9. None of them end with 2, 3, 7 or 8.
If a number ends in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9, is it always a square?
The numbers 16 and 36 are both squares with 6 in the units place. 
However, 26, whose units digit is also 6, is not a square. Therefore, we 
cannot determine if a number is a square just by looking at the digit in 
the units place. But, the units digit can tell us when a number is not a 
square. If a number ends with 2, 3, 7, or 8, then we can definitely say that 
it is not a square.
Write 5 numbers such that you can determine by looking at their units 
digit that they are not squares.
The squares, 12, 92, 112, 192, 212, and 292, all have 1 in their units place. 
Write the next two squares. Notice that if a number has 1 or 9 in the 
units place, then its square ends in 1.
Let us consider square numbers ending in 6: 16 = 42, 36 = 62, 196 = 142, 
256 = 162, 576 = 242, and 676 = 262.

Find more such patterns by observing the numbers and their squares 
from the table you filled earlier.
Consider the following numbers and their squares.
If a number contains 3 zeros at the end, how many zeros will its square 
have at the end?
What do you notice about the number of zeros at the end of a number 
and the number of zeros at the end of its square? Will this always 
happen? Can we say that squares can only have an even number of 
zeros at the end? 
What can you say about the parity of a number and its square?
Perfect Squares and Odd Numbers
Let us explore the differences between consecutive squares. What do 
you notice?
4 – 1 = 3    9 – 4 = 5    16 – 9 = 7    25 – 16 = 9
See if this pattern continues for the next few square numbers.
From this we observe that adding  consecutive odd numbers starting 
from 1 gives consecutive square numbers, as shown below.
102 = 100
202 = 400
402 = 800
1002 = 10000

Do you remember this pattern from Grade 6?
The picture below explains why each subsequent inverted L gives the 
next odd number:
We see that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2. Alternatively, 
every square is a sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1.
Also, we can find out whether a number is a perfect square by 
successively subtracting odd numbers. Consider the number 25, 
successively subtract 1, 3, 5, ... until you get or cross over 0, 
This means 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 and is thus a perfect square. Since we 
subtracted the first five odd numbers, 25 = 52.
Using the pattern above, find 362, given that 352 = 1225. 
From the question we know that 1225 is the sum of the first 35 odd 
numbers. To find 362, we need to add the 36th odd number to 1225. 
How do we find the 36th odd number?
The 1st odd number is 1, 2nd odd number is 3, 3rd number is 5, …, 6th 
odd number is 11 and so on. 
What is the nth odd number?
The nth odd number is 2n–1.
Therefore, the 36th odd number is 71. 
By adding 71 to 1225, we get 1296, which is 362.
Consider a number such as 38 that is not a square and subtract 
consecutive odd numbers starting from 1.
This shows that 38 cannot be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd 
numbers starting with 1.

1 + 3 + (3 + 2)

In mathematics, sometimes arguments and reasoning can be 
presented without any words. Visual proofs can be complete by 
themselves.
25 – 1 = 24    24 – 3 = 21    21 – 5 = 16    16 – 7 = 9    9 – 9 = 0
	
38 – 1 = 37	
37 – 3 = 34	
34 – 5 = 29	
29 – 7 = 22	
22 – 9 = 13
	
13 – 11 = 2

Thus, we can say that a natural number is not a perfect square if it 
cannot be expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers starting 
from 1. We can use this result to find out whether a natural number is a 
perfect square.
Find how many numbers lie between two consecutive perfect squares.

1 + 3 = 4 = 22

6 + 10 = 16 = 42
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
So, the length of the side of a square with an area of 49 sq. cm is 7 cm.
We call 7 the square root of 49.
In general, if y= x2 then x is the square root of y.
What is the square root of 64?
We know that 8 × 8 is 64. So, 8 is the square root of 64. What about 
– 8 × – 8 ? That is 64 too!
82 = 64, and (– 8)2 = 64.
So, the square roots of 64 are + 8 and – 8.
Every perfect square has two integer square roots. One is positive and 
the other is negative. The square root of a number is denoted by

In this chapter, we shall only consider the positive square root.
Given a number, such as 576 or 327, how do we find out if it is a 
perfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square 
root?
We know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even 
number of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this 
condition is a square.
We can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we 
cannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square.
1.	 We can list all the square numbers in sequence and find out 
whether 576 occurs among them. We know that 202 = 400, we can 
find squares of 21, 22, 23, … and so on until we get 576 or a number 
greater than 576.
202 = 400    212 = 441    222 = 484    232 = 529    242 = 576
	
However, this process becomes inefficient for larger numbers.
2.	 Recall that every square can be expressed as a sum of consecutive 
odd numbers starting from 1.
  Consider 81.
  	
From 81, we successively subtracted consecutive odd numbers 
starting from 1 until we obtained 0 at the 9th step. Therefore 81 = 9.
  	
Can we find the square root of 729 using this method? Yes, but it 
will be time-consuming.

3.	 We know that a perfect square is obtained by multiplying an integer 
by itself. Will looking at a number’s prime factorisation help in 
determining whether it is a perfect square?
	
Yes, if we can divide the prime factors of a number into two 
equal groups, then the product of the prime factors in either group 
combine to form the square root. 
Is 324 a perfect square?
	
	
	
	
324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.
These can be grouped as 
	
	
	
	
324 = (2 × 3 × 3) × (2 × 3 × 3).
	
	
	
	
	
= (2 × 3 × 3)2 = 182.
We can also write the prime factors in pairs. That is,
	
	
	
	
324 = (2 × 2) × (3 × 3) × (3 × 3), 
which shows that 324 is a perfect square. Thus,
	
	
	
	
324 = (2×3×3)2 = 182.
	
 Therefore, 324  =18. 
Is 156 a perfect square? 
The prime factorisation of 156 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 13.
We cannot pair up these factors. 
Therefore, 156 is not a perfect square.
Find whether 1156 and 2800 are perfect squares using prime factorisation.
We can estimate the square root of larger perfect squares by looking 
at the closest perfect squares we are familiar with and then narrowing 
down the interval to search.
For example, to find 1936 , we can reason as follows:
	 (i)	
1936 is between 1600 (402) and 2500 (502), so 40 < 1936  < 50.
	(ii)	
The last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root 
must either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46. 
(iii)	 If we calculate 452, we can compare it with 1936 to halve 
the interval to search from 40–50 to either 40–45 or 45–50. 
We can write 452 as (40 + 5) (40 + 5) = 402 + 2 × 40 × 5 + 52
= 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025.
	(iv)	 2025 > 1936. So, 40 < 1936  < 45
	(v)	
From the observation in point b we can guess and then verify 
that 1936  is 44.
Consider the following situations —
Aribam and Bijou play a game. One says a number and the other 
replies with its square root. Aribam starts. He says 25, and Bijou quickly 
Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 
responds with 5. Then Bijou says 81, and Aribam answers 9. The game 
goes on till Aribam says 250. Bijou is not able to answer because 250 
is not a perfect square. Aribam asks Bijou if he can at least provide a 
number that is close to the square root of 250.
For this, Bijou needs to estimate the square root of 250.
We know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100  = 10 and 
400  = 20.
So, 10 < 
250  < 20.
But, we are still not very close to the number whose square is 250.
We know that 152 = 225 and 162 = 256.
Therefore, 15 < 
250  < 16. Since 256 is much closer to 250 than 225,
250  is approximately 16. We also know it is less than 16.
Here is another problem that requires estimating square roots.
Akhil has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm2. He wants to know 
if he can cut out a square handkerchief of side 15 cm. If not, he wants 
to know the maximum size handkerchief that can be cut out from this 
piece of cloth with an integer side length. 
125 is not a perfect square. The nearest perfect squares are 112 = 121 
and 122 = 144. So the largest square handkerchief with integer side length 
that can be cut out from this piece of cloth has side length 11 cm.

Consider the numbers 1, 8, 27, ...
These numbers are called perfect cubes. Can you see why they are

Each of them is obtained by multiplying a number by itself three

8 = 2 × 2 × 2 
27 = 3 × 3 × 3 
Is 9 a cube? 
We see that 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 and 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. This shows that 
9 is not a perfect cube. Nor is any number from 10 to 26.
Can you estimate the number of unit cubes in a cube with an 
edge length of 4 units?
It has 64 unit cubes! If you notice carefully, each layer 
of this cube has 4 × 4 unit cubes. Each square layer has 
16 unit cubes (4 × 4), and there are 4 such layers, so the 
total number of unit cubes is 4 × 4 × 4 = 64.
Since 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125, 125 is a cube.

n × n × n as n3.

squares. What are the possible last digits of cubes?
Similar to squares, can you find the number of cubes with 1 digit, 2 digits, 
and 3 digits? What do you observe?
Can a cube end with exactly two zeroes (00)? Explain.
Just as we can take squares of fractions/decimals — ( 4
6 )2, (13.08)2, and 
(– 6)2 — we also can compute cubes of such numbers — (4
6)3, (13.08)3, and 
(– 6)3.

Taxicab Numbers 
Once when Srinivasa Ramanujan was working with 
G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, Hardy had 
come to visit Ramanujan at a hospital when he was 
ill. Hardy had ridden in a taxicab numbered 1729 and 
he remarked that 1729 was ‘rather a dull number,’ 
adding that he hoped that this was not a bad sign. 
Ramanujan immediately replied, “No, Hardy, it is a 
very interesting number. It is the smallest number 
that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two 
different ways”. 
1729 = 13 + 123 
           = 93 + 103.
Because of this story, 1729 has since been known as the Hardy–
Ramanujan Number. And numbers that can be expressed as the sum of 
two cubes in two different ways are called taxicab numbers.
The next two taxicab numbers after 1729 are 4104 and 13832. Find 
the two ways in which each of these can be expressed as the sum of 
two positive cubes.
How did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All through his 
life, he tinkered with numbers. During Ramanujan’s time in Cambridge, 
his colleagues often marveled at his ability to see deep patterns in numbers 
that seemed arbitrary to others. His colleague, John Littlewood, once said, 
“Every positive integer was one of his [Ramanujan's] personal friends”.

7 + 9 + 11 = 27 = 33
13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 64 = 43
21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 = 125 = 53
31 + 33 + 35 + 37 + 39 + 41 = 216 = 63.
Later in this series, we get the following set of consecutive numbers:
91 + 93 + 95 + 97 + 99 + 101 + 103 + 105 + 107 + 109.
Can you tell what this sum is without doing the calculation?
Cube Roots
We know that 8 = 23.
We call 2 the cube root of 8 and denote this by 2 = 8
.
More generally, if y = x3, then x is the cube root of y. This is denoted by 
x = 
y
. So,  8

 = 2.

How do we find out if a number is a cube? Taking inspiration from the 
case of squares, let us see if we can use prime factorisations.
Let us check if 3375 is a perfect cube.
3375 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5.
Can the factors be split into three identical groups? For 3375, we can 
form three groups of (3 × 5). So,
3375 = (3 × 5) × (3 × 5) × (3 × 5)
	
	
	
	
	
  = (3 × 5)3 = 153.
Another way is to check if the factors can be grouped into triplet(s): 
3375 = (3 × 3 × 3) × (5 × 5 × 5) = 33 × 53.
This means 3375

. 
Is 500 a perfect cube?
500 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5. We see that the factors cannot be split into three 
identical groups. Therefore, 500 is not a perfect cube.

4 = 2 × 2 
43 = 64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 23 × 23
6 = 2 × 3
63 = 216 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 33
15 = 3 × 5
153 = 3375 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 33 × 53
12 = 2 × 2 × 3
123 = 1728 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 
= 23 × 23 × 33
Observe that each prime factor of a number appears three times in 
the prime factorisation of its cube.

Successive Differences
We know that the differences between consecutive perfect squares gives 
the sequence of odd numbers. Observe the figure below where the 
differences are computed successively for perfect squares. After two 
levels, all the differences are the same.
Compute successive differences over levels for perfect cubes until all the 
differences at a level are the same. What do you notice?
1.3 A Pinch of History
The first known list of perfect squares and perfect 
cubes was compiled by the Babylonians as far 
back as 1700 BCE. These lists, found on clay tablets, 
were used to quickly find square roots and cube

roots in problems involving land measurement, architectural design, 
and other areas where geometric calculations were necessary. 
In ancient Sanskrit works the term varga was used both for the square 
figure or its area, as well as the square power, and the term ghana was 
used both for the solid cube as well as the product of a number with 
itself three times. The fourth power was called varga-varga . These terms 
were used in India at least from the third century BCE.
Aryabhata (499 CE) states
“A square figure of four equal sides and the number representing its area 
are called varga. The product of two equal quantities is also called varga.”
Thus, the term varga for square power has its origin in the graphical 
representation of a square figure. 
Why is the word ‘root’ (the root of a plant) used for the mathematical 
operation √ (square root, cube root, etc.)?
It is because, in ancient India, the Sanskrit word mula, meaning 
root of a plant, basis, cause, origin, etc., was used for the mathematical 
operations of taking roots.
In Sanskrit, varga-mula (the basis, cause, origin of the square) was 
used for square-root and ghana-mula was used for cube-root. This use of 
mula for the mathematical concept of root was subsequently emulated 
in Arabic and Latin through their corresponding words for the root of 
a plant — jidhr and radix respectively. The term mula for root has been 
used in India at least from the first century BCE.  Another term used was 
pada (foot, basis, cause, origin). Brahmagupta (628 CE) explains, ‘The 
pada (root) of a krti (square) is that of which it is a square.’


A number obtained by multiplying a number by itself is called 
a square number. Squares of natural numbers are called 
perfect squares.
	

All perfect squares end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9. Squares can only 
have an even number of zeros at the end.
	

Square root is the inverse operation of square. Every perfect 
square has two integral square roots. The positive square root 
of a number is denoted by the symbol √ . For example, √9 = 3.
	

A number obtained by multiplying a number by itself three 
times is called a cube. For example 1, 8, 27, ... ,etc., are cubes.
	

A number is a perfect square if its prime factors can be split 
into two identical groups.

SUMMARY
Look at the following numbers: 3    6    10    15    1
They are arranged such that each pair of adjacent numbers adds up to 
a square. 
3 + 6 = 9, 6 + 10 = 16, 10 + 15 = 25, 15 + 1 = 16.
Try arranging the numbers 1 to 17 (without repetition) in a row in a 
similar way — the sum of every adjacent pair of numbers should be a 
square. 
Can you arrange them in more than one way? If not, can you explain 
why?
Can you do the same with numbers from 1 to 32 (again, without 
repetition), but this time arranging all the numbers in a circle?
