Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony
In several parts of India, particularly in states like Odisha, 
Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, and Chhattisgarh, elephants 
often enter farms and villages. When vegetation is scarce and 
waterholes dry up in their natural habitat, elephants may wander 
in to nearby farms or plantations in search of food like bananas 
and sugarcane. This can lead to in crop damage and at times, even 
harm people and domestic animals. 
Changes in rainfall and temperature affect vegetation. Cutting 
down trees for constructing roads and buildings makes it worse. 
This leads to the shrinking and drying of forests, the natural home 
of animals. When forests cannot support wildlife, animals tend to 
move into human habitats. Elephants are adapted to forest life, 
but sudden changes make it hard for them to survive. Wildlife 
ecologists have identified  and marked corridors in many parts of 
the country to allow safe movement of animals. These corridors 
correct forest habitats, enabling wildlife—such as elephants to 
travel in need between large forest areas without coming into 
conflict with human settlements.
This chain of events shows how closely nature’s elements are 
connected. To understand such interconnections, we must study 
the components of our environment.
12.1 How Do We Experience and Interpret 
Our Surroundings?
You have learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Diversity in the 
Living World’ that different habitats have different kinds of plants 
and animals. A habitat is simply place where an organism lives. 
It could even be just the bark of a tree. The plants and animals 
interact with each other and adapt to survive in the surrounding 
conditions they live in. Explore two nearby habitats and identify 
both the living organisms and the non-living components in each.
Activity 12.1: Let us explore
Caution: Explore the habitat in groups with your teacher.
	
z Identify two habitats in your surroundings. 
	
z These could be any two of the following: a pond, a forest, an 
agricultural farm, or even a large tree like banyan, mango, 
or pilkhan (white fig) tree.
	
z List the living beings and non-living things that you observe 
in these habitats.
	
z Record your observations in Table 12.1.

Table 12.1: Diﬀerent components of two habitats
What common characteristics do 
you observe in the two habitats in 
Activity 12.1? The similarities are that 
both habitats have living beings as 
well as non-living things. However, 
the types of living beings are different 
and the non-living things also vary. 
The living beings you have recorded 
in Table 12.1 are termed as the 
biotic components and non-living 
things as the abiotic components of 
a habitat. Have you wondered why 
some organisms live on land while 
others live in water? Every organism 
needs specific conditions to survive. 
From this activity, you can see that 
different 
habitats 
offer 
different 
living conditions.
In Activity 12.1, you listed fish as 
a biotic component of the pond. How 
do fish survive in a pond? A pond 
provides food, oxygen, shelter, and 
space to grow — conditions essential 
for survival of organisms. Fish obtain 
their biotic needs, such as food, from 
small plants and animals, and abiotic 
needs, such as oxygen, from water.
Other living beings also inhabit the pond, such as frogs, fresh 
turtles, snakes, dragonflies, mosquitos, snails, and ducks, along 
with plants like algae, diatoms, duckweeds, and lotus. They all 
interact with the other living beings and non-living things present 
in the places where they grow and thrive. 
(a) Pond habitat
Fig. 12.1: Two types of habitats
(b) Forest habitat
Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony
Each habitat has its own biotic components and physical 
conditions — air, sunlight, water, temperature, and soil. 
Different organisms living in the same habitat may use the 
resources in different ways. A forest might be warm during 
the day and cool at night. A snake that comes out at night and a 
rodent active during the day both live in the same habitat, but they 
face different conditions. This is how living organisms coexist in 
harmony in the same habitat.
12.2 Who All Live Together in Nature? 
You have observed fish in a pond in Activity 12.1. Did you see 
only a single fish? Most likely, you may have seen many fish of 
the same kind. This group of fish of the same kind living together 
in a pond habitat is called a population of that particular fish. 
In this way, we can observe and record populations of different 
kinds of organisms in a single habitat. 
Activity 12.2: Let us record
We can understand the population of a particular type of plant 
by counting them at a given place and time. 
	
z Divide students into four to five groups. 
	
z Each group may identify any two organisms, plant(s) or 
animal(s).
	
z Mark an area of 1 m × 1 m in your school garden.
	
z Identify four organisms in this area, and count their numbers. 
	
z Record the number of the organisms in Table 12.2.
	
z Compile the data from all groups.
Name of organism
Population (Number of individual 
organisms)
Plant 1:	
Plant 2 :	
Animal 1 :	
Animal 2 :	
Table 12.2: Number of particular organisms at a given space 
and time
In the given example, there is a population of 20 ______ 
plants and is only 5 ______ plants in the same 1 × 1 m2 area. 
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
From Activity 12.2, we can explain that the population is a group 
of the same type of organisms in a habitat at a given time. 
Can a habitat have only one type of living organism? What might 
happen then? If all organisms are the same, they would have the 
same requirements — food, water, space — leading to competition and 
possible scarcity of resources. What else do you think could happen?
In Activities 12.1 and 12.2, you observed that different 
group of organisms live together in a habitat. A community 
comprises different populations sharing the same habitat. The 
biotic components of a habitat, such as the plants, animals, and 
microorganisms together form the community. These organisms 
interact and depend on one another for survival.
Ever heard of ...
You may have seen brightly coloured flowers blooming around you. 
Have you ever looked closely at their parts? A flower has a stalk, green 
leafy structures called sepals, coloured petals and two reproductive 
parts. Carpels (female) and stamens (male). 
Stamens burst release yellow dust like pollen 
grains. Wind, ‘water insects, bats and birds  helps 
carry pollen from the stamens to the carpels of 
the same and different flowers. This process is 
called pollination (Fig.12.2). It is essential for 
the formation of fruits and seeds.
Fig. 12.2: Insect 
pollination 
12.3 Does Every Organism in a Community 
Matter?
Let us find out the role of different organisms in a community.
Activity 12.3: Let us read
	
z Researchers conducted a study to see how fish in ponds 
affect seed production in the plants nearby. They observed 
Fig. 12.3: Pond A with fish and Pond B without fish 
Pond A
Pond B
Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony
two ponds — A with fish and large number 
of flowering plants around it; B without 
fish and fewer flowering plants around 
it (Fig. 12.3). Think of a reason for these 
observations.
	
z Compare 
the 
number 
of 
dragonflies, 
bees, and butterflies in both the ponds. 
Do you find any relationship between the 
number of dragonflies and bees/butterflies? 
We  observed that in Pond A (with fish) 
the number of dragonflies were less as 
compared to Pond B. Why?
	
z Fish eat dragonfly larvae, so ponds with fish 
had fewer dragonflies. Dragonflies usually 
eat flies, bees and butterflies With fewer 
dragonflies, more bees, flies, and butterflies 
were found. These insects help pollinate flowers from nearby 
areas moving pollen from one flower to another, which helps 
plants produce seeds. So, flowers near ponds with fish may 
produce more seeds than those near ponds without fish.
	
z What does this study show? How does the population of fish 
in a pond affect the seed production in nearby plants?  
	
z This study shows how biotic components (fish, dragonflies, 
pollinators, plants) and abiotic components (temperature, 
water, nutrients) interact with and affect each other 
(Fig. 12.4). Similarly, can overfishing by humans change this 
balance? How do you think it may affect the living and 
non-living parts of the habitat?
12.4 What Are the Different Types of Interactions 
Among Organisms and their Surroundings?
In Curiosity, Grade 7, you learn about how 
plants and animals need air, water, soil, and 
sunlight to grow. Living organisms, or the biotic 
community, depend on non-living things, that 
is abiotic components for their survival. Plants 
and animals also depend on each other for 
nutrition, respiration, and reproduction. These are 
interactions among the biotic components. Both 
types of interactions — among biotic components, 
and between biotic and abiotic components — are 
important for survival in any habitat.

Table 12.3: Interaction of biotic and abiotic components 
in a habitat
Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony
In Activity 12.4, you understood different 
types of interactions  occur within a habitat. From 
this, you can infer that the biotic components 
(plants, animals, and microorganisms) and the 
abiotic components (air, water, soil, sunlight, 
and temperature) in a habitat interact with each 
other to form an ecosystem. Organisms in an 
ecosystem interact with abiotic components 
for 
food, 
shelter, 
and 
protection 
in 
an 
ecosystem. Different communities of living 
organisms interact with abiotic components 
in an ecosystems. There are two main types 
of ecosystems in nature. Aquatic ecosystems 
include ponds, rivers, and lakes while terrestrial 
ecosystems include forests, farms or even large trees like banyan, 
mango, or pilkhan. Hence, ecosystems can be large or small. Can 
you find overlapping ecosystems in Fig. 12.6? 
Fig. 12.6 shows an overlap of different terrestrial and 
aquatic ecosystems. In this figure, you can see a small river (an 
aquatic ecosystem) along with mountains, forests, grassland, 
and farmland, which are examples of terrestrial ecosystems. 
Farmland is a human-made ecosystem. These ecosystems are 
interacting with each other at any given point.
In Activity 12.4, we have seen the importance of the components 
and their interactions in an ecosystem. For example, sunlight, 
carbon dioxide, and water are essential for producing food in plants; 
soil provides medium and essential nutrients for plant growth; air 
provides oxygen for respiration in plants as well as animals; water is 
essential for all living organisms. This shows how living organisms 
depend on the non-living component of an ecosystem.
Just as biotic components depend on abiotic components, abiotic 
components also depend on biotic components. For example, 
plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, roots hold soil in 
place and prevent erosion, and plants retain soil moisture and 
help cool the atmosphere.
You can identify and study any ecosystem in your surroundings 
and observe different types of interactions among the biotic and 
abiotic components. While studying biotic interactions, notice 
how organisms depend on each other for food.

z Using the internet or your school library, find out what do 
these organisms eat.

Table 12.4:  Eating habits of different organisms 
How do plants get their food? As you know, plants make their 
own food by the process of photosynthesis. Thus, they are called 
producers or autotrophs (auto=self + troph=food).
Organisms that cannot produce their own food and depend 
on other organisms for their food are called consumers or 
heterotrophs (hetero = other + troph = food). List the heterotrophs 
from Table 12.4.
Organisms that eat only plants are called herbivores, such 
as deer and hare. Those that eat only animals are carnivores, 
such as leopard. Organisms that eat both plants and animals are 
omnivores, such as crows, foxes, and mice.
12.5 Who Eats Whom?
In Activity 12.5, we learn about the feeding relationship 
among organisms. How can we make linkages with the feeding 
relationship among organisms in a given ecosystem? 
Fig. 12.8: Food chain
Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony
Activity 12.6: Let us link (relate)
	
z Take an example of a grassland ecosystem. 
	
z Consider the following organisms that we can spot in a 
grassland ecosystem: grass, frog, hare, fox, grasshopper, 
snake, and eagle.
	
z In Fig. 12.8, a relationship of who eats whom is shown among 
some of the organisms.
	
z Draw the feeding relationships for the remaining organisms by 
adding arrows, similar to those in Fig. 12.8.
In Fig 12.8, you can see that the grass is eaten by the hare and the 
hare is eaten by the fox. This is a representation of a food chain 
in a grassland ecosystem. Which is another food chain that can 
be drawn for the organisms given in this activity? One example 
may be as follows: 
Grass 
 Grasshopper 
 Frog 
 Snake 
 Eagle
The interactions between biotic components based on feeding 
relationships can be represented in the form of a linear chain. 
A food chain is a simple sequence showing ‘who eats whom’ in 
an ecosystem. One such example is given in Fig. 12.9. 
Activity 12.7: Let us draw

the organisms.

order, consider the highest number at 
the base and the lowest at the top.

specific position, called a trophic level 
(troph = food):

the first trophic level.

z How many other organisms 
might be connected to one 
organism through a feeding 
relationship in an ecosystem?
Look 
at 
Fig. 
12.11, 
and 
observe 
the 
relationship 
between different food chains 
in an ecosystem. Are these food 
chains interlinked? Each of the 
organisms may be eaten by two 
or more types of organisms. 
Thus, in an ecosystem, the food 
chains are interlinked with each 
other to form a network, called a 
food web. 
You know that living organisms 
grow, perform many functions, 
develop, and die. During their life 
cycle, organisms produce a lot of 
waste, including dead matter and 
food waste.
12.6 What Happens to Waste in Nature? 
You may have seen small umbrella-like structures, 
mushrooms, growing on dead plants or trees during the 
rainy season (Fig.  12.12). These are a type of fungi that 
grow on dead matter. Microorganisms like fungi and 
bacteria break down complex substances in dead plants 
and animals into simpler ones. This  process returns 
Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony
important nutrients to the soil. You can also find tiny insects, 
such as beetles and flies, on animal droppings — like elephant 
dung— as they help break it down and recycle nutrients, back into 
the environment. This process is called decomposition and the 
organisms carrying out the process are called decomposers or 
saprotrophs (sapro= rotten + trophs = food). Plants grow in soil 
and many of the nutrients in soil come from the decomposition 
process. Thus, decomposers play an important role in recycling 
nutrients. In nature, nothing is wasted — everything is reused. 
Does nature really waste anything?
Ever heard of ...
India is a country with diverse habitats and seasons. Many migratory 
birds fly thousands of miles and reach different habitats in India. They 
migrate from different parts of the world to avoid harsh climate, and in 
search for food. Birds not only enhance the aesthetics of those habitats 
but also play a significant role in keeping the balance in an ecosystem 
as pollinators or seed dispersers along the path they migrate. This 
way they link two habitats. These birds are predators of insect pests 
and help farmers to control pest populations, and indirectly help 
in healthy crop growth. Migratory birds, Demoiselle Crane visit the 
water body of Khichan village in Jodhpur district during the winter 
months. Do you know which birds in your area are seen only during 
winter? Collect postal stamps and covers of migratory birds released 
by the Indian Postal Department, and collect information about their 
place of origin and reasons for their migration to different localities 
in India and more. Showcase the postal stamps in your science 
laboratory/school library to popularise migratory birds.
12.7 How Does One Change Lead to Another? 
Look at Fig. 12.13. It shows how one small change can lead to 
many others. For example, many plants in a pond start dying 
because of pollution. With fewer plants less oxygen will be 
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
produced in water which will lead to a drop in the 
fish population in that water body. Reduction in fish 
population will have cascading effects and there will 
be less number of consumers in the pond. As a result, 
insects will increase in number. These insects will 
spread to nearby farmlands. This is how farmers will 
be compelled to use pesticides to grow their crops 
which may again adversely affect the environment. 
Further consequences may emerge in the form of 
other environmental issues.
Plants die
Less oxygen
Fish die
More insects
Plants get 
damaged by 
pests

What happens when we intervene in nature?
Activity 12.9: Let us read
In the 1980s, India was a significant exporter of frog 
legs, especially of the Indian bullfrog (Hoplobatrachus 
tigerinus) (Fig. 12.14). This large-scale harvesting led 
to a decline in frog populations. Since frogs eat insects, 
their reduced numbers resulted in a rise in agricultural 
pests. This forced farmers to use more synthetic 
pesticides, which harmed the environment, soil and 
water quality, and affected the overall environmental 
and human health. The Government of India banned 
the export of frog legs to prevent further ecological 
damage. 
An ecosystem stays in balance when interactions 
among organisms and their environment keep 
populations and resources stable. This balance is 
dynamic, not fixed, and can be disrupted by natural 
or human-made changes.
Fig. 12.14: Indian bullfrog
Fig. 12.15: Competition among a 
community in an ecosystem
12.8 How Do Interactions Maintain 
Balance in Ecosystems?
Besides feeding relationships, organisms also 
compete for common resources like food, water, 
physical space, or sunlight.  
This competition helps control population 
size and keeps the ecosystem balanced. Without 
it, one species could multiply too much causing 
an imbalance in the ecosystem (Fig. 12.15).
There are other types of relationships too. 
Based on the example given in Fig. 12.16, what 
do you observe?

Asir Jawahar Thomas Johnsingh (A.J.T. Johnsingh) 
was a famous Indian wildlife biologist who helped 
us understand forest ecosystems through the eyes of 
animals. He was a pioneer in studying wildlife through 
modern tracking system. His research showed how 
predators like tigers and leopards rely on prey, such as 
deer and wild boar, while he was working in Bandipur 
National Park, Karnataka. He proved that a healthy prey 
population is key to predator survival. He inspired many youngsters 
to study wildlife and protect the forests and biodiversity of India.
12.9 What Are the Benefits of an Ecosystem?
We have learnt that biotic components and abiotic components 
of an ecosystem depend on each other and support various life 
processes. Humans also benefit from ecosystems. For example, 
forests provide fresh air, fertile soil, food, fibres, timber, and 
medicines. Similarly, aquatic ecosystems provide water and 
food. Ecosystems also offer aesthetic and recreational value. 
This benefits and supports our well-being and shows how closely 
nature and humans are connected. However, when we overuse 
or misuse natural resources, we disturb the balance in nature.
Now let us look at a real-life example of a threatened ecosystem 
— the Sundarbans.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
The 
Sundarbans 
have 
the 
largest mangrove forests in the 
world. Located where the Ganges 
and 
Brahmaputra 
Rivers 
meet 
between India and Bangladesh, the 
Sundarbans’ forests and rivers are 
home to various flora and fauna, 
many of which are endangered. The 
Sundarbans protect us by slowing 
down strong winds and waves 
during storms and floods. The trees 
also absorb carbon dioxide from 
the air and release oxygen. Because 
of its importance, The United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the Sundarbans a World 
Heritage Site in 1987. However, the Sundarbans (Fig.  12.17) are 
under a serious threat. Mangrove trees are being cut for fuelwood 
and farming. Illegal hunting and overuse of forest resources are 
a threat to the wildlife living there. Pollution from industrial 
waste and untreated sewage in rivers are also damaging the 
water and habitat. These human activities disrupt the natural way 
ecosystems work.
Similarly, other ecosystems across India are also under threat. 
Problems like deforestation, overuse of natural resources, the 
spread of invasive species, unsustainable land use, and pollution 
are damaging forests, rivers, scrublands, wetlands, grasslands, 
and coastal areas.
How can we stop damaging forests, rivers, and wetlands? 
Think about what actions you and your community can take to 
protect these important places.
Protected areas are parts of land or water set aside to conserve wildlife 
and their habitats. India has many protected areas like national parks, 
wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and community conserved 
areas. These places help protect entire habitats including endangered 
animals, birds, and many rare plants. Famous examples include Jim 
Corbett National Park (Uttarakhand), Manas National Park (Assam), 
Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (Western Ghats), Chilika Lake (Odisha), 
Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh), Hemis National 
Park (Leh), Keibul Lamjao National Park (Manipur), Pirotan Island 
Marine National Park (Gujarat). Protected areas play a big role in 
saving nature for future generations.

12.9.1 Human-made ecosystems
Humans have created artificial ecosystems like fish ponds, 
farms, and parks to meet their needs. When well designed, these 
can help reduce pollution, support biodiversity, and provide 
recreational spaces for people. Unlike natural ecosystems, these 
need human care and management. Can you name any human 
made ecosystem in your area?
12.9.2 How do healthy ecosystems serve our farms?
Farming, a major livelihood in India, can become unsustainable 
if not managed well by applying environment friendly farming 
practices.
Humans have been practising farming for thousands of 
years to grow food. As the population grew, our dependence on 
agriculture increased. Between 1950 and 1965, India faced a food 
crisis due to low crop production. In the mid-20th century, the 
use of tractors, machines, synthetic fertilisers, and pesticides 
helped increase food production. This period is known as the 
Green Revolution. However, these farming methods are now 
considered unsustainable because of the overuse of synthetic 
chemicals, excessive groundwater extraction, and growing only 
one type of crop for commercial gain. How do these practices 
harm both the environment and human health?
Many scientists believe that overusing pesticides and growing 
the same type of crop repeatedly on the same land leads to soil 
degradation. Understanding ecosystems can help us adopt better 
and more sustainable farming practices.
Activity 12.10: Let us survey
Visit a nearby farm with your parents or teacher/interact with 
farmers in your community to find out about the farming 
practices they adopt.
	
z Prepare a list of questions for farmers to find out the 
pesticides and other farm inputs they use, and whether they 
reuse or recycle materials to improve their crops. Here are 
some sample questions:
	
{
How have your farming practices changed over time? 
And why?
	
{
What effects do you notice when using synthetic fertilisers 
and pesticides?
	
{
Have you seen any changes in soil health after using these 
synthetic fertilisers and pesticides?
	
z Interact with farmers based on these questions. Based on 
your findings, prepare a report.

What inference do you draw from your 
interactions with farmers?
Synthetic fertilisers and pesticides have played 
a vital role in improving crop production and 
helped countries like India become food secure. 
However, their long-term use can affect the 
environment and soil health. Overuse of synthetic 
fertilisers may reduce soil fertility by decreasing 
friendly microorganisms in soil and lowering 
organic matter (humus), which helps bind soil 
particles. Without enough humus, soil becomes 
prone to erosion. Also, it reduces the population of 
natural predators which ultimately increase the 
population of pests (Fig. 12.18). Heavy irrigation and repeated 
ploughing can also disturb soil organisms like earthworms and 
snails, which are important for maintaining ecological balance.
Some pests may develop resistance to pesticides, making them 
difficult to control. Growing the same crop repeatedly, known as 
monoculture, can reduce crop diversity and affect pollinators, 
which are crucial for food production. 
To make farming more sustainable, some farmers are 
exploring organic and natural farming methods. These aim to 
reduce the use of synthetic fertilisers and support sustainable 
farming, with minimal interference in natural ecosystems. 
Based on your learning, what practices do you think can help 
farmers protect the soil, the environment, and our food security 
for the future?
The ancient text Vrikshayurveda emphasises on soil health and 
nourishment. The text strongly advocates for the continuous 
nourishment of the soil through organic manure like Kunapa Jala (a 
liquid fertiliser made from animal and plant waste by the process of 
fermentation; that breaks complex substances into simpler ones) and 
other composted materials.


A habitat is a place that provides the right conditions for an organism 
to live and grow.

predators—Beetle feeding on pests
Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony
	

Habitats have biotic components (plants, animals, microbes) and 
abiotic components (air, water, soil, temperature).
	

The interaction between biotic components and abiotic components 
in an area forms an ecosystem.
	

Ecosystems can be terrestrial (forests, grasslands, deserts) or aquatic 
(ponds, lakes, sea, oceans).
	

Organisms often classified as producers (plants), consumers 
(herbivores, carnivores, omnivores), and decomposers (bacteria, 
fungi).
	

Producers make their own food, while consumers eat plants 
or animals. Decomposers break down dead matter and recycle 
nutrients.
	

Food chains depict who eats whom in an ecosystem, and food webs 
show how these chains are interconnected. The positions that 
different organisms occupy in a food chain are called trophic levels.
	

Some organisms live in relationships, like mutualism (both benefit), 
commensalism (one benefits, other is unaffected), and parasitism 
(one benefits, one is harmed).
	

The benefits that ecosystems offer are crucial for human survival 
and well-being. They provide clean air, water, food, medicine, and 
climate regulation.
	

Human activities like pollution, deforestation, habitat loss, climate 
change, invasive species, and overexploitation of natural resources 
threaten ecosystems. Protecting them through efforts, such as 
conservation like national parks and sanctuaries is vital.

1.	 Refer to the given diagram (Fig. 12.19) and select the wrong 
statement. 
(i)	 A community is larger than a population.
(ii)	 A community is smaller than an ecosystem.
(iii)	 An ecosystem is part of a community.
2.	 A population is part of a community. If all decomposers 
suddenly disappear from a forest ecosystem, what changes 
do you think would occur? Explain why decomposers are 
essential.
3.	 Selvam from Cuddalore district, Tamil Nadu, shared that 
his village was less affected by the 2004 Tsunami compared 
to nearby villages due to the presence of mangrove forests. 
This surprised Sarita, Shabnam, and Shijo. They wondered 
if mangroves were protecting the village. Can you help them 
understand this?
