Chapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses
During the summer holidays, Meena went to a science centre with 
her family. The centre had many fascinating displays on nature, 
space, and technology. While her parents explored a section on 
saving water and electricity, Meena and her brother wandered off 
to look around. In one corner, Meena noticed a row of unusual, 
curved mirrors. Curious, she stepped closer and looked into one. 
Her face appeared unusually large, while her brother, standing 
a little farther away, looked upside down! At another mirror, she 
saw a tiny version of herself. Meena was puzzled.
She remembered doing activities with a mirror earlier where 
the image formed by the mirror was of the same size as the object 
and was erect (in the chapter ‘Light: Shadows and Reflections’ 
in Curiosity, Grade 7). Seeing her confusion, a guide from the 
science centre walked up to her and smiled. “These are not plane 
mirrors,” the guide explained. “These are spherical mirrors. 
When the mirror is curved inward or outward, your image looks 
different in them!” Meena’s curiosity grew and she decided to 
talk to her teacher about these spherical mirrors.
10.1 What Are Spherical Mirrors?
Activity 10.1: Let us explore
	
z Take a shiny metallic spoon and hold its 
curved surface close to your face. Can you 
see your image in it?
	
z Notice the image of your face. Is it different 
from the image you see in a plane mirror? 
	
z While observing the image, slowly move the 
spoon away from your face. Do you observe 
any change in the image?
	
z Now flip the spoon and repeat the same steps.
Did you notice that the shiny metallic spoon acted 
like a mirror and you could see your image in it? 
When you looked at the inner side of the spoon which is curved 
inwards, you must have observed that the image was inverted 
(Fig. 10.1a). When you looked at the outer side of the spoon which 
bulges outwards, the image of your face was erect but smaller in 
size (Fig. 10.1b). 
Curved mirrors, like the spoon, can also be specially made. 
Spherical mirrors are a common type of curved mirrors which 
are shaped like a part of a hollow glass sphere. Mirrors, whose 
reflecting surfaces are spherical are called spherical mirrors.

metallic spoon from its (a) Inner curved 
surface; (b) Outer curved surface
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
The reflecting surface of the spherical mirror may be curved 
inwards or outwards. A spherical mirror, which has a reflecting 
surface that curves inwards, is called a concave mirror 
(Fig. 10.2a). Its schematic representation is shown in Fig. 10.2b. 
The outline of the surface of the mirror is circular.

Fig. 10.3: (a) Convex mirror; 
(b) Its representation
A spherical mirror which has a reflecting surface that curves 
outwards is called a convex mirror (Fig. 10.3a). Its schematic 
representation is shown in Fig. 10.3b.
In the representation of both the mirrors, the non-reflecting 
surface of the mirror is shown as shaded.
A step further
The shape of a spherical mirror is such that it can be thought of as 
a part of an imaginary hollow sphere. However, remember that 
spherical mirrors are not made by slicing a hollow glass sphere. 
Instead, they are created by grinding and polishing a flat glass 
piece into a curved surface. If a reflective coating (like a thin layer 
of aluminium) is applied on the outer curved surface, it forms 
a concave mirror. If the coating is applied on the inner curved 
surface, it forms a convex mirror.

Activity 10.2: Let us distinguish
	
z Place concave and convex mirrors on a table 
with their reflecting surfaces facing upwards. 
	
z Now view them from the side, keeping your 
eye at their level, to identify whether the 
reflecting surface is curved inwards or 
outwards (Fig. 10.4).

10.2 What Are the Characteristics of Images 
Formed by Spherical Mirrors?
Activity 10.3: Let us explore
	
z Take a concave mirror, a convex 
mirror, two small wooden blocks 
or something similar to place the 
mirrors in an upright position, and 
a small toy or some other object.
	
z Place the two mirrors side by side 
in an upright position on a table. 
Keep the object in front of them at 
a small distance (3–4 cm away) as 
shown in Fig. 10.5a. What kind of 
images do you see in each mirror? 
Are the images of the same size as 
the object? Are they erect? Do you 
see lateral inversion in the images? 
Write down your observations in your notebook.
	
z Now slowly move the object away from the mirrors. What 
changes do you see in the images in both the mirrors? Do 
the images become smaller or larger? Do they continue to be 
erect? Again, note down your observations.
	
z Repeat the steps with each mirror individually.
	
z Analyse your observations and draw conclusions.
How can we distinguish 
between concave and 
convex mirrors?

In the concave mirror, when the object is placed close to the 
mirror, the image is erect but larger than the object in size, that is, 
enlarged. However, when the object is moved farther away, the 
image becomes inverted. Initially, the image is enlarged in size  and 
then keeps getting smaller. In case of a convex mirror, the image 
is always erect and smaller than the object, that is diminished. 
However, the size of the image decreases slightly as the object is 
moved away from the convex mirror. 
This activity shows that spherical mirrors (concave and 
convex) behave differently from plane mirrors. A plane mirror 
always forms an erect image of the same size as the object. 
However, in the concave and convex mirrors, the size of the 
image changes as the distance of the object from the mirror 
changes. In addition, in the case of a concave mirror, the image 
also gets inverted when the object is taken away from the mirror. 
Lateral inversion of the image is seen in all three types of mirrors. 
I just got an idea. We can also identify 
whether a mirror is plane, or concave, 
or convex by looking at the images of an 
object formed in them!
Yes. But where do we 
find concave and convex 
mirrors being used in 
our surroundings?
The reflectors of torches, headlights of cars 
and scooters are concave in shape (Fig. 10.6a).
Have you ever noticed a dental mirror used by 
a dentist for inspecting teeth? It is a concave 
mirror which provides an enlarged view of teeth 
when held close to the teeth inside the mouth 
(Fig. 10.6b). 
A step further
Do you remember learning about the use of telescope in the chapter 
‘Beyond Earth’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? Most modern telescopes are 
reflecting telescope that use curved mirrors, with the main mirror 
being a large concave mirror. 
Look at the side-view mirrors on vehicles. These mirrors are 
convex. They always form an erect image of the traffic behind and 
smaller than the actual vehicles. Also, since the convex mirror is 
Fig. 10.6: Use of concave mirror (a) As a 
reflector of a torch; (b) By a dentist

Chapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses
curved outside, it provides a much wider area of the road behind. 
Further, such convex mirrors are installed at road intersections 
or sharp bends to provide drivers 
from both sides the visibility of the 
other side and prevent collisions. 
Convex mirrors are also installed 
in big stores to monitor a large 
area to deter thefts.
10.3 What Are the Laws of Reflection?
Let us now repeat an activity which we did earlier in grade 7, 
but this time we will extend it further. Do you remember doing 
the activity for observing the reflection of a beam of light from a 
plane mirror?
Activity 10.4: Let us experiment
We have observed images formed by 
three types of mirrors — plane, concave, 
and convex. But are there any laws 
which govern the image formation?

mirror (a) At one angle; 
(b) At another angle

z Collect a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a 
comb, a paper clip to hold the comb upright, a 
sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper.
	
z As you did earlier, make a thin slit by covering 
all openings of the comb using black paper, 
except for one in the middle.
	
z Spread a sheet of white paper on a table. Place 
the plane mirror upright on it.
	
z Using the thin slit and torch, obtain a thin beam 
of light along the paper and adjust it to fall upon 
the mirror as shown in Fig. 10.8a.
	
z Now, move the slit and torch slightly so that the 
beam of light falls at a different angle on the 
mirror (Fig. 10.8b). Does the reflected beam of 
light also shift?

Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
	
z Make the beam of light fall on the mirror at different angles 
and observe how the direction of the reflected beam changes.
To understand this better, let us draw this on a paper, step by 
step. But before doing that, let us learn how to represent light. 
We often represent light by straight lines with arrows, or rays. 
Rays indicate the path along which light travels. Do you remember 
learning earlier that the light travels along a straight line?
	
z Draw a line showing the position of the plane mirror. 
Also, draw lines with arrows (rays) indicating the beam of 
light falling on the mirror and the reflected beam of light as 
shown in Fig. 10.9a.
The ray of light that falls on the mirror is called the incident 
ray. The ray of light that comes back from the mirror is called the 
reflected ray.
	
z Now remove the mirror. From the point where the incident 
ray strikes the mirror, draw a line making an angle of 90° to the 
line representing the mirror. This line is known as the normal 
to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, O (Fig. 10.9b).
The angle between the normal and the incident ray is called 
the angle of incidence (i) (Fig. 10.9c). The angle between the 
normal and the reflected ray is known as the angle of reflection 
(r) (Fig. 10.9c). 
	
z On your drawing, measure the angle of incidence and the 
angle of reflection and note it in Table 10.1. 
	
z Repeat the activity several times by changing the angle of 
incidence. 
	
z Finally, let the incident beam fall on the mirror along the 
normal and observe the direction of the reflected beam. 
What would be the angle of incidence and angle of reflection 
in this case? Both the angles would be zero in this case.
S.No.
Angle of incidence (i )
Angle of reflection (r )
Table 10.1: Measuring angles of incidence and reflection
Do you notice that both angles in Table 10.1 are nearly 
equal? If done carefully, the experiment shows that the angle of 
incidence (i) is equal to the angle of reflection (r). This is a law 
of reflection.

Activity 10.5: Let us experiment
	
z Use the same setup as in Activity 10.4, 
but place a stiff sheet of chart paper flat 
on a table such that part of it extends 
beyond the edge of the table.
	
z Shine a beam of light on the mirror 
placed on the sheet and observe the 
reflected beam on the extended portion 
(Fig. 10.10a).
	
z Now, bend the extended part of the sheet 
along the edge of the table. Do you still 
see the reflected beam on the extended 
portion?
	
z Flatten the paper again and observe.
The reflected beam disappears when the 
sheet is bent but reappears when it is 
flattened again. This shows that the reflected 
beam lies in the same plane as that of the 
incident beam. Bending the sheet creates a 
new plane, breaking this alignment.
The incident ray, the normal to the 
mirror at the point of incidence, and the 
reflected ray, all lie in the same plane. 
This is another law of reflection.
A step further
In the two cases, even though the directions of incident rays are 
different, they fall at the same point on the mirror, and thus, the 
directions of normal are the same. However, the direction of the 
reflected ray is such that the incident ray, the normal at the point of 
incidence, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane in both cases.

The laws of reflection are valid for all kinds of 
mirrors — plane and spherical. But if multiple 
parallel rays fall on the spherical mirrors, we 
observe something interesting.
Are laws of reflection 
applicable to spherical 
mirrors also?
Activity 10.6: Let us explore
	
z Collect a plane mirror, a concave mirror, a convex 
mirror, stand for mirrors, a torch, a comb, and a 
paper clip to hold the comb upright.
	
z Use the same setup as Activity 10.4 again, but instead 
of a single slit, leave many openings of the comb 
uncovered to obtain multiple parallel beams of light 
(Fig. 10.11a).
	
z Let the multiple parallel beams of light fall upon the 
plane mirror, concave mirror, and convex mirror, 
one by one. Observe the reflected beams. Is your 
observation similar to what is shown in Fig. 10.11 
(b), (c), and (d)?
When multiple parallel beams of light fall upon a plane 
mirror, the multiple reflected beams are also parallel 
(Fig. 10.11b). However, when multiple beams of light fall 
upon a concave mirror, the multiple reflected beams get 
closer, that is, they converge (Fig. 10.11c). Whereas, in 
the case of a convex mirror, the multiple reflected beams 
spread, that is, they diverge (Fig. 10.11d). 
In the case of spherical mirrors, even though each 
ray of light follows the laws of reflection, the curved 
surface of spherical mirrors causes the parallel beam of 
rays to either converge (concave) or diverge (convex) on 
reflection depending on the shape of the mirror.
A step further
If we draw what we observed in Activity 10.6, we get the 
figures like those shown below.

So, the concave mirror 
converges a light beam 
while the convex mirror 
diverges it. This is indeed 
interesting!
Since the concave 
mirror converges the 
light beam, wouldn’t 
light get concentrated 
in a small area?
Activity 10.7: Let us explore
Safety First
Safety first
Always perform this activity under the supervision of a teacher or 
an adult. Do not look towards the Sun or into the mirror reflecting 
the Sun. Focus the reflected light only on a piece of paper, not 
towards anyone’s face or eyes.
	
z Take a concave mirror and a sheet of thin paper 
or newspaper. 
	
z Hold the concave mirror with its reflecting surface 
facing the Sun. Direct the light of the Sun reflected 
by the mirror on the sheet of paper. 
	
z Adjust the distance of the paper until you get a 
sharp bright spot on it as shown in Fig. 10.12. 
	
z Hold the mirror and the sheet of paper steady 
for a few minutes. Does the paper start to burn 
producing smoke?
The bright spot is formed on the paper because light from the 
Sun, after reflection from the mirror, gets concentrated on this 
point. This produces sufficient heat at this point which can ignite 
the paper.
A step further
Devices which concentrate sunlight into a small area, using mirrors 
and lenses, are called solar concentrators. The concentrated sunlight 
is used to heat a liquid to produce steam which can be used to 
generate electricity or for providing heat for various purposes, such 
as large scale cooking or for solar furnaces. Solar furnaces are even 
used for melting steel! Do you remember learning in an earlier 
chapter, about electric furnaces for melting steel?

We explored the images of an 
object formed by curved mirrors. 
But how do objects look when 
viewed through transparent 
materials with curved surfaces?
10.4 What Is a Lens?
Imagine 
looking 
through 
a 
flat 
transparent glass window pane — all 
objects look the same size and shape. 
But would those objects continue to 
look the same if the surface of the 
transparent material is curved?
Activity 10.8: Let us explore
	
z Collect a flat strip of glass or clear plastic, such as a flat scale, 
few drops of oil, dropper, water, and a paper or book with 
some text printed on it.
	
z Spread a few drops of oil on the surface of glass or plastic 
strip and rub it to leave a very thin coating. You can also use 
wax instead of oil.
	
z Using a dropper or your finger, place a small drop of water 
on the oiled/waxed spot. (The oil/wax helps the water form a 
nice round drop.) 
	
z Examine the water drop. What is the shape of its surface? Is 
it flat or curved inward or curved outward?
	
z Place the paper underneath the glass/plastic strip such that 
the text is directly under the water drop (see Fig. 10.13).
	
z Now, look down through the water drop at the text below. Do 
you find some change in the size of the letters just below the 
water drop? Do they look enlarged or smaller?
The surface of the water drop is curved outside. The letters 
under the water drop look different — they might appear larger 
than the letters nearby! The curved surface of the water drop 
made the size of the text look different. This curved drop of water 
is acting like a simple lens. Have you seen a magnifying glass as 
shown in Fig. 10.14? It is also a lens that helps in reading small 
print by making the letters appear bigger.
A lens is a piece of transparent material, 
usually made of glass or plastic, which has 
curved surfaces. Like mirrors, lenses can also 
be convex or concave. 
A lens which is thicker at the middle as 
compared to the edges is called a convex lens 
(Fig. 10.15a).

Chapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses
A lens which is thicker at the edges as 
compared to the middle is called a concave 
lens (Fig. 10.16b).
Unlike mirrors, lenses allow light to pass 
through them, and we see things through a 
lens rather than in a lens.
What changes can be seen in the 
objects when viewed through lenses?
Activity 10.9: Let us experiment
	
z Collect a convex lens, a concave lens, a lens holder, and a 
small object.
	
z Take the convex lens and place it upright using its holder. 
	
z Place the object behind the convex lens (it may also be placed 
on something to bring it up to the level of the lens).
	
z Look at the object through the lens from the other side of 
the lens (Fig. 10.17a) and note your observations in your 
notebook. 
	
z Now slowly move the object farther from the lens and keep 
observing how the image changes. How does the distance of 
the object from the convex lens affect how it looks?
	
z Now repeat the steps using a concave lens.
	
z Analyse your observations recorded in your notebook 
and compare the images seen through both lenses. 
What conclusions do you draw?
When an object is placed behind a convex lens at a small 
distance from it and seen through the lens, the object appears 
erect and enlarged in size. As the distance between the object 
and the convex lens increases, the object appears inverted. It is 
initially enlarged in size and then diminishes in size. An object 
placed behind a concave lens and seen through the lens, always 
appears erect and diminished in size. Its size changes, as its 
distance from the lens increases.
Do lenses also converge or 
diverge the light beam?

Since convex lens converges a light 
beam, can it also burn a paper?
Activity 10.10: Let us investigate
	
z Collect a thin transparent glass plate, a convex lens, a concave 
lens, a torch and a comb to obtain multiple parallel beams of 
light, a paper clip to hold the comb upright, two identical 
books, and sheets of white paper.
	
z Using two books placed adjacent to each other, fix the glass 
plate or lens upright in between them as shown in Fig. 10.18. 
Spread paper sheets on both books.
	
z Now let the multiple parallel beams of light fall upon the 
thin glass plate, convex lens, and concave lens one by one 
as shown in Fig. 10.18. Does the parallel beam of light pass 
through as it is in all three cases?
	
z Record and analyse your observations.
The light beam passes through the thin glass plate as it is. 
The convex lens converges the light falling on it while the concave 
lens diverges the light. A convex lens is also called a converging 
lens while a concave lens is called a diverging lens.

Where all are the 
lenses used?
 
Lenses are important and are used 
everywhere around us. The eyeglasses that 
people wear to help them see clearly are 
lenses! Cameras, telescopes, and 
microscopes all use lenses to work. 
Even our eye has a convex lens 
inside it. It is quite an amazing lens 
that can change its shape, which is 
what allows us to read a book or see 
something far away.

12.	 Place a pencil behind a transparent glass tumbler 
(Fig.  10.28a). Now fill the tumbler halfway with water 
(Fig.  10.28b). How does the pencil appear when viewed 
through the water? Explain why its shape appears changed.
Discover, design, and debate
	
z Visit a nearby hospital or the clinic of an ENT specialist, or 
a dentist, with your teacher or parents. Request the doctor 
to show you the mirrors used for examining ear, nose, 
throat, and teeth. Identify the kind of mirror used in these 
instruments.
	
z Harnessing sunlight is key to 
solving future energy challenges. 
In 
devices 
like 
solar 
cookers 
(Fig. 10.29), mirrors are used to 
converge sunlight and generate 
heat. In India, such designs are used 
in villages, thus saving electricity 
and reducing fossil fuel use. Think 
of a design for a solar cooker for 
your school or home and prepare 
a detailed proposal for it including 
the budget required.
	
z Use online tools or animation to do virtual experiments with 
spherical mirrors and lenses. Move objects in the simulation 
and observe how the image changes.
Our scientific heritage
More than 800 years ago, during the time of the great Indian 
mathematician Bhāskara II, astronomers used shallow bowls of 
water to observe the stars and planets. By carefully looking at their 
reflected images through tubes placed at appropriate angles, they 
could measure the positions of stars and planets in the sky. Even 
though the laws of reflection are not mentioned in literature, their 
instruments and methods indicate that they might have understood 
it in practice!
