Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet
We have now reached the final chapter of this book, the 
concluding chapter in our scientific journey through the middle 
stage. It is time to put together all that we have seen and learnt 
and try to understand why our home, planet Earth, is like 
no other place in the known universe. As you have learnt in 
Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, the Earth is a planet orbiting the Sun. 
However, it is not just any planet. It is a planet that sustains 
life — full of diverse landscapes, from towering mountains 
and vast oceans to endless deserts and lush forests. Today, our 
satellites allow us to take amazing pictures of our planet. The 
image in the beginning  page was taken by an Indian Space 
Research Organisation (ISRO) Earth Observation Satellite and 
made by combining nearly 3000 smaller images, like pieces of 
a mosaic. Although it looks beautiful, it’s a false colour image, 
where scientists use different colours to show different types of 
information. These satellite images help us study plants on land 
and tiny organisms in the ocean, and can even detect things 
like ocean temperature, oil spills, and wind direction. In this 
chapter, we will uncover the unique conditions that make Earth 
the perfect home for living beings.
13.1 Why Is Earth a Unique Planet?
What makes the Earth so special? While there are perhaps 
billions of planets in the universe, Earth is the only one where 
life, as we know today, exists and thrives in all its forms.
Have you ever wondered 
where all life on Earth 
actually 
exists? 
All 
the 
mountains, rivers, forests, 
animals, and people are 
found on just a very thin 
layer on the surface of our 
planet. From the tallest 
mountain to the deepest 
ocean trench, the crust, 
where all of life exists, is 
tiny compared to the size of 
Earth. If Earth were the size 
of an apple, the crust would 
be as thin as the apple’s 
skin as shown in Fig. 13.1. 
This delicate, life supporting layer is what makes Earth truly 
special.

Table 13.1: Interesting features about the Earth
Discuss the features you have listed with your teacher and 
friends. You may realise that the Earth is interesting and important 
to us in many ways. It provides us with the air that we breathe, the 
water that we drink, and the soil that helps in growing crops. The 
Earth also provides us materials like rock and timber with which 
we build our homes, buildings, and roads. You must be curious 
to know what makes the Earth a unique planet which not only 
allows life like us to exist but also sustains it.
13.2 What Do the Planets of Our Solar System 
Look Like?
In Curiosity, Grade 6, you had studied the solar system in the 
chapter ‘Beyond Earth’. Let us recall some of the things we had 
learnt. Our solar system has eight planets that go around the Sun 
in nearly circular orbits. In order of their increasing distance 
from the Sun, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, 
I wonder what makes the Earth 
unique for living beings to grow 
and survive!
Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Out of all these planets, Mercury, 
Venus, Earth, and Mars, are relatively small and rocky planets, 
while Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are large planets, 
mostly made of gases.
Let us find out more about the planets in the solar system by 
performing Activity 13.2.

Table 13.2: Planets in our solar system
We know that all planets in the solar system get their energy 
from the Sun. Thus, when a planet is close to the Sun, it would 
be very hot. As we move away from the Sun, planets should get 
colder. Is this what you found in Table 13.2? This is generally 
correct, except that Venus, the second planet from the Sun has 
the highest average temperature and is the hottest planet. Why is 
this so? 
Venus is the hottest planet not because it is the closest 
to the Sun, but because its thick atmosphere traps heat. 
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
The air on Venus is almost entirely made up of carbon 
dioxide gas, which does not let the heat escape. This 
is called the greenhouse effect (Fig. 13.2), and it 
makes Venus even hotter than Mercury, which is 
relatively closer to the Sun. On the Earth also, gases 
like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat 
by absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, 
after it gets warmed by the Sun. Thus, greenhouse 
effect plays an important role in maintaining just 
the right temperature on Earth.
A step further
The greenhouse effect that causes 
a planet like Venus and Earth to 
trap heat does not work the same 
way as a greenhouse for growing 
plants in a cool climate. On Venus 
or Earth, gases like carbon dioxide 
in the atmosphere trap heat by 
absorbing the radiation given off 
by the Earth, after it gets warmed 
by the Sun. A plant greenhouse, on 
the other hand, traps warmed air 
simply because it is a closed space, usually with glass walls (Fig. 13.3). 
It heats up during the day, but the air stays in and the heat does not 
escape easily. So while both keep things warm, they do it differently!
Fig. 13.3: Greenhouse for plants
13.3 What Makes the Earth Suitable for Life to 	
          Exist ?
13.3.1 Position of the Earth
The most important reason why the Earth 
can support life is its distance from the 
Sun. It is just at the right distance, where 
the temperature allows water to exist in a 
liquid form. If the Earth were closer to the 
Sun, it would be too hot and all the water 
would evaporate; if it were farther away, 
it would be too cold, and all the water 
would freeze.  In such extreme conditions, 
it would have been impossible for most 
life forms — especially plants, animals, and 
humans — to grow and thrive on Earth. 
Although some microbes, like certain

effect on Earth
Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet
bacteria, can survive in frozen environments, from 
what we know so far, liquid water is essential for 
life to evolve. Earth’s distance from the Sun allows 
water to remain mostly in liquid form, which is 
essential for the development and sustenance of life 
in all its form. The range of distances from the Sun 
(or another star) over which water remains liquid is 
called the habitable zone, or sometimes also called 
the ‘Goldilocks zone’ (Fig. 13.4).
As you have also studied in Social Science, most of 
Earth’s surface is covered with water. Thus, when seen 
from space, the Earth looks blue because of the vast 
amount of water—hence the name Blue Planet (Fig. 13.5).
Did Mars ever support life?
Mars lies at the edge of the Sun’s habitable zone. Several spacecrafts 
have been sent to Mars, rovers have landed and explored its surface, 
but no proof of life has been found yet. However, scientists think 
that in the past, Mars may have had 
liquid water — maybe even some 
lakes — and conditions that could 
support simple life forms (Fig. 13.6). 
This is one reason Mars continues 
to interest scientists. It also reminds 
us that science doesn’t always have 
final answers. As we explore more, 
we may find new clues—or even 
new kinds of life. Science stays open 
to change when we learn more.
Fig. 13.6: Mars
A step further
Is the temperature or distance from the Sun, the 
only factor that makes the Earth habitable?
What would happen if the size of the Earth 
were too small or too big?
 Fig. 13.5: Earth — The blue planet
13.3.2 Size of the Earth
There are some other important factors that make the Earth 
habitable. In our solar system, the orbits of most planets, 
including the Earth are almost circular. This keeps the amount of 
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
sunlight and heat nearly steady throughout the year, preventing 
extreme summers and winters at most places. 
However, moderate temperature due to the right distance 
from the Sun isn’t the only factor that makes the Earth habitable. 
The planet is also the right size to support an atmosphere. As you 
learnt earlier, the atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds 
the Earth, and it plays a major role in sustaining life. You also 
learnt in Chapter 5 that the Earth’s gravity pulls objects towards it. 
If Earth were much smaller (but with the same average density), 
its gravity would have been too weak to hold on to the gases in 
our atmosphere, and they would have escaped into space. On 
Mars, the atmosphere is 100 times thinner than on Earth, and 
Mercury has no atmosphere at all.
On the other hand, if the planet was too large, and gravity was 
much stronger, it would perhaps pull us down to the planet with 
such a large force that our bones could get crushed! Due to the 
right size of the Earth, it is able to support atmosphere which is 
essential for life.
The presence of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere allows us 
to breathe, and is needed by almost all forms of life on Earth. 
But oxygen has another important role. Some of the oxygen in 
our atmosphere, gets converted to another form called ozone 
(a  three-atom oxygen molecule), and forms an important part 
of the atmosphere called the ozone layer. This layer acts like a 
shield, blocking harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun that 
can damage living cells.
Our scientific heritage
India’s 
Mangalyaan 
(Mars 
Orbiter 
Mission), 
launched 
in 2013 by Indian Space 
Research Organisation (ISRO), 
was a big step in exploring 
Mars (Fig.  13.7). It carried 
tools to study the planet’s 
atmosphere, surface, and signs 
of past water. Some of these 
sensors help scientists ask 
big questions — like was Mars 
ever suitable for life? Mangalyaan showed the world that India could 
do space science with smart, low-cost technology — and it helped bring 
Mars closer to all of us.

Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet
13.3.3 Magnetic field of the Earth
In Curiosity, Grade 6, we learnt that 
a freely suspended magnet always 
settles in a fixed direction. This is 
because the Earth itself behaves 
like a giant magnet. You have also 
seen in Chapter 4 that the region around a magnet where its 
effect is felt has a magnetic field. It is believed that the movement 
of molten iron in Earth’s core may be the origin for Earth’s 
magnetic field. 
Earth is constantly hit by tiny, high-energy particles that 
come from space. Some come from far across the universe and 
are called cosmic rays. Other particles come from the Sun and 
are called the solar wind. These particles can be harmful as they 
can damage the atmosphere, reduce the ozone layer, and let in 
more harmful UV rays, which can affect life on Earth.
Thankfully, the Earth’s magnetic field acts like a protective 
shield. It pushes many of these harmful particles away from the 
Earth, keeping our atmosphere, and hence life on our planet safe.
Earth’s unique position in the solar system — allows the 
presence of liquid water — along with its size, atmosphere, and 
magnetic field, all help make it a planet where life can emerge 
and thrive.
But, how is life supported and 
sustained on Earth?
Does the magnetic field of 
the Earth have any role in 
sustaining life on Earth?
13.4 What Allows Life to Be Sustained on Earth?
Earth has the right conditions for life, but it is the beautiful 
connections between living and non-living things that help life to 
thrive. In Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, you learnt about key natural 
resources, such as, air, water, sunlight, soil, and minerals. 
You also learnt about the important life processes in plants and 
animals. Now, let us explore how all these elements interact to 
support and sustain life on Earth.
13.4.1 Air, water, and sunlight
We know that the atmosphere contains oxygen, which humans, 
animals, and plants use for respiration. In the presence of 
sunlight, plants take carbon dioxide from the air and water from 
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
the soil to prepare food by photosynthesis. In the process, oxygen is 
released, which is needed for respiration.
We have learnt, radiation from the Sun heats the Earth. Some of 
this heat is trapped by the atmosphere due to the greenhouse 
effect. This effect though mild, keeps the temperature just high 
enough for water to remain in the liquid state. In Curiosity, 
Grade 7, you also learnt about heat transfer by radiation. Without 
an atmosphere, the Earth would lose heat to space and become 
too cold. So the greenhouse effect helps keep the Earth warm.
Water is essential for life. You have learnt that it covers about 
70 per cent of the Earth’s surface and is found in ponds, lakes, 
rivers, springs, seas, oceans, and groundwater. 
All this water forms the hydrosphere. 
In Chapter 7, you learnt that water is a good 
solvent. In Curiosity, Grade 7, we learnt 
how water transports nutrients from soil to 
leaves in plants. In animals, it regulates body 
temperature, aids digestion, and ensures 
hydration, all essential for health and life.
Though much of Earth is covered by 
water, we still know little about what lives 
deep in the oceans. The hydrosphere is home 
to millions of life forms, from tiny planktons to giant whales, 
many still being discovered. Oceans, lakes, and rivers provide 
rich environments for aquatic life (Fig. 13.8). Freshwater is also 
needed to grow crops and support people around the world.
Water vapour in the air forms clouds and brings rain or snow. 
This refills rivers, lakes, and underground water. Rainfall affects 
the kinds of plants and animals that can live in a place. Moving 
air also shapes weather and rainfall — which influence farming, 
water supply, and life on land.
13.4.2 Soil, rocks, and minerals
Beneath our feet lies something remarkable — the Earth’s crust, 
made of rocks, soil, and minerals. It may seem hard and lifeless, 
but it provides almost everything life needs to grow and survive. 
From soil that helps plants grow to minerals that give us salt, coal, 
oil, and metals like iron and copper — this outer layer support 
both ecosystems and human life. The solid parts of the Earth, 
including materials like rocks, soils, and minerals are known as 
the geosphere.
Soil may look like simple dirt, but it is rich in nutrients like 
nitrogen and potassium that plants need to grow. These nutrients 
come from the slow breakdown of rocks and the remains of 
plants and animals.
 Fig. 13.8: Life in water
Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet
There are various types of landforms, 
rocks, soils, etc., on Earth. This variety along 
with the processes that shape and alter them 
is called geodiversity (Fig.  13.9). It helps 
create unique habitats where different 
types of life can thrive. The non-living parts 
of nature, like soil, rocks, and water, aren’t 
just a background — they help shape the 
story of life itself.
13.4.3 Plants, animals, and microorganisms
From the chapter on microbes to the chapter on ecology, we have 
seen that the Earth is full of life — from trees, shrubs, herbs, to 
animals, insects, and tiny organisms invisible to the naked eye. 
All living beings, along with the places where they live, make 
up the biosphere. This includes land, water, and air, where life 
interacts with its surroundings to survive and grow.
As you learnt in Chapter 12, living beings depend on one 
another and their environment. Plants make food through 
photosynthesis, animals eat plants or other animals, and 
decomposers break down dead matter and return nutrients to 
the soil. Nature works together as a system to support life.
13.4.4 The importance of balance
Have you ever wondered how so many things on Earth stay in 
balance? Earth is like a giant teamwork project between nature, 
weather, and life itself. It is a vast, living system where land, air, 
water, and living things support and affect one another. Even 
a small change in one part — like cutting down a forest — can 
impact rainfall, soil, air quality, and the animals that live there. 
Life on Earth survives not because of just one thing, but because 
everything works together in balance. It is this balance that 
keeps our planet habitable. That’s why preserving and protecting 
clean air, water, soil, and all forms of life isn’t just important but 
essential for keeping Earth healthy for the future.
13.5 What Keeps Life from Disappearing?
If plants and animals didn’t reproduce, life would eventually 
disappear from Earth. Reproduction ensures that each type of 
organism continues to exist, maintaining the continuity of life.
We usually expect that animals will produce young ones that 
resemble them — cows have calves, and cats have kittens. This 
happens because parents pass on instructions to their offspring 
about how to develop from a single cell. These instructions, 
 Fig. 13.9: Geodiversity
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
called genetic material or genes, are stored inside every cell of 
a living being. You can think of genes as a detailed instruction 
manual inside each cell. Some instructions tell the cell how to 
make blood, while others guide the formation of bones, muscles, 
or skin. Together, these instructions ensure that a calf grows into 
a cow, or a kitten grows into a cat.
But reproduction does more than just create more of the same kind 
of living beings. It also allows for small changes in the instructions 
that are passed down from parents to offpsrings. Sometimes, these 
changes help a plant or animal survive better in a new environment. 
For example, over time, camels developed humps to store fat and 
survive in deserts. Even microbes evolve — some bacteria, as you 
learnt in the chapter on health, have become resistant to antibiotics, 
helping them persist. Over many generations, such changes can lead 
to new features — or even completely new types of living beings. So, 
reproduction not only keeps each kind continuing, but also helps 
life adapt change, and continue in new forms (Fig. 13.10).
But how can the same process lead both to similarity (an animal 
gives birth to similar individual, such as a cow gives birth to a cow) 
and variation (shows different characteristics like difference in 
color and height of to individuals of 
some kind)? That is a fascinating puzzle. 
There are two types of reproductive 
processes — one in which the young 
are almost exactly like their parent 
and another in which they look slightly 
different from their parents.
In asexual reproduction, a single 
parent produces new individuals that 
are exact copies of itself (exact in terms of the instructions inside 
the cell). In sexual reproduction, instructions from two parents 
combine to create offspring that are not exactly like either of 
the parent. They share some traits with both parents, but also 
have differences. This mixing helps keep useful features while 
allowing new ones to appear. Over many generations, these 
small differences can add up — leading to big differences, and 
even new life forms.
Let’s explore how reproduction takes place in plants and 
animals, and how it helps living beings develop special features 
and sometimes change over time. 
13.5.1 Asexual reproduction
Many plants can reproduces when any part of the plants — leaf, 
stem, or root — is planted in soil. This kind of reproduction is 
called vegetative propagation. 
Fig. 13.10: Development of calf to cow
Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet
Can you observe and list some 
plants around you that grow this 
way?
Activity 13.3: Let us find out
	
z Take some parts of plants like stem cutting of a money plant, 
the ‘eyes’ of a sprouted potato, or a piece of ginger (Fig. 13.11b).
	
z Plant each of them separately in moist soil (not too deep). For 
money plant, you can just put a cutting in a glass container 
which makes it easy to observe.
	
z Make sure they get all the conditions they need to grow—like 
water, air, and sunlight.
	
z Watch them every day and note how many days it takes for 
roots stem and leaves to appear. Also observe when the first 
new leaf appears.
Ever heard of ...
Not just plants – microbes and simple animals also reproduce 
asexually. For example, single-celled organisms like bacteria and 
amoebae divide into two identical individuals. Some multicellular 
organisms like algae can regrow from small cut parts. 
Hydra, another simple animal, grows tiny buds on its 
body that break off and grow into new individuals.
Planaria, a type of flatworm, can regrow from just 
a small piece of their body! Scientists study them to 
understand regeneration in animals.

Planaria (Fig. 13.12), a type of flatworm, can 
regrow from a fragment of its body! Scientists study 
this organism to understand regeneration in animals.
Fig. 13.12: Planaria
13.5.2 Sexual reproduction 
In this type of reproduction, two parents are involved — usually 
called male and female. This is easy to observe in animals, but 
did you know even flowering plants have male and female parts? 
Some microorganisms like bacteria and yeast also have two 
‘mating types’ that act like the two parents.
Special cells for reproduction
You might wonder if both parents pass on their genetic material 
for making a new organism, won’t the child end up with double 
the amount of instructions? And would not this keep doubling 
every generation?
This does not happen because each parent makes specialised 
reproductive cells, called gametes. These carry only half of the 
parent’s genetic material . When male and female gametes join, 
they form a new cell with a complete set of instructions — half 
from each parent.
How do bamboo and sugarcane 
grow into new plants? I have 
never seen their seeds.
Fig. 13.11: Vegetative 
propagation — (a) 
Ginger; (b) Potato
(b) 
(a) 
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Babies do not look exactly like their mother or father. Even 
brothers and sisters in the same family can look different from 
each other. This is because every baby gets a mix of genetic 
information from both parents through gametes. Each gamete 
carries a different set of instructions for things like eye colour, hair 
type, and more. These instructions mix in different ways when 
the sperm and eggs joins to form a baby. These instructions mix 
in different ways each time, so each child is unique. No wonder 
one child may ‘inherit’ a nose similar to mother and another may 
inherit eyes similar to father. It all depends on which pieces of 
the parent’s ‘instruction book set’ came together.
Sexual reproduction in plants
Plants use different parts of their flowers to produce 
male and female gametes. Pollen grains found inside the 
anther of a flower are the male gametes, while ovules, 
found deep inside the flower, are the female gametes. 
Pollen is carried to another flower by wind, insects, or 
animals — this process is called pollination. When the 
male and female gametes combine, it is called fertilisation, 
forming a zygote that becomes the seed. The fleshy part of the 
flower around the ovule develops into a fruit (Fig. 13.13).
When birds or animals eat the fruit, the seeds often get 
dropped far from the original plant — a helpful way for plants 
to spread. That’s how a banyan seed, dropped by a bird that ate 
a fruit and excreted the seed, might sprout in a crack in a wall 
after the rains. When seeds get water, they use stored nutrients 
to grow roots and shoots. Remember in Grade 6 you had studied 
the germination of seeds where you observed tiny shoots and the 
first leaves appear.
Sexual reproduction in animals
In animals, gametes are called sperm (male) and eggs 
(female). Fertilisation may take place in water, for example, 
male and female fish or frogs eject sperm and eggs, 
respectively, into the water where they combine to form 
the zygote. In these animals, the development of the zygote 
into an embryo also takes place in water (Fig. 13.14).
In birds and mammals, including humans, sperm 
are deposited inside the female and fertilisation takes 
place when the sperm swim towards the egg produced 
by the female. After this step, birds and mammals follow 
different processes.

Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet
In birds, the fertilised egg (zygote) is ‘laid’ by the female. 
The development of the zygote into an embryo happens after the 
egg is laid during the hatching process. Think about how much 
‘food’ the female parent has to put into each egg — it has to last 
for the developing embryo until it hatches. This is one strategy to 
ensures supply of nutrition to the embryo.
In most mammals, the development of the zygote into an 
embryo takes place inside the body of the female. The mother’s 
body provides all the food and oxygen the baby needs to grow 
until it is born. This is a different way of giving nutrition to the 
developing baby, compared to animals like birds that lay eggs. 
What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving birth to 
young ones vs. laying eggs? Do you think animals like dogs, cows, 
or humans could lay eggs like birds? Why or why not?
13.6 What Are the Threats to Life on Earth?
We know that life on Earth depends on a delicate balance of 
living and non-living things working together. But human 
actions are disturbing this balance. Even small changes in 
global temperature, oxygen levels, or the ozone layer can put 
life at risk.
Today, the biggest environmental challenges that we face 
are climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution — together 
known as the triple planetary crisis.
Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil releases greenhouse gases 
like carbon dioxide and methane. These trap even more heat in 
the atmosphere which causes global warming. Normally, Earth 
keeps a balance since trees, plants, and even tiny ocean planktons 
absorb carbon dioxide as they grow. But when we burn fossil 
fuels, we release extra carbon that has been locked underground 
for millions of years. The Earth cannot absorb this fast enough, so 
the heat builds up. Even a small increase in temperature can melt 
ice caps, raise sea levels which could flood many coastal cities, 
cause extreme weather conditions, and lead to many plants and 
animals disappearing. These long-term changes in temperature, 
rainfall, and weather patterns are called climate change. 
When natural habitats are destroyed, plants and animals 
may disappear, upsetting ecosystems. For example, as we saw in 
Chapter 12, if grasses vanish, animals that feed on them like deer 
or grasshoppers struggle to survive. And without herbivores, 
predators like tigers or foxes lose their food too. Every type of 
living thing has a role, and losing even a few weakens nature’s 
ability to support life.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Pollution adds to the problem. Air pollution 
from factories, vehicles, and burning fuels 
harms both people and the nature. It can 
cause breathing problems, damage crops, 
and lead to smog and acid rain (Fig. 13.15).
Climate change affects everything—from 
crop growth and water supply to wildlife 
habitats and human health. To protect life on 
Earth, we need to cut pollution, use cleaner 
energy, and make wiser choices. We have 
also learnt that life on Earth flourishes within 
a delicate balance supported by interdependent natural systems. 
However, this balance is increasingly threatened by human 
actions. For example, a little less or more of oxygen in air, or a 
little lower or higher temperature of the Earth, or a little less of 
ozone in the atmosphere, could endanger life on the Earth.
Countries around the world have made global agreements to protect 
the environment. The Montreal Protocol (1987) helped reduce 
harmful chemicals like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), allowing the 
ozone layer to slowly recover. The Earth Summit (1992) led to 
international efforts on climate change and biodiversity. Later, 
the Kyoto Protocol (2005) and Paris Agreement (2015) committed 
countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement 
set a goal to limit global warming to below 1.5 °C, but as of 2025, the 
world is not on track to meet that goal. Much more action is needed 
to avoid any more adverse effects of climate change.
Ever heard of ...
Water and soil pollution are serious threats to life 
(Fig.  13.16). Factory, farm and plastic waste harm aquatic 
life and make water unsafe. Excess fertilisers and poor waste 
disposal pollute soil, reduce crop yield, and spread harmful 
substances through the food chain. Protecting them requires 
better waste management and sustainable 
farming practices.
We have seen above that all the Earth system, 
such as hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere and 
geosphere are connected — so damage to one can 
affect the others. Protecting the climate means 
cutting down on greenhouse gases by using 
renewable energy like solar and wind, improving 
energy use, and choosing environmentally friendly 
ways to travel. At the same time, preserving

biodiversity is key as diverse ecosystems are stronger and more 
balanced. Local communities can play a big role in using natural 
resources sustainably.
Everyone can help. Reusing, repairing, and recycling items 
like clothes and plastic reduce pollution and waste. Small actions 
like saving energy and water add up. Learning more, sharing 
ideas, and encouraging others also makes a difference.
In conclusion, sustaining life on Earth needs action from all 
of us — from local communities to global leaders. By working 
together and living responsibly, we can protect this unique 
planet and its future.
Snapshots
	

Our Earth is a unique planet in the solar system as it supports life. 
	

Earth orbits the Sun at a distance where the temperature is 
neither too hot nor too cold, which allows water to exist in liquid 
form. This region is called the habitable zone or Goldilocks zone.
	

Further, the Earth orbits the Sun in a nearly circular orbit ensuring 
that the Earth is not too hot or too cold during any part of the year.
	

The Earth’s gravity is just enough to not let atmosphere escape 
into space. It is also not too high where creatures would be 
crushed by their own weight.
	

Presence of ozone in the atmosphere prevents harmful ultraviolet 
rays from reaching the surface of the Earth.
	

The magnetic field of the Earth shields it from high-energy 
particles that would otherwise hit the Earth and destroy life. 
	

The atmosphere (consisting of air), hydrosphere (consisting of 
water), geosphere (consisting of the solid part of the Earth), and 
biosphere (consisting of life) interact and together sustain life on 
the Earth.
	

Reproduction is essential to ensure the continuity of life on Earth.
	

Reproduction can be either asexual or sexual.
	

In asexual reproduction, a single parent produces new individuals 
that are exact copies of itself.
	

Sexual reproduction make it possible for new features to appear 
in the following generation.
	

In different animals, the development of the zygote into an 
embryo takes place either inside or outside the body.
	

Climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution are threatening 
life on Earth. Together, these challenges are known as the triple 
planetary crisis.

Keep the curiosity alive
1.	 What is one major reason Mars cannot currently support life 
like Earth?
(i)	 It has too many volcanoes.
(ii)	 It is too close to the Sun.
(iii)	 It lacks a thick atmosphere and liquid water.
(iv)	 Its magnetic field is too strong.
2.	 Which of these is an example of geodiversity?
(i)	 Variety of bird chirping in a forest.
(ii)	 Different landforms like mountains, valleys, and deserts.
(iii)	 Changing weather during monsoons.
(iv)	 Number of different types of fish in a pond.
3.	 If the Earth were smaller with the same density, what might 
happen to its atmosphere?
(i)	 It would become thicker and hotter.
(ii)	 It would escape into space due to weaker gravity.
(iii)	 It would become frozen.
(iv)	 It would cause stronger winds.
4.	 In sexual reproduction, why are offspring different from 
their parents?
(i)	 They grow in different climates.
(ii)	 They eat different food.
(iii)	 They acquire new instructions after birth.
(iv)	 They get mixed instructions (genes) from both parents.
5.	 You notice tiny green plants growing in cracks on your school 
wall after the monsoon. Where do you think the seeds came 
from? What conditions helped these plants grow there?
6.	 A city has recently cut down a large patch of forest to build 
new roads and buildings. Discuss the possible effects this 
could have on the local climate and biodiversity? How might 
this affect water availability or quality in the area?
7.	 A friend says, “The Earth has always had climate changes 
in the past, so today’s global warming is nothing new.” How 
would you respond using what you’ve learnt in this and 
other chapters of your science book?
Why?
When?
How long?
Where?
Why not?

8.	 Imagine Earth’s magnetic field suddenly disappeared. What 
kinds of problems could arise for life on Earth? Explain.
9.	 You are tasked with designing a new settlement for humans 
on Mars. Name three things you would need to recreate from 
Earth to support human life there. Which of these do you 
think is the hardest to replicate, and why?
10.	 In a village, the temperature has been increasing and rainfall 
has become unpredictable over the past few years. What 
could be causing this change? Suggest two ways the village 
could adapt to these new conditions.
11.	 If there were no atmosphere on the Earth, would it affect 
life, temperature, and water on the planet? Explain.
12.	 Discuss five examples of vegetative propagation.

z Design an ‘Earth Survival Kit’. Imagine you’re building a 
tiny model of Earth for another planet. What must it have to 
support life, and why?
	
z India is planning for a challenging lunar mission, 
Chandrayaan-4, which will bring back samples of soil from 
the Moon. If the Moon had water, could plants grow in that 
soil? Think of some experiment that could help you explore 
whether plant growth is possible on the Moon.  
	
z Flowers are often brightly coloured and have a pleasant smell. 
How do you think these features help the plant reproduce?
	
z Why do animals like fish and frogs lay hundreds or even 
thousands of eggs at a time, while other animals lay only a 
few? What might be the advantages and disadvantages of 
laying so many eggs?
	
z Birds like sparrows build nests and care for their eggs and 
chicks, while reptiles like snakes usually lay their eggs and 
leave them without protection. How might this difference in 
parental care affect the chances of survival for the young 
ones in each case?

It's never the end, my friend!
And we have arrived at the final page of our Grade 8 science journey. 
But remember, this is not the end of your exploration. Throughtout the year, 
we hope you have learnt to ask deeper questions, design investigations, and 
think like real scientists do. Whether you wondered about how forces work, 
explored the remarkable balance of our planet, or investigated how ecosystems 
are connected, you’ve already entered the Investigative World of Science.
If you noticed, we left space in every chapter for you to ask your own questions. 
What are the things around you that puzzled you? Perhaps you noticed how 
water droplets on a leaf act like a lens, or wondered why different birds have 
different flight patterns. Things that you notice, and the questions you ask about 
them are the very beginning of scientific investigation. This textbook has been 
designed to guide you — rooted in real observations, yet lifting your imagination 
to fly as high as a kite. But the real adventure belongs to you: keep asking, keep 
experimenting, keep sharing your findings with your friends and teachers.
As you close this book, remember that next year, you will enter the secondary 
stage, where we will go deeper into the world of science. The story will continue 
with more detailed investigations, bigger challenges, and greater discoveries. 
So never stop wondering, never stop experimenting, and never stop believing 
that your curiosity can change the world. We’ll meet you again on those pages 
— because in science, it is never the end, my friend!
