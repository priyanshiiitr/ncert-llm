Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter
You might have collected pebbles and stones from the sand while 
playing on a riverbank or a beach. Where do these pebbles, 
stones, and sand come from? 
In the mountains, rocks gradually break down due to erosion. 
Rivers flowing through these regions carry along the eroded rock 
pieces. As the rivers flow, they continue to break down the rocks 
further into pebbles, stones, sand; and transport large quantities 
of them to the plains.
The bigger rocks are eventually broken down into finer grains 
of sand and clay. Is this grain the smallest unit of a bigger rock 
or can these grains of sand and clay be broken down further? 
Let us find out!
7.1 What Is Matter Composed of?
 
Activity 7.1: Let us explore
	
z Take a stick of chalk (Fig. 7.1a) and break it into two 
pieces (Fig. 7.1b). 
	
z Continue breaking the chalk till it becomes difficult 
to break it further by hand.
	
z Grind the small pieces of chalk thus obtained 
(Fig. 7.1c) using mortar and pestle.
	
z Observe the fine powder of chalk with a magnifying 
glass (Fig. 7.1d).
	
z What do you observe?
	
z Each tiny grain you observe is still a speck of chalk.     
Is every speck of this fine 
chalk powder still composed 
of 
the 
same 
substance, 
or has it changed into 
something else on breaking 
or grinding?
Recall Curiosity, Grade 7 chapter ‘Changes Around 
Us: Physical and Chemical’— is grinding chalk a physical 
change or a chemical change? You learnt that the chalk 
does not change into a new substance on grinding. It is a 
physical change in which only the size of each speck of 
chalk has reduced further.

Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
These specks of chalk powder can be broken further into 
smaller particles by further grinding. Let us imagine that this 
process of grinding continues. Eventually, we would reach a stage 
where the chalk particles cannot be broken down any further. 
The tiny units obtained at this stage 
are the basic building blocks that the 
chalk was made up of. 
This means that one whole piece of 
chalk was made up of a large number 
of smaller units. These units are called 
constituent particles of chalk. A constituent particle is the basic 
unit that makes up a larger piece of a substance or material. Just 
like chalk, the grains of sand and clay are not the smallest units 
of bigger rocks. These are also made up of a large number of 
their constituent particles.
Let us explore further!
Recall the dissolution of sugar into water to form a solution. 
What happens to sugar when it is dissolved in water?
Activity 7.2: Let us perform
	
z Fill a glass tumbler with 
drinking water. 
	
z Put two teaspoons of sugar 
into it.
	
z Do not stir the water. Taste a 
small spoonful of water from 
the top layer of the glass.
Does the water taste sweet? 
	
z Now, stir the water until the sugar dissolves completely 
(Fig. 7.2). 
	
z Again taste a spoonful of water from the top layer.
What difference in taste do you notice? Does it taste sweet? 
Since the top layer of water tastes sweet after dissolving 
sugar, it must be present in the solution. Do you observe any 
sugar particles in the solution? 
Sugar particles can no longer be observed but their 
presence can be sensed by taste. When sugar dissolves in 
water, it breaks up into its constituent particles which cannot 
be broken down further. Each tiny grain of sugar is made up 
of millions and millions of such constituent particles.
Are the units of chalk 
obtained in this manner 
considered the smallest 
units of chalk?

sugar in water

Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter
Activities 7.1 and 7.2 support the idea that matter is composed 
of a large number of extremely small particles. These particles 
are so small that they cannot be seen even through an ordinary 
microscope.
But, where did 
the sugar go?
The tiny sugar particles separate and occupy the available 
spaces between the water particles. These spaces between the 
particles are known as interparticle spaces. 
Chalk and sugar can both 
be broken down into their 
constituent particles. But how 
are the constituent particles 
held together to form the solid 
pieces we see?
7.2 What Decides Different States of Matter?
The constituent particles of matter are held together through 
forces which are attractive in nature. These forces are called 
interparticle attractions. The strength of these attractions 
depends on the nature of the substance and the interparticle 
distance. Even a slight increase in the distance decreases the 
interparticle forces drastically. The strength of these forces 
ultimately decides the physical state of the substances.
Do you know that since ancient times, people have been thinking 
about how far things could be broken down and what is matter 
made up of?
	
Acharya Kanad, an ancient Indian philosopher, first spoke 
about the idea of a Parmanu (atom). He believed that matter is 
made up of tiny, indivisible eternal particles called Parmanu. 
This idea was written in his work called Vaisheshika Sutras. 
Our scientific heritage
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Let us explore how these attractions vary in different states.
7.2.1 Solid state
How are constituent particles held together in solids?
Activity 7.3 : Let us find out
	
z Collect a few solid objects, such as a piece 
of iron or an iron nail, a piece of rock salt, 
a stone, a piece of wood, a key, and a piece 
of aluminium (Fig. 7.3). 
	
z Observe their shapes and sizes.
	
z Try hammering them.
	
z In which of the above six objects do 
you  think particles are strongly held 
together?
You must have noticed that all these 
objects are solids. They have a definite shape 
and volume. This is due to the fact that in solids, the particles 
are tightly packed and the interparticle attractions are very 
strong. These strong forces of attraction hold the particles in 
fixed positions, preventing them from moving freely (Fig. 7.4a). 
The particles can only move to and fro about their 
positions (vibrate or oscillate) but cannot move 
past each other.
When solids are heated, their particles vibrate 
more vigorously (Fig. 7.4b). A stage is reached 
when these vibrations become so vigorous that the 
particles start leaving their position. The interparticle forces of 
attraction get weakened and the solid gets converted into the 
liquid state (Fig. 7.4c). The temperature at which this happens is 
the melting point of the solid.

In the solid state, 
is there any way 
to 
move 
these 
particles apart? 
Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter
The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become 
a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. 
Generally, in a liquid state, particles are somewhat farther away 
from each other as compared to those in the solid state (ice is an 
exception—its particles are farther apart than those in water). 
Some solids have weak interparticle forces of attraction, so 
their melting points are low. While others have strong attractive 
forces and have high melting points. Some examples of solids 
and their melting points are shown in Table 7.1.

7.2.2 Liquid state
Activity 7.4: Let us try and find out
Fig. 7.5: Water placed in containers of different shapes
(a)
A
200 mL
(b)
B
200 mL
(c)
C
200 mL
	
z Take three clean and dry containers of different shapes. 
Label them A, B, and C (Fig. 7.5). 
	
z Mark the 200 mL level in each container using a marker or 
by pasting a thin strip of paper. 
	
z Fill Container A with water up to the marked level.
	
z Carefully transfer the water from Container A to Container  B 
without spilling, and observe the shape and level of the 
water.
	
z Now, transfer the same water from Container B to Container C, 
carefully, and observe the shape and its level again. 
You will notice that the water takes the shape of the container 
into which it is poured. So, we can say that the liquids do not 
have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are 
kept in. This happens because the particles of liquids are free to 
move. In all three containers, the water level remains at 200 mL 
and no change in volume is observed. Hence, we can say that 
liquids have a definite volume. However, if a container is not 
clean, some water may stick to its walls, causing the water level 
in the next container to be slightly less than 200 mL after pouring.
Activity 7.4 shows that the particles of liquids can 
move freely, but only within a limited space. Therefore, 
we can infer that liquids have no fixed shape but have 
a fixed volume.
Let us now compare interparticle forces of 
attraction in liquids and solids. Take some water in a 
shallow vessel and try to move your finger through it 
(Fig. 7.6).
Are you able to move your finger through the water?
Fig. 7.6: Moving finger through water
Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter
You can move your finger through water without breaking 
or cutting it permanently, which cannot be done in the case of 
solids. When you try this, you are temporarily displacing water. 
As soon as you remove your finger, the position of the water is 
restored. We can say that in liquids, the interparticle attractions 
are slightly weaker than in solids, but still strong enough to keep 
the particles close together. 
Recall Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Temperature and Its 
Measurement’, where you observed the temperature of boiling 
water (liquid). When a liquid is heated, a stage comes when 
it starts boiling. The temperature at which a liquid boils and 
turns into vapour at atmospheric pressure is called its boiling 
point. The movement of particles becomes so vigorous that they 
move apart from each other, resulting 
in a decrease in the interparticle forces 
of attraction. Eventually, the constituent 
particles can escape from the liquid state. 
The liquid is converted into vapour or the 
gaseous state.
At the boiling point, the formation of vapour is very fast and 
occurs not only at the surface but also within the liquid. This 
process is observed as bubble formation in the liquid. However, 
vapour formation occurs at all temperatures, even below the 
boiling point, though slowly and only at the surface. This slower 
process is known as evaporation — about which you have learnt 
in  earlier grades.
7.2.3 Gaseous state
Do gases also have 
a fixed volume?
Activity 7.5: Let us investigate
	
z Take two transparent gas jars or glass tumblers 
and mark them A and B. 
	
z Create some smoke by burning an incense stick. 
	
z Hold the Gas Jar A upside down over the smoke (Fig. 7.7a). 
	
z The gas jar should trap the smoke inside.
	
z Turn it over and cover it with a glass plate (Fig. 7.7b).
	
z Hold another Gas Jar B upside down and gently place it over 
the glass plate covering the Gas Jar A.
I have seen that spilled 
water disappears after 
some time, and it happens 
at any temperature!
Safety first
Be careful while burning 
an incense stick.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
	
z Remove the glass plate slowly 
and ensure that both gas jars 
are close enough and there is 
no gap for smoke to escape 
(Fig. 7.7c).
	
z Observe how the smoke 
spreads inside the Gas Jar B. 
	
z The smoke fills the entire 
space in the Gas Jar B, 
indicating that gases do not 
have a fixed volume and tend 
to occupy the entire available 
space (Fig. 7.7d). Like liquids, 
they also acquire the shape 
of the vessel they are in.
This 
illustrates 
that 
the 
particles in gases move freely in 
all directions and the interparticle 
attractions are negligible. As a 
result, gases do not have a fixed 
shape or volume.
In this activity, smoke is used to 
represent the gaseous state. The tiny particles of smoke suspended 
in the air are constantly hit by invisible particles of gases, and their 
movement helps us observe the motion of gas particles. 
This activity can also be demonstrated by using iodine vapour 
instead of smoke from incense sticks. 
Iodine vapour can be obtained by 
placing some solid iodine in a closed gas 
jar for some time, as shown in Fig. 7.8. 
Both liquids and gases flow and 
do not retain a fixed shape. These 
properties distinguish them from 
solids and classify them as fluids.

7.3 How Does the Interparticle Spacing 
Differ in the Three States of Matter? 
What role does the interparticle spacing play in determining the 
properties of each state (solid, liquid, and gas)?
Let us perform the following activities to find answers to 
these questions.
Activity 7.6: Let us experiment
	
z Take a syringe without a needle. Pull the plunger of the 
syringe outwards in a fully extended position (Fig. 7.9a).
	
z Place your thumb over the open end of the syringe to prevent 
the air present inside the syringe from escaping (Fig. 7.9b). 
	
z Push the plunger slowly and steadily inward (Fig. 7.9c).

plunger outwards
(b) Placing thumb 
over the open end
(c) Pushing the 
plunger inwards
Syringe 
without a 
needle
	
z What do you observe?
As you do this, you will notice that the volume of air inside the 
syringe decreases.
What can we say about the behaviour of gas in the syringe? 
When you compress the air by pushing the plunger, the 
particles are forced to come closer. This shows that the gas 
particles have a lot of space between them in their natural state, 
and this space can be reduced by applying external pressure.
If you stop pushing the plunger, the gas particles spread, and 
the plunger moves back to its original position.
Repeat this activity using water and observe.
You would observe that water is practically incompressible.
Let us perform another activity to learn about the interparticle 
spaces in liquids.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Activity 7.7: Let us observe
	
z Take a glass vessel, fill it about half with water, and mark the 
level of water A (Fig. 7.10a).
	
z Add two teaspoons of sugar into it. 
	
z Mark the new water level on the glass vessel B  (Fig. 7.10b). 
	
z Stir the water with a glass rod to dissolve the sugar (Fig. 7.10c). 
	
z Predict whether the water level will increase or decrease 
with respect to the mark B. 
	
z Mark this water level again as C (Fig. 7.10d).

Dissolving 
Sugar  
in water
What difference do you observe in the water levels?
You will observe that initially, when sugar is added, the level 
of water increases, but after dissolution, it may decrease to some 
extent. Since the volume of the solution is less than the sum of 
the volumes of water and sugar, it indicates that 
there is some space between the water particles. 
The particles of the dissolved substance occupy 
these spaces (Fig. 7.11). 
Repeat the Activity 7.7 with some other soluble 
solids, such as common salt or glucose, and 
insoluble solids, like sand and stone pieces.
What do you observe in each case? Do the sand 
particles dissolve? Does the volume of water in 
the vessel change after mixing, and why?
Sugar and sand are both 
solids. Why does sugar 
dissolve in water but sand 
does not?

picture of distribution of sugar

Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter
Sand is a solid that does not dissolve 
in water. When added to water, the sand 
particles settle down and occupy some 
space in the container, causing the total 
volume to increase.
What do you think about the interparticle 
spacing in solids?
You learnt earlier that the constituent 
particles in solids are held together by strong 
forces of attraction. So, these particles do 
not move from one place to another and 
are closely packed. However, despite close 
packing, some space is left between the 
particles as shown in Fig. 7.12a. You might 
assume that the space between particles is 
filled with air, but this is not the case. They 
contain nothing at all. Fig. 7.12 summarises 
the packing of particles and the interparticle 
spacing in the three states of matter.
A step further
Often, we use the term ‘particle’ in different contexts. The meaning 
of this term changes with the context. For example, while talking 
about air pollution, the term Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) 
is used. This term refers to the tiny dust particles suspended in air 
and not the constituent particles of matter which are extremely 
small as compared to the dust particles. In fact, even these tiny dust 
particles are also made up of a very large number of constituent 
particles, i.e, atoms and molecules. 
7.4 How Particles Move in Different States 
of Matter?
Let us find out about the movement of particles in the three states 
of matter.
Activity 7.8: Let us experiment 
	
z Take a glass tumbler containing 
water and put a few grains of 
potassium permanganate into it.
	
z What do you observe?

interparticle spacing in the three states 
of matter

(b) Liquid
(c) Gas
Safety first
Do not touch potassium permanganate 
with your hands. Use a spoon or a spatula 
to handle it.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
	
z Initially, you will see some streaks of 
pink colour spreading out from the grain 
(Fig. 7.13a). 
	
z With the passage of time, the entire bulk of 
water will acquire a uniform pink colour 
(Fig. 7.13b).
	
z Do you know why this happens?
This happens because the water particles 
are in constant motion. First they pull out the 
particles of potassium permanganate from its 
grain, and later they hit these particles so that 
they get spread throughout the liquid. In the case 
of many substances, the constituent particles 
are held together strongly that the water particles are unable to 
pull these out. Such substances, like sand, are insoluble in water.
Think like a scientist
Try it yourself!
	

Take three clean glass tumblers.
	

Pour hot water in one of them, water at room temperature in the 
second and ice-cold water in the third.
	

Drop a small grain of potassium permanganate into each of them. 
	

Watch carefully and compare. What do you observe?
Water particles move faster in hot water compared to water at 
room temperature, and even slower in ice-cold water. As a result, 
the potassium permanganate spreads the fastest in hot water, less 
quickly in water at room temperature, and the slowest in ice-cold 
water. Hence, the movement of particles increases when heat is 
provided.
Try to depict it by drawing a diagram.

Fig. 7.14: Burning of an incense stick
When an incense stick is burnt in one corner of the room, 
initially, the fragrance is felt only around the incense stick. Shortly, 
you can smell the fragrance throughout the room. This happens 
because the particles of the fragrance spread, filling the entire 
room. This shows that the particles of air are moving constantly. 
The air particles hit the particles of the fragrance and help them 
spread throughout the room.
Oh! 
Now 
I 
know 
why 
and how the fragrance of 
perfume reaches us.
Can you share a few other real-life situations where you have 
experienced the movement of gas particles?
Ever heard of ...
The particulate nature of matter 
plays a crucial role in many 
everyday processes. For example, 
when we wash clothes stained 
with oil using soap, numerous 
soap particles surround the oil 
particles on the fabric. One end 
of the soap particle attaches to 
the oil, and the other mixes with 
water, thus helping lift the oil off 
and wash it away (Fig. 7.15).
Fig. 7.15: Particles of soap 
help in cleaning
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Based on our learnings from the chapter, we can say that matter 
is made up of small particles which are held together by the force 
of attraction. The strength of attractive forces between particles 
depends on the distance between them, which in turn depends 
on their thermal (heat) energy. Thus, it is the thermal energy of 
the particles that determines the physical state of matter. In the 
solid state, the thermal energy of particles is low, so they remain 
close to each other and experience strong interparticle attractive 
forces. This restricts their motion to only small vibrations.
At the melting point, the thermal energy is used to overcome 
the attractive forces between particles, allowing the solid to 
change into a liquid. At this stage, the particles can move away 
from their fixed positions. The interparticle distance increases 
slightly, reducing the strength of the attractive forces to a level 
that allows the particles to move around, though still within a 
limited space. In the gaseous state, the particles have enough 
energy to overcome the forces of attraction between them and 
move freely in all directions. You will learn more about these 
particles that constitute matter in higher grades.

Snapshots  
	

Matter is composed of extremely small particles.
	

The particles are held together by interparticle forces of attractions.
	

The interparticle attractions are the strongest in solids, a little weaker 
in liquids, and the weakest in gases.
	

Solids have a fixed shape and size due to strong interparticle attraction, 
minimum interparticle space, and no free movement of the constituent 
particles.
	

The interparticle attraction in liquids is slightly weaker than in solids, 
enabling the particles to move within a particular space and providing 
them with a little more interparticle spacing. Therefore, liquids have a 
definite volume but no fixed shape.
	

The interparticle attractions in gases are negligible, making their 
particles completely free to move from one place to another and 
resulting in maximum interparticle space. Therefore, gases have no 
fixed shape and volume.

different temperatures—create and perform a role-play/
dance showing particles in motion.
	
z Debate in the class — ‘Gases can spread and fill all the available 
space’. Is this property of gases beneficial or harmful?
A step further
The tiny particles that make up all matter are atoms and molecules. 
For example, iron is made up of atoms of iron, and gold is made up 
of atoms of gold. Atoms of many elements like hydrogen, oxygen, 
and sulfur are not able to exist independently. In such cases, a 
certain number of atoms of the same element combine to form a 
molecule. For example, two atoms of hydrogen combine and form 
a stable particle called a molecule of hydrogen. A water molecule 
is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. You will 
learn about atoms and molecules in higher grades.
