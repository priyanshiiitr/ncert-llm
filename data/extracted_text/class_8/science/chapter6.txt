Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones
You must have observed fallen leaves on the ground swirling 
in the air or being swept away, and trees swaying or even 
bending when a strong wind blows. Have you ever wondered 
why fallen leaves rise in the air or trees sway or bend? Does the 
wind exert force on fallen leaves to make them rise or on trees 
to bend? Recall other similar effects of the force exerted by wind 
like slamming of doors or rattling of windows, or fluttering of 
clothes? How does the force exerted by wind make this happen? 
The force exerted by wind creates wind pressure which causes 
these effects. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship 
between force and pressure, and understand how they shape 
powerful natural events like thunderstorms and cyclones.
6.1 Pressure
 
Megha and her brother Pawan are going on a picnic. They walk 
to the picnic spot, carrying identical items in their bags (Fig. 6.1). 
On the way, Pawan keeps adjusting his bag, and looks 
uncomfortable. Megha asks, “Is there a problem with 
your bag?” Pawan responds, “Yes, it is hurting my 
shoulders.” Megha says, “Both our bags are equally 
heavy. Why does your bag hurt, and mine doesn’t?” 
Pawan reflects for a minute and says, “Perhaps, it is 
because of the difference in the straps of our bags. 
My bag has narrow straps while your bag has broad 
straps.”
Can the shape or size of the straps really make a 
difference? Let us try to find out.
When we carry a bag, we feel its weight because 
of the force of gravity acting on our shoulders. The 
weight of the bag with narrow straps acts on a 
smaller area of our shoulders, whereas the weight of 
the bag with broad straps is spread out over a larger 
area of our shoulders. It is due to this reason that we feel 
more comfortable carrying a bag with broader straps than one 
with narrow straps, although both bags have the same weight. 
Since the area over which the force acts is involved, we define 
a quantity called pressure, which is the force per unit area. 
So, 	
 Pressure = Force
Area
At this stage, we will consider only those forces which act 
perpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed.
Fig. 6.1: Megha and Pawan  
carrying their bags
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Broad straps reduce the pressure exerted by the bag on 
our shoulders as compared to narrow straps. Therefore, we 
feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broad straps. 
Can you now understand why it feels easier to lift a 
water-filled bucket with a broad handle than with a narrow 
handle (Fig. 6.2)? Similarly, we have seen that when people 
carry loads like pots or vegetable baskets on their heads, they 
often place a round piece of cloth under the loads (Fig. 6.3). In 
both cases, the objective is to reduce pressure by increasing 
the area over which the weight acts. 
Pressure is defined as the force per unit area. The SI unit 
of force is newton and that of area is metre2. Therefore, the 
SI unit of pressure is newton/metre2 (N/m2). This unit is also 
called a pascal, denoted by Pa.
If a force of 100 N is applied on a cardboard of area 2 m2, 
then the pressure applied on the cardboard will be:
Pressure =
= 50 N/m2

There are many situations in daily life where pressure plays 
a role. Conduct the activities given in Table 6.1 and record your 
observations. Explain how pressure influences the mode of 
action undertaken for each activity.

What can you conclude from your observations in Table 6.1?
We conclude that when the area over which a 
force applied is smaller, the resulting pressure is 
higher, making it easier to do certain tasks. This is 
why it is easier to drive a nail using its pointed end, 
and it is easier to cut an apple with the sharp edge 
of a knife.
You must have seen overhead water tanks 
(Fig. 6.4) in your locality, or on the rooftops of houses 
used for water supply. Why are these tanks always 
placed at a height?
Do liquids also exert pressure?
Let us find out by conducting the following activity.
Activity 6.1: Let us try and find out
	
z Take two transparent glass or plastic pipes of the same 
length (about 25 cm), but of different diameters, as shown 
in Fig. 6.5. 
	
z Take two good-quality rubber balloons. Attach 
them to one end of each pipe. 
	
z Clamp the pipes on a stand as shown in Fig. 6.5.
	
z Now, fill both the pipes with water up to the 
same level about halfway.
	
z Observe what happens to the balloons.
	
z Do both balloons bulge? Do they bulge to the 
same extent?
What can you infer from this activity? You must 
have observed that the two balloons bulge to the 
same extent. Why is it so? Notice that because of the 
different diameters, the weight of water in the two 
pipes is different. However, the bulge in both the 
balloons is the same. This means that the weight of 
water in the pipes could not be responsible for the 
extent of the bulge of the balloons. 
Could it be that the water column is exerting pressure? Yes, it 
is the pressure exerted by the water column which is responsible 
for the bulge. That is why equal water column heights produce 
equal bulges in the balloons, despite their different diameters.

Pour some more water in any one of the pipes 
used in Fig. 6.5. Observe the bulge of the balloon. 
Repeat this process a few times, adding more 
water each time and noting the extent of bulge as 
shown in Fig. 6.6. 
Do you see any relation between the amount 
of bulge of the rubber balloon and the height of 
the water column in the pipe? You must have 
observed that the bulge of the balloon increases 
as the height of the water column increases.
Thus, as the height of the water column in the pipe increases, 
the pressure at the bottom of the pipe also increases, which causes 
the balloon to bulge more. So, we can say that the pressure exerted 
by a liquid in a vessel depends on the height of its column. This 
is the reason why overhead tanks are placed at a height so that 
the pressure in the taps is increased, resulting in a good stream of 
water from the taps. 
Suppose you are living on the second floor of a three-storeyed 
building and an overhead water tank is placed on the top floor. 
Will you or your friend on the first floor receive a more powerful 
stream of tap water? Give reasons.

Do liquids also exert pressure on the walls of the container? 
Let us find out by conducting the following activity.
Activity 6.2: Let us find out
	
z Take a used plastic bottle and remove its cap. Make 
four small holes near the bottom around the sides 
using a needle or a nail. Make sure that the holes are at 
the same height from the bottom as shown in Fig. 6.7. 
(If you find it difficult to make a hole, you can slightly 
heat the needle and poke it to make holes.) 
	
z Seal the holes with a tape and fill the bottle with water. 
	
z Now, remove the tape from all holes at the same time.

Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones
You observe water flowing out through the holes on the 
sides of the bottle. What can you infer from this observation? 
It indicates that water also exerts pressure on the sides of a 
container. Therefore, we can conclude that liquids exert pressure 
not only at the bottom of the container, but also on its sides. In 
fact liquids exert pressure in all directions.
You must have seen water spurting out like a fountain from 
leaking joints or holes in water pipes. Can you explain why this 
happens? Is it due to the pressure exerted by water on the walls 
of the pipes?
Ever heard of ...
Do you know that the base of 
a dam is much broader than 
the top? This is because a 
broad base  not only supports 
the structure of the dam, but 
also withstands the horizontal 
water pressure near the bottom 
(Fig. 6.8). The water stored 
in the dam, exerts pressure 
horizontally on the side walls 
of the dam and vertically on 
the floor due to the height of the water level. The pressure which 
acts horizontally, is very large near its bottom. Thus, to withstand the 
pressure, the base of the dam is made broader.
Fig. 6.8: Dam
Let us now try to understand if air also exerts pressure.
6.2 Pressure Exerted by Air
You already know that air is all around us. The envelope of air 
surrounding the Earth is called atmosphere. The atmospheric 
air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other 
gases in small quantities. The atmosphere extends up to many 
kilometres above the surface of the Earth.
Let us find out if the atmosphere exerts pressure by performing 
the following activity.
Activity 6.3: Let us explore
	
z Take a paper plate, invert it and attach a stick to it as shown 
in Fig. 6.9a. Place it on a plain surface.
	
z Take two identical sheets of chart paper about 70 cm × 56 cm 
each. Fold one sheet twice and make a hole in the centre of 
Fig. 6.9: (a) Inverted 
paper plate setup
Stick
Paper plate
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
the folded chart paper sheet — big enough for the 
stick to come out. Place the folded sheet on top 
of the inverted paper plate as shown in Fig. 6.9b.
	
z Now, try to lift the paper plate covered with a 
folded sheet using the stick.
	
z Observe how much effort is needed to lift it.
	
z Now, place the second unfolded chart paper 
sheet in place of the folded sheet. Make a hole at 
the centre of this chart paper for the stick to pass 
through. Cover the paper plate with the unfolded 
chart paper as shown in Fig. 6.9 c.
	
z Lift the paper plate again and feel the effort 
needed in doing so.
	
z In which case is the lifting easier, with the folded 
or the unfolded chart paper covering the paper 
plate?
You would have observed that more effort is 
needed to lift the paper plate when it is covered with 
the unfolded chart paper, than with the folded chart 
paper. When we cover the paper plate with unfolded 
chart paper, the area of the covering sheet increases. 
The effort needed to lift the paper plate increases. 
Notice that the weight of the covering sheet has not 
changed. What can you infer from this? We can 
infer from these observations that air exerts force 
on the covering sheet, which makes it difficult to lift 
the paper plate. Moreover, this force increases with 
Fig. 6.10: A girl 
blowing a balloon
Fig. 6.9: (c) Inverted paper plate 
with unfolded chart paper
Fig. 6.9: (b) Inverted paper plate 
with two folds of chart paper
increase in the area of covering sheets. It means that the air is 
exerting a force on the paper plate, which increases as the area of 
the sheet covering it increases. As force per unit area is pressure, 
we can conclude that air exerts pressure on the paper sheet. In 
fact, air exerts pressure on all objects. The pressure exerted by 
air around us is known as the atmospheric pressure. 
You must have experienced that when you blow air into a 
balloon, it gets inflated. Why? This is because the air being filled 
inside the balloon exerts pressure on the walls of the balloon 
(Fig 6.10). Can we say that air exerts pressure in all directions? Yes, 
that is why the balloon expands in all directions. What happens 
when an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth? The 
air escapes from the balloon. Why does the air escape from 
the balloon? 
Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones
Have you ever wondered how large the atmospheric pressure 
is? Let us get an idea about its magnitude by performing the 
following activity.
Activity 6.4: Let us perform
	
z Take a good-quality rubber sucker. Press it firmly against a 
smooth flat surface (Fig. 6.11). 
	
z Do you realise that it sticks to the surface?
	
z Now, try to pull it off. Do you find it difficult to pull it off? 
When we press the sucker, most of the air between its cup 
and the surface on which it is placed is pushed out and the air 
pressure inside it is reduced. The sucker sticks to the surface 
because the pressure of air surrounding the sucker is higher 
than the pressure exerted by the air inside the sucker. To pull the 
sucker off the surface, the applied force should be strong enough 
to overcome the pressure difference between outside the sucker 
and inside the sucker.
Do you know how large the atmospheric pressure is? The force 
exerted by the atmospheric air column over an area 15 cm × 15 cm 
is nearly equal to the force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg 
(2250 N). The reason we are not crushed under this weight is that 
the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric 
pressure. This balances the pressure exerted from outside. The 
pressure inside our body is caused by the movement of fluids and 
gases in tissues and organs of the body.
6.3 Formation of Wind
You must have noticed that on some days, the wind blows strongly, 
whereas on other days, it is calm. Sometimes, wind becomes so 
strong that it causes damage to life and property. 
You must have seen that when an inflated balloon is kept 
without closing its mouth, the air from the balloon escapes. Recall 
that when there is a puncture in the bicycle tube, the air escapes 
and the tube collapses. In both of these cases, does air move from 
a high pressure region to a low pressure region?  
The SI unit of pressure is N/m2, also known as pascal (Pa). However, 
the practical unit of air pressure is millibar (mb), which is equal to 
100 Pa. Air pressure is also expressed in hectopascal (hPa), which is 
equal to 100 Pa.

A step further
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Let us find out from the following activity.
Activity 6.5: Let us observe
	
z Take two similar balloons made of thin rubber, 
and a drinking straw.
	
z Insert one end of the straw into one balloon and 
secure it with a rubber band or thread.
	
z Now inflate the second balloon and hold its mouth 
with your fingers, so that air does not escape.
	
z Insert the free end of the straw into the neck of 
the inflated balloon and secure it with a rubber 
band or thread. Make sure that the air does not leak from the 
balloon as the straw is inserted in it. Now you have one end 
of the straw inside the inflated balloon and the other end 
inside the uninflated balloon as shown in Fig. 6.12.
	
z Predict what would happen to the balloons.
	
z Observe what happens to both the balloons. Did it happen as 
predicted?
	
z Do you observe any change in the size of the balloons? Write 
down your observations.
....................................................................................................................
What can be the reason for the change in the sizes of the 
balloons? The air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher 
than that in the uninflated balloon. As a result, some air moves 
from the inflated balloon to the uninflated balloon, resulting in 
changes in the size of both the balloons.
Do you notice that after some time both the balloons attain 
almost the same size and the flow of air stops? Why does the air 
flow stop? The flow of air continues till the air pressure in the 
inflated balloon is higher than the air pressure in the uninflated 
balloon. The air flow stops when the pressure in both balloons 
becomes equal. At this stage, both balloons are almost of the 
same size. Thus, we can conclude that air moves from a region of 
high air pressure to a region of low air pressure. 
You can relate this conclusion to the directions of the sea breeze 
and land breeze, which you studied in Curiosity, Grade 7. As land 
gets heated faster than water during the day, the air above the land 
How do winds form?
Does the difference in air 
pressure have anything to do 
with the formation of winds?
Fig. 6.12: Air moves from a 
high pressure region to a low 
pressure region
Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones
becomes warmer and lighter. Hence, it rises, creating an area of low 
pressure. The air from the high pressure region of the sea blows to 
the low pressure region which develops on the land, resulting in a 
sea breeze. At night, the water is warmer than the land. Therefore, 
a low pressure area develops above the sea. As a result, wind 
blows from the land to the sea, giving rise to land breeze. Thus, the 
phenomenon of land breeze and sea breeze is mainly due to the 
pressure differences over the land and the sea.
If we could measure the speed of the escaping air in Activity 6.5, 
we would find that the speed of the air is higher if the pressure 
difference is higher.
I have read that high-speed 
winds can blow off roofs.
I wonder how?
6.4 High-Speed Winds Result in Lowering 
of Air Pressure
Activity 6.6: Let us observe
	
z Take two balloons of the same size.
	
z Inflate both balloons and tie strings to them.
	
z Hang the two balloons from a stick, leaving a 
gap of 6–10 cm (Fig. 6.13).
	
z Now, blow air into the narrow space between 
the balloons.
	
z What happens to the balloons? Note down 
your observations.
	
z Now blow harder and observe.
When you blow between the two balloons, you observe that they 
move towards each other. This happens because when you blow 
air between the balloons, a low pressure area is created between 
them. The higher air pressure surrounding the balloon pushes 
them towards each other. You must have observed that blowing 
harder increases the speed at which the balloons approach each 
other. What can you infer from this activity? We infer that high 
speed winds are accompanied by a reduced air pressure.
Fig. 6.13: Blowing between two balloons
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
When high-speed winds blow over houses, 
a low-pressure area is created over them, 
as high-speed winds are accompanied by a 
reduced pressure. Therefore, the air pressure 
above the roofs of the houses is lower than the 
pressure below them. If the pressure difference 
is large and the roofs are weak, they may be 
blown away, as shown in Fig. 6.14 a. That is 
why it is safer to keep doors and windows of 
the houses open during storms with high-speed 
winds. When the same wind moves over the 
roofs, and through the houses, the pressure 
difference between inside of the houses and 
over the roofs is reduced to a large extent. This 
helps prevent the roofs from being blown off as 
shown in Fig. 6.14 b.
You must have experienced that when 
high-speed winds blow during storms, they 
are sometimes accompanied by thunder and 
lightning. Let us learn more about them.
6.5 Storms, Thunderstorms, and Lightning
Fig. 6.14: (b) Roof of a house intact
Fig. 6.14: (a) Roof of a house 
blown away
Have you heard the sound of 
thunder and seen lightning 
during the rainy season?
Yes, the sound of thunder 
is so frightening! Usually 
there is heavy rainfall too.
When land gets heated, the warm and moist air, being 
lighter, rises, thereby creating a low pressure area. Cooler 
air from the surrounding high-pressure areas flows to 
take its place. This air, in turn, gets heated and rises. 
This results in a continuous process of wind circulation. 
As the rising air expands, it cools and moisture in it 
condenses to form water droplets, creating clouds. 
The water droplets merge to form heavier drops, 
which come down as rain, hail, or snow. The strong 
winds accompanied by rain is called a storm. In hot, 
humid, and tropical regions like India, storms are 
more frequent. Under certain conditions, warm air 
rises to great heights that the low temperature there 
converts water droplets into ice particles.
Strong winds blowing upwards and downwards 
(Fig. 6.15) facilitate rubbing between water droplets

up and down

Cool air

and ice particles. You have learnt in the chapter 
‘Exploring Forces’ that when two objects are rubbed 
against each other, they get charged. In this case, strong 
winds blowing upwards and downwards and rubbing 
against each other cause static electric charges to 
develop within the clouds.
The positively charged lighter ice particles move 
upwards and occupy the upper part of the clouds. The 
negatively charged heavier water droplets occupy the 
lower part of the clouds. Thus, a charge separation 
within the cloud takes place. Also, when the negatively 
charged lower part of the cloud moves closer to the 
ground, it causes the ground and nearby objects, such as trees or 
buildings, to become positively charged (Fig. 6.16).
Normally, air acts as an electrical insulator and does not 
let opposite charges meet. But when the build up of charges 
becomes very large, the insulating property of air breaks down. 
A sudden flow of charges takes place, producing a bright flash of 
light called lightning.
Lightning can occur as opposite charges collide within a cloud, 
between clouds, or between clouds and the ground. Lightning 
rapidly heats up the air around it, causing the air to expand and 
produce a loud sound known as thunder. A storm accompanied 
by lightning and thunder is called a thunderstorm.
A step further
Isolated and localised thunderstorms can sometimes occur in various 
regions of India. These thunderstorms are known by various names 
such as Kalboishakhi in West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand and 
Bordoisila in Assam. They occur before the arrival of the monsoon, 
thereby helping kharif crops to grow. In Kerala, Karnataka, and 
Tamil Nadu, they are known as mango showers as they support the 
ripening of mangoes. Local thunderstorms in Karnataka help in the 
growth of coffee plants.
Lightning can be dangerous! It can ignite fires, 
damage buildings, and cause severe burns or death 
in humans and animals. We must take necessary 
precautions and protect ourselves from lightning. 
During lightning, stay away from tall objects, find a 
low-lying open area and crouch down, and minimise 
contact with the ground. Do not lie down flat. Avoid 
using an umbrella with a metallic rod. If you are in 
water, get out of it. If you are inside a bus or a car, you 
are comparatively safer.
 Fig. 6.16: Lightning

A lightning conductor is a 
metallic rod installed along the 
walls of buildings during their 
construction. One end of the 
rod is pointed. This end is kept 
higher than the highest point of 
the building (Fig. 6.18). The other 
end of the rod is buried deep in 
the ground. The rod provides 
easy path for the transfer of 
electric charges into the ground.

6.6 Cyclone
Cyclones are large storms that form over warm ocean waters. 
As the ocean water gets heated, the warm and moist air above 
it rises. As the moist air rises, the water vapour condenses to 
form raindrops. We know that during evaporation, 
water takes up heat to change into vapour. When 
this water vapour condenses into raindrops, heat is 
released back into the atmosphere. This causes further 
warming of the ascending air leading it to rise even 
further, creating an even lower pressure. Air from the 
surrounding regions rushes in and it also starts rising. 
Earth’s rotation causes the moving air to spin (Fig. 6.19). 
This cycle is repeated, resulting in the creation of a very 
low-pressure area with high-speed winds revolving 
around it. This spinning system of clouds, winds, and 
rain is called a cyclone.
In a cyclone, the region of lowest 
pressure is at the centre, known as the eye 
of the cyclone. At the eye of the cyclone, 
the wind is calm, but the surrounding 
region experiences strong winds and 
heavy rainfall. As a cyclone moves from the 
ocean towards the land, it generates higher 
wind speeds compared to the wind speeds 
produced by regular thunderstorms. Once 
the cyclone reaches land, the source of 
moist air is cut off and it gradually loses its 
strength.

Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones
Even as a cyclone loses its strength while travelling over land, 
it leaves behind a trail of destruction that can take months or even 
years to repair. Cyclones can be extremely destructive. For example, 
the Amphan cyclone in 2020 had peak wind speeds of 270 km/h. 
Strong winds during a cyclone  push ocean water towards the 
shore, creating a wall of water that can be as high as 3–12 metres. 
This surge of water can flood coastal areas and even areas far 
from the sea. The heavy rainfall which accompanies a cyclone 
may cause rivers to overflow and can also trigger landslides. 
Seawater that rushes inland can contaminate drinking water 
sources and damage farmland. The salt in seawater can make soil 
less fertile, affecting crops. Roads may get blocked due to fallen 
trees and debris, making it difficult for help to reach the affected 
areas. Power outages can last for days, disrupting emergency 
services and daily life. 
How can we protect ourselves during cyclones? It is important 
to stay updated on weather reports and periodic alerts, and 
warnings issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). 
Thanks to the weather monitoring satellites, today we can 
track cyclones and predict their path, helping us reduce their 
impact on life and property. Several national and international 
organisations work together to monitor cyclone-related disasters. 
If you live in a cyclone-prone area, keep an emergency kit ready 
with essential items. During a cyclone, quickly move to a nearby 
designated cyclone shelter.
Let us wrap up!
Cool air rushes to occupy the low-pressure area.
Warm air rises, creating a low-pressure area.
Warm air rises, cools, and the water vapour condenses to 
form clouds.
Bigger water drops in the clouds fall to the ground as rain, 
hail, or snow.
Positive and negative charges are created in the clouds by 
strong winds blowing upwards and downwards.
Under certain weather conditions, storms may develop into 
cyclones.
When positive and negative charges meet, they cause 
lightning. Lightning may occur within a cloud, between 
clouds, or between a cloud and the ground.

(iii)	 A water tank is placed on the roof of a building at a height 
‘H’. To get water with more pressure on the ground floor, 
one has to 
	
(a)	increase the height ‘H’ at which the tank is placed.
	
(b)	decrease the height ‘H’ at which the tank is placed.
	
(c)	replace the tank with another tank of the same height 
that can hold more water. 
	
(d)	replace the tank with another tank of the same height 
that can hold less water.
	
(iv)	 Two vessels, A and B contain water up to the 
same level as shown in Fig. 6.22. PA and PB is 
the pressure at the bottom of the vessels. FA 
and FB is the force exerted by the water at the 
bottom of the vessels A and B.
	
(a)	PA = PB, FA = FB
	
(b)	PA = PB, FA <FB
	
(c)	PA < PB, FA = FB
	
(d)	PA > PB, FA > FB
2.	 State whether the following statements are True [T] or 
False [F].
(i)	 Air flows from a region of higher pressure to a region of 
lower pressure. [    ]
(ii)	 Liquids exert pressure only at the bottom of a 
container. [    ]
(iii)	 Weather is stormy at the eye of a cyclone. [    ]
(iv)	 During a thunderstorm, it is safer to be in a 
car. [    ]
3.	 Fig. 6.23 a shows a boy lying horizontally, and 
Fig. 6.23 b shows the boy standing vertically on a 
loose sand bed. In which case does the boy sink 
more in sand? Give reasons.
4.	 An elephant stands on four feet. If the area 
covered by one foot is 0.25 m2, calculate the 
pressure exerted by the elephant on the ground 
if its weight is 20000 N.
