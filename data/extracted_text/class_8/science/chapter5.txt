Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces
It was a windy day. Sonali and Ragini were excited to go 
cycling. Their summer vacation had just begun, and they wanted 
to explore the beautiful landscapes around their village. After 
pumping air into their bicycle tyres, they set off. As they rode 
through the village, the wind rushed past them. “Oh no! The 
wind is pushing me hard!” said Ragini. Smiling, Sonali replied, 
“We are riding against the wind. We must push our pedals harder 
to move faster.”
Their ride took them up a long path to a hilltop. Some parts 
of the road were rough where they found it hard to pedal, while 
other parts were smoother. When they reached the top and were 
enjoying the view, they heard thunder and saw flashes of lightning 
at a distance. Even though it looked beautiful, they decided to 
head back immediately. On the way back, while passing a herd of 
sheep, they pressed their bicycle bells and turned the handles to 
change direction.
As they were coming down the slope of the hill, they realised 
that their bicycles were moving down at a great speed even 
though they were not pedalling! Sonali yelled, “It’s thrilling! It 
seems something is pulling us downhill, what could it be?”
5.1 What Is a Force?
Let us try to experience the push and the pull.
Activity 5.1: Let us explore
	
z Take a large cardboard box. 
	
z Try moving the box in as many different ways as you can 
think of.
Did you move the box in any other way than shown in Fig. 5.1? 
In all the ways that you might have used to move the box, you 
had to apply a push or pull to the box. Generally, the push or pull 
applied on an object is called force in science.

5.2 What Can a Force Do to the Bodies on 
Which It Is Applied?
We experience push or pull in our daily lives all the time, often 
without even realising it. Let us recall some of these experiences 
and analyse them.
Activity 5.2: Let us analyse
	
z Think of situations where a force (push or pull) is applied 
and list them in Table 5.1.
	
z Analyse each situation and write the effect of the force 
in Table 5.1. Some situations and their effects are already 
listed for you.

What do you conclude from these examples? Does a force 
cause a moving object to stop? Can it change speed, or direction 
of motion, or change the shape of an object?
Fig. 5.2: Applying force on objects
Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces
In everyday life, we come across many situations where a force 
is applied, for example, opening a drawer, stretching a rubber 
band, a fielder stopping a ball, kicking a football, applying brakes 
on a moving bicycle, rolling a chapati, or turning the steering 
handle of an autorickshaw. What effect can the application of 
force have on objects?
The force applied on an object may
	
z make an object move from rest.
	
z change the speed of an object if it is moving.
	
z change the direction of motion of an object.
	
z bring about a change in the shape of an object.
	
z cause some or all of these effects.
5.3 Are Forces an Interaction Between Two 
or More Objects?
When you push a table, your hand is one object applying force 
on another object — the table. Here, we say that your hand and 
the table are two objects interacting with each other. 
Think of all the actions listed in Table 5.1. How many objects 
are involved in each of the actions? Do you notice that forces 
result only when two objects are interacting in some way or 
the other? From these examples, we can infer that at least two 
objects must interact for a force to come into play.
A force is a push or pull on an object resulting from the 
object’s interaction with another object. The SI unit of force is 
newton (written with a small ‘n’) and its symbol is N.
A step further
Suppose an object is at rest. Does it mean that no force is acting 
on this object? It means that the forces acting on the object are 
balancing one another. You will learn about balanced forces in 
higher grades.
Does 
this 
mean 
that 
whenever there is a change 
in speed or direction, or 
change in shape, a force is 
acting on the object?
Yes, none of these take 
place without the action 
of force.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Fig. 5.3: Use of muscular force by living beings
A step further
When you pushed the table with your hand, did you feel a force 
on your hand too? The moment you stopped pushing, the force on 
your hand disappeared. Whenever two objects interact, each object 
experiences a force from the other. As soon as the interaction 
ceases, the two objects no longer experience the force. 
5.4 What Are the Different Types of Forces?
5.4.1 Contact forces
In many situations, we find that to apply a force on an object, 
physical contact is necessary between our body and the object. 
This contact can be direct, such as using our hands or other body 
parts, or indirect, such as using a stick or rope. Forces of this 
type which act only when there is physical contact between the 
objects are called contact forces.
Muscular force
An example of contact force is muscular force. When we perform 
any physical activity, such as walking, running, lifting, pushing, 
jumping, or stretching, the force is caused by the action of muscles 
in our body. The force resulting due to the action of muscles is 
known as muscular force. Muscular force occurs when muscles 
contract and elongate while doing any activity. 
Animals, birds, fish, and insects use muscular forces for 
movement and survival.
Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces
Humans used the muscular force of some animals to carry 
out many tasks for a long time.
Fig. 5.4: Use of muscular force of animals to assist with human tasks
Ever heard of ...
Muscular force plays an important role in many functions inside 
our body too. This force helps us chew food and push it through 
the alimentary canal during the process of digestion. The expansion 
and contraction of our heart muscles allows the blood to circulate 
in our body — a process essential for survival.
Friction
A ball rolling on a flat ground stops on its own 
after some time. If we stop pedalling our bicycle 
on a flat road, it slows down and comes to a stop. 
If the road is rough, it stops sooner than on a smoother road. 
You must have come across many such experiences. What causes 
the change in the speed of objects in such situations? We have 
learnt earlier that a force is essential to change the speed of an 
object. However, in all these situations no force appears to be 
acting on the objects, yet their speed gradually decreases and 
they come to a stop after some time. Is it possible that some force 
is indeed acting on them? Which force is that?
Activity 5.3: Let us investigate
	
z Take an object with a flat base (such as an empty lunch box/ 
geometry box/ a notebook) and place it on a table or floor.
	
z Gently push it and observe. Does it stop after travelling some 
distance? Is there a force acting on it which brings it to rest?
	
z Now repeat by pushing the object in the opposite direction. 
Does it stop again after travelling some distance?
Is there any other 
contact force?
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
On pushing, the object stops after sliding a certain 
distance. This must be due to a force acting between the 
surfaces of the sliding object and the table or floor which 
are in contact. This force must be acting on the object in a 
direction opposite to its direction of motion. This force is 
what brings the object to a stop. 
The force that comes into play when an object moves 
or tries to move over another surface is called the force 
of friction or simply friction. Friction always acts in a 
direction opposite to the direction in which the object is 
moving or trying to move. The force of friction is a contact 
force since it arises due to two surfaces in contact.
Friction arises due to the irregularities in the two surfaces in 
contact. Even surfaces which appear smooth, have a large number 
of minute irregularities (Fig. 5.6). When placed in contact, the 
irregularities of two surfaces lock into each other and oppose 
any effort to move one surface over the other.
Fig. 5.6: Friction between two surfaces due to irregularities
Fig. 5.5: Friction acts between 
two surfaces and opposes the 
motion of the object.
Activity 5.4: Let us explore
	
z Try Activity 5.3 again, but this time place the same object on 
different surfaces, such as glass, cloth, wood, ceramic tile, 
and sand. 
	
z Does the object stop after travelling the same distance as in 
Activity 5.3?
	
z Does the object stop at the same distance on all surfaces?
For different surfaces, the object stops after moving different 
distances so we can say that the force of friction depends upon 
the nature of the surfaces in contact. Friction is greater on rough 
surfaces.
A step further
Does the force or friction act only if the objects are moving on solid 
surfaces? What about objects moving through liquids and gases? Air, 
water, and other liquids also exert force of friction on the objects 
moving through them. Hence the objects, such as aeroplanes, ships, 
boats, or high-speed trains are designed with specific shapes to 
reduce the force of friction due to the air or water around them.
Does this mean that
the force of friction
will be greater if the
surfaces are rough?
Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces
5.4.2 Non-contact forces
There are forces whose effect can be experienced even if the 
objects are not in contact. These forces are called non-contact 
forces. Let us learn about non-contact forces.
Magnetic force
Do you remember learning about magnets in the chapter 
‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? We learnt that a 
magnet attracts objects made of magnetic materials. When two 
magnets are brought close to each other, like poles (North–North, 
South–South) repel each other while unlike poles (North–South) 
attract each other. In an earlier chapter of this book, we also learnt 
about electromagnets which behave like magnets. Attraction 
and repulsion between objects are also a form of push and pull, 
that is, a force. Can you recall that a magnet could exert force on 
another magnet or a magnetic material without being in contact 
with it?
Activity 5.5: Let us test
	
z Take two ring magnets and a wooden stick.
	
z While holding the stick in a vertical position over a wooden 
table, insert one ring magnet onto the stick (Fig. 5.7).
	
z Now insert the second ring magnet above it such that the like 
poles of the two magnets face each other. Does the second 
magnet stay floating above the first magnet?
	
z Try pushing the second magnet down gently. Do you feel a 
force on it?
	
z Now, reverse the poles of both the magnets. Does the second 
magnet still remain floating?
We find that a magnet can exert force on another magnet 
without being in contact with it.
The force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or a 
magnetic material is called magnetic force. Since a magnet can 
exert a force from a distance without being in contact it is called 
a non-contact force.
Are there more such forces which act from a distance?
Fig. 5.7: Force between 
two ring magnets
Is it essential for an object 
applying force on another object 
to always be in contact with it?
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Electrostatic force
Activity 5.6: Let us experiment
	
z Take a plastic scale or a plastic straw, a piece of 
polythene, and small pieces of paper.
	
z Rub plastic scale/straw vigorously with polythene.
	
z Do not touch the rubbed part with your hand or 
any metal object.
	
z Now, bring it close to the small pieces of paper placed 
on a table, taking care not to touch the paper pieces 
(Fig. 5.8). Do you notice something surprising?
The paper pieces get pulled towards the plastic scale/straw 
and stick to it when it is brought close to paper pieces. Why does 
this happen?
When two objects of certain materials are rubbed together, 
electrical charges build up on their surfaces. These charges are 
called static charges as they do not move by themselves. The 
object that acquires static charges is said to be a charged object. 
A charged object attracts, that is, exerts a force on uncharged 
objects made of certain materials, such as small pieces of paper. 
This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact.
Let us do another activity with objects made of different 
materials.
Activity 5.7: Let us experiment
	
z Take two balloons, a length of thread, and a woollen 
cloth.
	
z Inflate two balloons and hang them in such a way that 
they do not touch each other as shown in Fig. 5.9a. 
	
z Rub both balloons with the woollen cloth and release 
them. Be careful not to touch the rubbed balloons 
with your fingers. What do you observe?
We observe that the balloons move away from each 
other as if they are repelling each other (Fig. 5.9b).
	
z Now bring the woollen cloth used for rubbing 
the balloons close to one of the rubbed balloons. 
What happens?
They move towards each other as if they are attracting 
each other. What do we infer from these observations?
Fig. 5.8: Charged plastic scale 
attracting small paper pieces
Fig. 5.9: (a) Two uncharged 
balloons; (b) Two charged 
balloons repelling each other
(a)
(b)
Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces
We found that the two similarly charged 
balloons repel each other whereas a charged 
balloon and the woollen cloth (with which the 
balloon was rubbed) attract each other. Does 
this indicate that the charge on the balloon is of a different kind 
from the charge on the woollen cloth?  
Since the balloons were charged in the same way, we can say 
that they have acquired similar charges. As the similarly charged 
balloons repelled each other, we can infer that similar (like) 
charges repel each other. Both the rubbing object and the rubbed 
object get charged but they acquire opposite kind of charges. 
Their attraction shows that opposite kind (unlike) of charges 
attract each other. The two kinds of static charges are said to be 
‘positive’ and ‘negative’.
The force exerted by a charged body on another charged 
body or an uncharged body is called electrostatic force. It is a 
non-contact force.
Does it mean that 
there are two kinds of 
electrical charges?
Gravitational force
Activity 5.8: Let us observe
	
z Take a ball and throw it vertically upwards. Does it come 
down?
	
z Now throw it again, but this time harder. Does it still fall 
back down to the ground?
Think about different situations around you where any object 
thrown up in any direction, finally falls or comes back to the 
ground or floor.
Fig. 5.10: Some objects falling towards the Earth
A step further
When the charges move, they constitute an electric current in an 
electrical circuit. It is the same current which makes a lamp glow 
or generates a heating effect or a magnetic effect.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Since all the objects fall towards the Earth, it means the Earth 
attracts (pulls) them. The force with which the Earth attracts objects 
towards itself is called the gravitational force. The gravitational 
force exerted by the Earth is also called force of gravity or 
simply gravity. 
Since the gravitational force 
acts without contact with the object 
it attracts, it is a non-contact force. 
Gravitational force is always an 
attractive force, unlike magnetic 
force or electrostatic force, which 
can either be attractive or repulsive.
You might have noticed that 
when an object is dropped from a 
height, it takes a straight vertical 
path downwards before touching 
the ground (Fig.  5.11a). When 
an object is thrown vertically 
upwards, the object moves up 
straight, 
slows 
down, 
stops 
momentarily at the top, and then 
takes a straight vertical path 
downwards (Fig. 5.11b).
While going up, the speed 
of the object goes on decreasing till the object comes to a stop, 
its direction of motion changes and while coming down the 
speed goes on increasing. We say that the object 
undergoes a vertical motion when it moves in 
a vertical direction under the influence of the 
gravitational force.
5.5 Weight and Its Measurement 
The force with which the Earth pulls an object towards itself is 
called the weight of the object. The weight measures how strongly 
an object is pulled by the Earth. Since the weight is a force, it is 
measured in the same unit as that of force. Therefore, SI unit of 
weight is also newton (N).

there 
any 
force 
which acts on them? 
What exerts this force?

all

objects fall towards

with equal force?

Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces
Let us now try to find out if the Earth pulls every object with 
equal force.
Activity 5.9: Let us explore
	
z Take a spring and a few objects of different masses, 
such as a pencil box, a tiffin box, and a small stone.
	
z Hang one end of the spring from a nail. From the other 
end, hang an object and observe the spring. Does the 
spring stretch? 
	
z Now hang the other objects, one by one and notice the 
stretch in the spring each time. Is the stretch caused by 
each object the same?
When an object is hung from a spring, the spring 
stretches due to the force applied on the object by the Earth. 
We find that the stretch caused in the spring is different 
for different objects. This indicates that the Earth pulls 
different objects with different forces, that is, the weight 
of different objects is different. Can we use the spring to 
measure the weight of an object?
A step further
A spring balance is a simple device used to measure weight (force). 
It consists of a spring fixed at one end, with a hook attached at 
the other end. When we hang an object from the hook, the spring 
stretches, and the amount of stretching gives the weight of the object. 
There is a scale on the balance which is marked to show the weight 
(force) in newton. Usually, there is also another scale to show the 
corresponding values of mass in gram (g). These values have been 
marked with the assumption that the spring balance is used on the 
Earth, with the Earth’s gravitational force attracting the object.
(b)
Fig. 5.12: (a) A hanging spring; 
(b) Two different objects hung 
from the spring
(a)
Let us learn to measure the weight using a spring balance. But 
first, let us familiarise ourselves with a spring balance the way 
we did with thermometer earlier (in the chapter ‘Temperature 
and Its Measurement’ in Curiosity, Grade 6).
Activity 5.10: Let us observe
	
z Look at the spring balance shown in Fig. 5.13 carefully. What 
is the maximum weight it can measure? 
The maximum weight it can measure is 10 N. Thus, this scale 
has a range of 0 to 10 N.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Let us now try to find the smallest value of weight that 
can be measured by the spring balance.
Activity 5.11: Let us calculate
	
z Look at the spring balance shown in Fig. 5.13 and note 
down the following:
	
{
How much is the weight difference indicated 
between the two bigger marks? 
The weight difference indicated between 0 and 01 N 
or between 01 N and 02 N is 1 N.
	
{
How many divisions (shown by smaller marks) are 
there between these two bigger marks?
There are 5 divisions between these marks.
	
{
How much weight does one small division indicate? 
Fig. 5.14: Object suspended 
from a spring balance
One small division can read 
1 N
5  = 0.2 N.
So, the smallest value that the spring balance can read is 0.2 N.
Now using this method, calculate the smallest value of weight 
that can be measured with the spring balance given to you. Your 
school laboratory may have spring balances for which the range and 
the value of the smallest division may be different. It is, therefore, 
always necessary to look carefully at the spring balance (or any 
other instrument) you are about to use.
Let us now learn how to measure weight using a spring balance.
Activity 5.12: Let us measure
	
z Take a spring balance and a few objects. Keep in mind that 
the objects should not be heavier than the maximum value of 
weight the spring balance can measure, otherwise it may get 
damaged.
	
z Suspend the objects one by one from the hook (Fig. 5.14). Read 
the scale for weight carefully and record your observations 
in the Table 5.2.

Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces
You can repeat Activities 5.10 to 5.12 for the mass scale shown 
on the left side on the spring balance (Fig. 5.13) to measure the 
mass of an object.
A step further
The mass of an object can be measured indirectly by measuring its 
weight (using a spring balance) or by comparing its weight with the 
weight of an object of a known mass (using a beam balance). Since 
the weight of an object remains almost the same everywhere on the 
Earth, so for all practical purposes it is acceptable to weigh an object 
to find its mass.
As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Materials 
Around Us’ in Curiosity, Grade 6), mass is the amount 
of matter in an object and is measured in grams (g) 
or kilograms (kg). Its value remains the same at every 
place. Weight, on the other hand, is the gravitational force 
with which the Earth (or another planet) pulls an object. Since 
gravitational force can vary very slightly from place to place on 
the Earth (and can be very different on different planets), weight 
can change, but mass does not.
What is the difference 
between weight and 
mass?
A step further
The gravitational force of different planets on an object is different. 
Thus, the weight of an object is different on different planets, as shown 
in the following table, even though its mass remains the same.
Planet

Moon
Mars
Venus
Jupiter

the object 10 N

25.4 N
A step further
In everyday life, particularly for the goods we commonly use, we 
are more interested in the amount of matter in an object (its mass), 
rather than the force applied by the Earth upon it (its weight). 
However, though while the units of mass are used, instead of the 
term mass, the term weight is typically used. For example, it is said 
that the weight of the wheat bag is 10 kg. But in scientific use, this 
is not correct and it is important to use the correct terms with their 
correct units, even if every day language is more casual.

Activity 5.13: Let us investigate
	
z Take an empty plastic bottle (with its lid closed tightly) and a 
bucket full of water.
	
z Push the bottle in the water (Fig. 5.15). Do you feel an upward 
push? Release the bottle. Does it bounce up?
You would have felt an upward push and the bottle bounces 
back to the surface of the water. This indicates that water applies 
a force on the bottle in the upward direction. In fact, all liquids 
apply a similar force. The force applied by a liquid on an object 
in the upward direction is known as upthrust or buoyant force. 
When an object is placed in a liquid, the gravitational force due 
to the Earth acts on it downwards. But a buoyant force is applied 
on it by the liquid in the upward direction. If the gravitational 
force is more than the buoyant force, the object sinks, but if the 
two forces are equal, the object floats. One of the factors on which 
the buoyant force depends upon, is the density of the liquid. You 
will learn about density in a later chapter of this book.
Fig. 5.15: Plastic bottle 
in water
A step further
Archimedes, a famous Greek scientist, discovered that when an 
object is fully or partially immersed in a liquid, it experiences an 
upward force which is equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces. 
This is known as Archimedes’ Principle. If the weight of a liquid 
displaced by an object is smaller than the weight of the object, the 
object will sink in the liquid. If the weight of the liquid displaced is 
equal to the weight of the object, the object will float in the liquid.
5.6 Floating and Sinking 
While taking out water from 
a bucket filled with water 
using a mug, do you notice 
that the mug feels lighter 
when it is inside water? Let 
us try to understand this.
If we place some objects on water, some of 
them float, while others fall to the bottom. 
The gravitational force of the Earth is 
acting on all objects, then why don’t all 
objects fall to the bottom?
Ever heard of ...
There are some rocks which can float on water. 
One such rock is Pumice, which is formed during 
volcanic eruptions. When lava with lots of gas and 
water vapour cools quickly, it traps tiny bubbles of 
gas inside. This creates a light, porous rock — filled 
with air pockets which is less dense than water and floats on it.

and then falls back to the ground. Name the forces acting on 
the ball and specify their directions.
(i)	 During its upward motion
(ii)	 During its downward motion
(iii)	 At its topmost position
6.	 A ball is released from the point P and moves along an 
inclined plane and then along a horizontal surface as 
shown in the Fig. 5.16. It comes to stop at the point A on the 
horizontal surface. Think of a way so that when the ball is 
released from the same point P, it stops (i) before the point A 
(ii) after crossing the point A.

7.	 Why do we sometimes slip on smooth surfaces like ice or 
polished floors? Explain.
8.	 Is any force being applied to an object in a non-uniform 
motion? 
9.	 The weight of an object on the Moon becomes one-sixth of its 
weight on the Earth. What causes this change? Does the mass 
of the object also become one-sixth of its mass on the Earth?

10.	 Three objects 1, 2, and 3 of the same size and shape but made 
of different materials are placed in the water. 
They dip to different depths as shown in Fig. 5.17. 
If the weights of the three objects 1, 2, and 3 are 
w1, w2, and w3, respectively, then 
(i)	 w1 = w2 = w3
(ii)	 w1 > w2 > w3
(iii)	 w2 > w3 > w1
(iv)	 w3 > w1 > w2
Discover, design, and debate
	
z Collect objects made of different materials, such as plastic, 
wool, silk, rubber, polythene sheet, paper, and metals. 
Rub one material with another and check if it attracts small 
pieces of paper or not, that is, whether it gets charged or not. 
Record your observations in a systematic manner and write 
a research paper.
	
z Imagine a scenario where the gravity disappears. Develop a 
story. Create a cartoon strip to present your story.
	
z Organise a discussion in your class on the topic: Friction — a 
necessity or a problem? Make a note of the discussion and 
state where friction is a necessity and when it is a problem.
	
z Make your own spring balance with the help of your teacher 
and calibrate it using standard weights. Now measure the 
weights of different objects and calculate the ratio of the 
weight and mass of different objects. Do you observe a 
pattern?
	
z An electroscope is a device which can determine whether 
an object is electrically charged. You can make your own 
electroscope (Fig. 5.18) in your class with the help of your 
teacher, test the device. Explore in what other ways you may 
use this electroscope.
