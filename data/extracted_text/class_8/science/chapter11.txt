Chapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies
It was Makar Sankranti, and Meera was in Ahmedabad for the 
Patang Mahotsav, the International Kite Festival. As she looked 
up at the sky filled with colourful kites, she noticed the Moon 
shining during the daytime. She was surprised as she had always 
thought the Moon appeared only at night. Also, the Moon did 
not appear like a full circle, but that didn’t surprise her as much. 
She knew its shape changed every night. Still, it got her thinking. 
She remembered learning that the Moon is spherical and shines 
by reflecting sunlight. Then why isn’t the whole Moon visible 
every night? For a moment, she wondered if it was due to a 
lunar eclipse. But eclipses are rare and brief. So, what causes the 
Moon’s changing shape?
11.1 How Does the Moon’s Appearance 
Change and Why?
Let us carefully watch the Moon to understand how its 
appearance changes over a month. You may have done a similar 
activity earlier, but let us now do it in more detail. Begin this 
activity from the sunrise after a full Moon day, that is when it is 
easiest to spot the Moon in the sky.
Activity 11.1: Let us explore*
	
z Spot the Moon at sunrise in the western direction on the first 
day after the full Moon.
	
z Make a table similar to Table 11.1 in your notebook. Document 
the following:
	
{
Date
	
{
When you saw the Moon (at sunrise or sunset)?
	
{
Shade the corresponding Circle with pencil to show the 
bright portion of the Moon as shown in Fig. 11.1.
	
z From the second day onwards also document the following.
	
{
Is the size of bright portion of the Moon increasing or 
decreasing from the previous day.
	
{
Whether the Moon appears closer to or farther from the 
Sun in the sky than the day before.
	
z After about 15 days, you may not be able to see the Moon at 
sunrise or sunset. For the next 15 days, carry out this activity 
at sunset.

Table 11.1: Documenting changes in the Moon’s appearance
Analyse the data recorded by you in Table 11.1. Did the Moon 
appear different each day? Was the Moon visible on all days? 
Did the Moon appear at the same position in the sky as on the 
previous day? 
11.1.1 Phases of the Moon
You may have observed that the 
bright portion of the Moon decreases 
from a full circle to a half circle 
in about a week, as shown in 
Fig. 11.2. The bright portion continues 
to shrink for another week until it 
is no longer visible. This two-week 
period is called the waning period of 
the Moon. Different names are given 
to the Moon’s visible shapes during 
this cycle (Fig. 11.2). The day when 
the Moon appears as a full bright 
circle is called the full Moon day (or 
Purnima), and the day when it is not 
visible is called the new Moon day 
(or Amavasya).
After the new Moon, its bright side 
grows to a half circle in about a week 
and to a full circle (full Moon) in another 
week. The period when the bright part 
of the Moon increases is called the 
Fig. 11.2: Waxing (Shukla Paksha) and waning period

waxing period. In India, the waning period of the Moon is generally 
called the Krishna Paksha, while the waxing period is called the 
Shukla Paksha. The Moon goes through a waning period followed by 
a waxing period in a cyclical manner as shown in Fig. 11.2. The cycle 
from one full Moon to the next takes about a month.
The changing shapes of the bright portion of the Moon from 
one day to another as seen from the Earth are called the phases 
of the Moon.
11.1.2 Locating the Moon
When you checked the Moon at the same time on successive 
days (for example, at sunrise), did you see it in a different part 
of the sky? On a full Moon day, the Moon is nearly opposite the 
Sun — when the Sun rises in the East, the Moon is almost setting 
in the West. On subsequent mornings at sunrise, as its bright 
part continues to decrease, the Moon appears to move closer in 
the sky to the Sun. When the bright part of the Moon decreases 
to a half circle shape, the Moon is overhead at Sunrise. A few 
days later, the crescent Moon appears even closer to the Sun. 
Knowing the phase of the Moon and whether it is waxing or 
waning can thus help us find out where and when to look for 
the Moon on any given day. A waxing Moon is easiest to spot at 
sunset, and a waning Moon at sunrise. Because of these shifts, 
the Moon always rises and sets at different times than the Sun.
A step further
Many people believe the Moon rises when the Sun sets, but that 
is not always true. Look in a local newspaper or on the Positional 
Astronomy Centre (India Meteorological Department) website to find 
the moonrise time in your area. Check these times for several days 
in a row and you will see that the Moon rises about 50 minutes later 
each day. Sometimes moonrise happens in the afternoon (around 
2:00 – 4:00 p.m.), so you can spot the Moon in the eastern sky during 
daylight. You may need to wait about 30 minutes past the listed 
moonrise time for the Moon to climb high enough for it to be seen.
The time and position of moonrise changes from one day to the next.

11.1.3 Making sense of our observations
The shape of the Moon itself does not change, only what 
we see changes. You may recall learning earlier that the 
Moon does not emit light of its own, but shines because it 
reflects sunlight that falls on it. The half of the Moon that 
faces the Sun receives sunlight and becomes illuminated 
(Fig. 11.3). The other half facing away from the Sun does 
not receive sunlight and remains non-illuminated.
The Moon revolves around the Earth and, only one 
half of the Moon always faces the Earth. However, the 
portion of the Moon facing the Earth is not always its 
illuminated part. We can only see the illuminated portion 
of the Moon from Earth. Sometimes, the entire illuminated portion 
of the Moon faces the Earth, and at other times only a part of it. 
At such times the illuminated portion of the Moon that we see is 
not a full circle. On New Moon day, we do not see the illuminated 
portion of the Moon at all, as only the non-illuminated portion of 
the Moon faces the Earth. Therefore, the Moon appears different 
on different days.
Let us do an activity to understand how the 
illuminated portion of the Moon, as seen by us, 
changes when its position changes with respect 
to the Sun.
Activity 11.2: Let us explore
	
z Take a small soft ball and insert a stick into it (Fig. 11.4a). 
This represents the Moon.
	
z Go to a dark open place (at night), and ask a teacher or 
guardian to shine a torchlight towards you from about 
3 m to represent light coming from the Sun or stand near an 
electric lamp. Your head represents the Earth.
	
z Now hold the ball at arm’s length in one hand such that it is 
slightly above your head as shown in Fig. 11.4b. Keep the ball at 
position E towards the direction of the lamp. Does the portion 
of the ball facing you appear to be illuminated or not?
	
z Turn around slowly, in the anti-clockwise direction, with your 
arm outstretched as shown in Fig. 11.4b and keep looking at 
the ball. Does the shape of the illuminated portion change? 
Is the line separating the illuminated and non-illuminated 
portions of the ball curved?
	
z Was your observation similar to the changing shape of the 
illuminated portion of ball shown in Fig. 11.4c? The shape of 
the illuminated portion of the ball, as seen by you, changes 
depending on where the ball is with respect to the lamp.

Moon; (c) The ball as seen by the student at different positions
When the ball is held opposite to the direction of the lamp 
(at A), you are facing the entire illuminated portion of the ball, 
just like the full Moon day. On the other hand, when the ball 
is held towards the direction of the lamp (at E), you are facing 
the non-illuminated portion of the ball, and cannot see the 
illuminated portion of the ball at all. This is similar to the new 
Moon day. Notice how in other cases, the line separating the 
illuminated and non-illuminated portions of the ball appears 
curved (Fig. 11.4c), similar to the shape of the illuminated portion 
of the Moon viewed from the Earth on other days.
Using our observations of Activity 11.2, let us now try to 
understand the phases of Moon. Fig. 11.5a shows the positions of 
the Moon corresponding to the different positions of the ball in 
Fig. 11.4b. Also shown are the Earth and the sunrays. As shown 
in Fig. 11.5a, the Moon revolves once around the Earth from 
position A to H and back to position A in about one month. The 
side of the Moon that faces the Sun is illuminated.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
The portion of the Moon that faces the Earth is marked by the 
orange dashed lines and arrows. The illuminated portion of only 
this part of the Moon can be seen from the Earth. At positions 
B and H, more than half of the illuminated portion, called the 
gibbous phase, can be seen. At positions D and F, less than half 
of the illuminated portion, called the crescent phase, can be 
seen. The change in the fraction of the illuminated portion of the 
Moon seen from Earth causes phases of the Moon. 
The phases that will be seen from the Earth at different 
positions of the Moon are shown in Fig. 11.5b. From A to C to E, 
we see the waning phase, and from E to G and back to A, we 
see the waxing phase. Since the rotation period of the Earth of 
one day is much smaller compared to the revolution period of 
the Moon which is nearly a month, on a given day, people on 
different parts of the Earth see nearly the same phase.
As can be seen in Fig. 11.5a, on the New Moon day, the Moon 
appears closest to the Sun and it appears farthest on the Full 
Moon day. Is this not what we also observed in Activity 11.1?

In Activity 11.1, we 
also observed that the 
position of the Moon 
at sunrise (or sunset) 
appeared to be shifted 
on 
successive 
days. 
This happens because, 
as shown in Fig. 11.6, 
the Moon moves ahead 
in its orbit while the 
Earth completes one 
rotation about its axis 
in 
24 
hours. 
Earth 
needs to rotate some 
more for the Moon to 
appear in nearly the 
same spot in the sky.
A step further
The Moon phases do not happen due to Earth’s shadow. It is an incorrect 
explanation for the Moon’s phases that Earth’s shadow falls on it. As we 
have learnt, the phases of the Moon occur due to the relative change in 
orientation of the Sun, Moon, and Earth as the Moon revolves around 
the Earth. The Earth’s shadow on the Moon causes a lunar eclipse, not 
the Moon’s phases as we learnt earlier (in chapter ‘Earth, Moon and the 
Sun’ in the Curiosity, Grade 7). 
Lunar eclipses can only happen on a full Moon day and solar eclipses 
can happen only on a new Moon day. But they do not occur every month 
because of the small tilt of the Moon’s orbit with respect to the Earth’s 
orbit around the Sun.

11.2 How Did Calendars Come into Existence?
We have learnt earlier that when viewed from the Earth, the Sun 
appears to rise in the eastward direction, set in the westward 
direction every day, and rise again the next day. This apparent 
periodic motion of the Sun seen by us is primarily due to the 
rotation of the Earth around its own axis. This natural cycle of 
the Sun due to the rotation of the Earth, is the foundation of the 
day, a unit to measure time.
The average time that the Sun takes to go from its highest 
position in the sky on one day to the highest position in the 
sky the next day, is 24 hours, and is called the mean solar 
day. The highest position of the Sun in the sky can be found by 
measuring the length of the shadows cast by an object during 
the day. The shadow is shortest when the Sun is at the highest 
point in the sky. 
Activity 11.3: Let us measure a day!
	
z Find a small flat area in a ground which receives sunlight 
during the day. Fix a 1 m stick vertically in it as shown in 
Fig. 11.7. 
	
z Start observing at 11:00 a.m. Every 
minute, mark a dot on the ground 
at the tip of the stick’s shadow. Keep 
marking dots until around 1:10 p.m.
	
z Identify when the shadow was 
shortest and find out its time by 
counting the number of dots. Record 
this time in Table 11.2. Repeat this 
exercise for the next few days.
	
z Find the duration of the solar day 
by finding a difference in time on 
two consecutive days as shown in 
Table 11.1.
So, changing phases of the 
Moon is a natural periodic 
event, with a cycle of almost 
a month, which can also be 
used for time keeping.
Yes, along with the natural periodic 
events of day and night and the 
changing seasons about which we 
learnt earlier. But how are these 
periodic events used for keeping time?

Table 11.2: Finding the duration of a solar day
Find the average duration of the day. Is it nearly equal to 
24 hours? 
The phases of the Moon give us 
another natural cycle with a duration 
that is longer than a day. The Moon 
takes about 29.5 days (nearly a month) 
to cycle through all its phases. The 
cycle of the phases of the Moon is the 
basis for a month, another unit to 
measure time (Fig. 11.8).
The next larger unit to measure 
time is related to the natural cycle of 
seasons. Do you remember learning 
earlier 
that 
the 
Earth 
revolves 
around the Sun and takes nearly 365 
and a quarter days to complete one 
revolution around the Sun? The Earth 
undergoes one cycle of seasons during 
this time, which can be used to define 
a solar year (Fig. 11.8).
11.2.1 Lunar calendars
In ancient times, people had noticed that during one cycle of 
seasons, one can fit nearly 12 cycles of the phases of the moon, 
that is, 12 lunar months. This is how lunar calendars came 
into being, with the day as the shortest unit, a month of nearly 
29.5 days, and a lunar year consisting of 12 lunar months. The 
phases of the Moon thus gave an easy and a perfectly sound way 
to track the passage of time.
However, in a lunar calendar the seasons do not remain 
synchronised to the same lunar months in successive lunar years. 
The reason is that the seasons repeat in approximately 365 days 
while the lunar year is 354 days long.
Fig. 11.8: The Earth goes around the Sun, and 
the Moon revolves around the Earth in regular 
intervals of time.

11.2.2 Solar calendars
It was important to know the arrival of seasons for agricultural 
purposes. This need for a year to synchronise with seasons led to 
the creation of solar calendars. The Gregorian calendar, widely 
used today, is a solar calendar. The months in solar calendars are 
adjusted to add up to 365 days. That is why in Gregorian calendars, 
some months have 30 days, others 31, and February has only 
28 days.
On top of the 365 days, the Earth takes nearly an extra quarter 
of a day to complete one revolution around the Sun. These extra 
hours add up to approximately one day every four years. To 
adjust for this, solar calendars add an extra day every four years 
using the concept of a leap year. In the Gregorian calendar, if a 
year is divisible by four, then an extra leap day is added. So in a 
leap year, February has 29 days, which keeps the calendar well 
synchronised with the seasons.
A step further
The Earth takes slightly less time than 365 and a quarter day to 
go from one spring equinox to the next spring equinox. Adding a 
day every four years helps to synchronise with the seasons, but 
it actually adds a little too much over time. To fix this, leap years 
are skipped every 100 years—like in 1700, 1800, and 1900. But 
skipping all of them would make the calendar lag slightly behind. 
So every 400 years, a leap year is again added back—like in 1600 
and 2000. These careful corrections keep the calendar closely 
matched with the seasons over long periods of time!
A step further
As we learnt earlier, seasons are caused by the Earth’s revolution 
around the Sun and its movement from the spring equinox to 
winter equinox and back. The time between successive spring 
equinoxes is called the tropical year. Gregorian calendar is based 
upon tropical year.
We have also learnt earlier that the stars that rise at sunset 
change throughout the year due to the Earth’s revolution around 
the Sun. The time duration required for the same stars to rise 
again at sunset is called the sidereal year, and it can also be used to 
define a solar calendar. The sidereal year is longer than the tropical 
year by a mere 20 minutes, and so it takes a long time before 
the differences between the two calendars become noticeable. 
In modern times, astronomers use the sidereal year to keep track of 
the Earth’s position in its orbit around the Sun.
Chapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies
11.2.3 Luni-solar calendars
There is another kind of calendar which primarily uses the Moon’s 
phases for counting days and months but also make adjustments 
to stay in sync with the cycle of seasons.
The 12 lunar months add up to 354 days and thus fall short by 
nearly 11 days compared to the solar year. Thus every 2–3 years, 
Our scientific heritage
For thousands of years, people — including those in India — have been 
observing the sky and developing calendars. People in ancient times did not 
know that Earth revolves around the Sun, and lacked modern instruments. 
Yet through years of careful sky observations, they noticed patterns and cycles 
in natural events. Hence, they could 
determine that the length of the year 
was approximately 365 days allowing 
them to create calendars. 
For example, careful observation 
reveals that the Sun does not always 
rise exactly in the East. In summer, 
it rises a little northward of East 
and in winter a little southward of 
East. These extremes happen on 
the solstices, around June 21 and 
December 21 each year. The Sun’s 
apparent northward movement from December to June is called Uttarayan, 
and its apparent southward movement from June to December is Dakshinayan. 
This cycle repeats every year and is closely linked to the changing seasons. The 
Taittirīya Saṁhitā records it in the verse 6.5.3:
तस्‍‍माादाादि�त्‍‍य: षण्माासाा दक्षिि±णेनैति� षडुत्तरेण ।
“Thus the Sun moves southwards for six months and northwards for six 
months.” 
In the past, the equinoxes and solstices were also tracked by identifying the 
stars that rose at sunset. Ancient Indian texts like the Surya Siddhanta noted 
that the pattern of stars, Capricorn (called Makar in India), would be in the 
background of the Sun around the winter solstice during those ancient times.
भाानोोर्मकरसंंस्‍ङ््क्राान्तेःः3 षण्माासाा उत्तराायणम्् ।
कर्क्‍का��ा�देस्तुु तथैव स्याात् षण्माासाा दक्षिि±णाायनम्् ।।9।। 
Translation: From the moment of the Sun’s entrance into the constellation 
of Capricorn, six months make up its northward progress (Uttarayana), so 
likewise from the moment of entrance into the constellation of Cancer, six 
months are its southward progress (Dakshinayana). 
Over the years, different types of calendars have evolved based on specific 
needs. A number of these calendars are used in different parts of India to track 
time and celebrating festivals.

the accumulated difference becomes close to a full month. 
Therefore, every few years, an extra month (called Adhika Maasa 
or intercalary month) is added to the year in some calendars. This 
keeps the solar year and the lunar cycle in step. Such calendars 
are called luni-solar calendars. They combine elements from 
both the solar and the lunar calendars and are used in many 
parts of India.
Ever heard of ...
You may have heard of the names (or similar sounding names) 
of the months in various Indian luni-solar calendars — Chaitra, 
Vaisakha, Jyeshtha, Ashadha, Shravana, Bhadrapada, Ashwin, Kartika, 
Margashirsha (or Agrahayan), Pausha, Magha, and Phalguna. In some 
communities, the new month starts on the first day after the new 
Moon and ends on the day of the new Moon. Such calendars are 
called Amant. In others, the start of the new month corresponds to 
the day after the full Moon, and the month ends on the full Moon. 
Such calendars are called Purnimant.

Fig. 11.9: Indian National Calendar 
It is a solar calendar (Fig. 11.9) consisting of 365 days in a year. 
The year begins on 22 March, which is the day after the spring 
equinox. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, months in the Indian 
National Calendar have either 30 or 31 days. The names of these 
months were taken from traditional Indian calendars. In a regular 
year, the second to sixth months have 31 days and the rest have 
30 days. The leap years are matched to the Gregorian calendar by 
adding a day to Chaitra, the first month of the year. In such years, 
the new year begins on 21 March of the Gregorian calendar.

In 1952, the Government of India set up a Calendar Reform 
Committee (CRC) to examine all existing calendars which were 
being followed in the country at that time and to recommend an 
accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India. The CRC 
recommended ‘Unified National Calendar’ was adopted for use 
with effect from 21 March 1956 CE, that is, 1 Chaitra 1878 Saka. 
The Indian National Calendar follows the general principles as that 
of the Surya Siddhanta.

as the Saha equation. The Saha Institute of Nuclear 
Physics, in Kolkata, is named after him. He was also 
the chairperson of the Calendar Reform Committee.
11.3 Are Festivals Related to Astronomical 
Phenomena?
Many Indian festivals are tied to the phases 
of the Moon and hence are based on either 
lunar or luni-solar calendars. For instance, 
Diwali falls on the new Moon of the month of 
Kartika, Holi on the full Moon of Phalguna, 
Buddha Purnima on the full Moon of Vaisakha, Eid-ul-Fitr is 
celebrated after sighting the crescent Moon at the end of the 
month of Ramazan, while Dussehra is celebrated on the tenth 
day in the month of Ashwina. Hence, they occur on different dates 
in the Gregorian calendar in successive years.
For festivals based on luni-solar calendars, the Gregorian 
calendar dates can shift, but this shift is typically less than 
a month. This is because the luni-solar calendars add the 
intercalary month every few years which correct for the 
difference between the lunar and the solar year. In contrast, 
purely lunar calendars do not account for this difference. 
Any festival celebrated according to the phases of the Moon, 
such as Eid-ul-fitr, therefore can occur in different months of 
the Gregorian calendar year after year.
Why do most Indian 
festivals fall on different 
dates every year?

A step further
A few festivals in India, like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bihu, Vaisakhi, 
Poila Baisakh, and Puthandu, follow a solar sidereal calendar. 
These festivals happen on almost the same date every year in the 
Gregorian calendar which is based on the tropical year.
A long time ago, these festivals were tied to either a solstice or 
an equinox. Due to the small difference in the sidereal and tropical 
years, the dates of these festivals slowly shift away from the 
solstices/equinoxes. This shift is due to slow wobble of the Earth’s 
axis, similar to the movement of the axis of a wobbling top. 
This causes the dates of festivals based on the sidereal calendar 
to move ahead in tropical calendar. For example, Makar Sankranti 
moves ahead by one day every 71 years.

The dates of many Indian festivals are based on the exact lunar 
phase at sunrise. As sunrise occurs earlier in Eastern India and 
later in Western India, these dates can also shift by a day between 
these regions even in the same year. To maintain uniformity 
throughout the country, the Positional Astronomy Center of the 
Government of India annually publishes the Rashtriya panchang, 
a detailed calculation of the positions of celestial objects, such as 
the Moon and the Sun for a central location in India. Based on 
these calculations, it provides an advance intimation on dates of 
festivals to Government of India for holiday declaration.

The Moon and moonlight have inspired ragas in Indian classical 
music. Chandrakauns, Chandranandan, and Shubhapantuvarali 
(which also means “auspicious moon”) are a few ragas that display 
the moon’s imagery in their names and melodic expressions. 
Similarly, mudras (hand gestures), for example, Chandrakala, and 
Ardhachandran relating to the Moon can be found in Indian classical 
dance Bharatanatyam.
The same is true for other dance forms — Kathak, Odissi, and 
Kuchipudi. 
Even 
the 
traditional painting styles: 
Madhubani, Warli, and other 
forms of art, such as sculpture 
and pottery among Saura, 
Gond and other tribes invoke 
depictions of the Moon and 
the Sun prominently implying 
their significance in daily life.

11.4 Why Do We Launch Artificial Satellites 
in Space?
The Moon is Earth’s natural satellite, orbiting 
our planet. Besides the Moon, man-made 
satellites sent by various countries also orbit 
the Earth. These artificial satellites appear as 
tiny specks moving in the night sky. Most orbit 
about 800 km above Earth’s surface and take 
roughly 100 minutes to complete one orbit.
These satellites help us in many ways like communication, 
navigation, weather monitoring, disaster management, and 
scientific research. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 
has launched many satellites that support these activities.
The Cartosat series of satellites, launched by ISRO, capture high-quality 
images of the Earth to improve maps, plan cities, and handle natural 
disasters in India. One such mapping platform, Bhuvan, uses these 
images to show terrain, soil, land use, vegetation, and more.
AstroSat, another ISRO mission, makes scientific observations of 
stars and other celestial objects. India’s other space missions include 
Chandrayaan 1, 2, and 3 to the Moon; Aditya L1 to study the Sun; and 
Mangalyaan to Mars. ISRO also lets Indian students build and launch 
small satellites, such as AzaadiSat, InspireSat-1, and Jugnu.

Activity 11.4: Let us identify
	
z Spotting an artificial satellite is a night sky watching activity 
like we have done previously. Just before sunrise or after 
sunset, go to a location, accompanied by an adult, that has 
a clear view of the sky, without any obstruction of trees or 
tall buildings.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
	
z To identify satellites in the sky, look for any moving object 
in the sky that appears as a point of light with steady or 
flickering brightness and is moving very fast across the sky. 
You can see them with the naked eye or with binoculars.
	
z You may use mobile apps or websites that provide details 
of satellites visible in your location and when they will be 
passing above you in the sky.
A step further
A lot of artificial satellites are being sent up in space by many 
countries. After their useful life, many of them and their rocket 
parts become space junk or space debris. This debris crowds space, 
and could collide with working satellites. While small debris burns 
up in the atmosphere when it falls towards the Earth, the larger 
pieces can crash on ground. Countries are now working together to 
remove this dangerous debris.

The illuminated part of the Moon changes its shape from day to 
day through phases, like the new Moon, crescent, and full Moon.
	

The phases of the Moon happen because we see different parts of 
the illuminated portion of the Moon as it moves around the Earth.
	

A full cycle of phases of the Moon takes about a month.
	

The various cycles observed in nature resulted in the creation of 
calendars.

Lunar calendars follow the Moon’s cycle, while solar calendars 
follow the cycle of seasons, which depend upon the position of 
the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. Luni-solar calendars adapt 
to both the cycles.

Artificial satellites are human-made which are launched from the 
Earth. They provide important information for our well-being 
and space-science studies.

z The Moon’s crescent always faces towards the Sun (Fig. 11.12). 
On days when you see the crescent Moon, point your finger 
towards the Sun, and slowly move it across the sky towards 
the Moon taking as short a path as you can. Note how your 
finger always crosses the illuminated part of the Moon first 
and clearly shows us that we see sunlight reflected off the 
Moon. The line joining the tips of the crescent would 
correspond to the diameter of the Moon.

z Collect Gregorian calendars (the regular calendar you use 
every day) for the last five years with the help of your family 
members or teachers or the internet. For each year, look for 
the dates on which the festivals Eid-ul-Fitr and Diwali were 
celebrated and list them year wise in a tabular form. Do you 
notice that the date of Eid-ul-Fitr moves earlier each year — 
by about 11 days? If you have a corresponding lunar calendar 
at home or on the internet, check that the month and the 
day for Eid-ul-Fitr according to the lunar calendar remains 
the same. Does Diwali follow the same steady pattern, or 
are there some sudden jumps? Based on your chart, try to 
guess which year might have included an intercalary month 
(Adhikamaasa). Obtain a luni-solar calendar and confirm if 
there is an intercalary month between Diwali in the previous 
year and that year.
	
z Every morning on your way to school, notice the direction in 
which the Sun rises. Decide on a spot and look towards east, 
with trees, poles, or buildings acting as markers. Sketch the 
eastern horizon in your notebook. For the next one year, at 
the start of each month, stand at the same spot and mark the 
Sun’s position on your sketch. Label it with the name of the 
month. At the end of the year analyse your sketch. Do you 
find that the positions of sunrise shift in particular direction? 
Can you identify it with the Uttarayaan and Dakshinayaan 
that our ancestors noticed? (Refer the ‘A step further’ box on 
page 181).

If you visit a place near the sea, you may notice that water levels 
rise and fall. The rise and fall of water levels are called tides. Tides 
also follow a regular pattern. If there’s a low or a high tide at a 
certain time on one day, a similar tide will come about 50 minutes 
later the next day. We also learnt that the Moon also rises about 
50 minutes later each day. Careful observations show that tide 
levels are closely related to the Moon’s position and phase.
