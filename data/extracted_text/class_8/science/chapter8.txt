Chapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures
Have you ever wondered what the world around you is made 
of? Look around! The staircase you use, the air you breathe, the 
water in your bottle, the food in your lunch box, the clothes and 
shoes you wear, the book you read, the trees outside, the ball you 
play with and even the stick you carry — all of these are examples 
of matter, which you have learnt in earlier grades. 
You have also learnt that all these things are made up of tiny 
particles. Most of the things around us are not made of just one 
substance; rather they are made up of two or more substances 
mixed together. Let us now understand how different substances 
come together to form mixtures.
8.1 What Are Mixtures?
Have you ever wondered what makes 
your poha (Fig. 8.1) so delicious or how 
to make the perfect sprout salad? While 
these dishes may seem very different, they 
share something in common—they are 
both made by mixing several ingredients. 
We observe the mixing of substances in 
everyday life. Sugar dissolved in water 
is also a mixture, and so are soups and 
lemonade. 
When two or more substances are 
mixed, where each substance retains 
its properties, it is called a mixture. 
The individual substances that make up 
a mixture are called its components. 
The components of a mixture do not 
react chemically with each other. In some 
mixtures, the components — like green 
gram, chickpeas, onion, and tomato 
in a sprout salad (Fig. 8.2), are easy to 
see. Such mixtures, where the different 
components are generally visible with the naked eye or with a 
magnifying device, are non-uniform in nature. Can you identify 
a few more examples of non-uniform mixtures around you?
On the other hand, some mixtures have components that 
cannot be seen separately even with the help of a microscope. 
For example, sugar and water particles cannot be seen separately 
in their mixture. Such types of mixtures, where the components 
are evenly distributed and cannot be distinguished, are uniform 
in nature (Fig. 8.3). Can you list a few uniform mixtures?

Fig. 8.2: Sprout salad

Mishraloha was the name given to the mixture of two or more metals 
that had properties distinct from its constituent metals. Ancient 
Indian texts, such as the Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Rasaratna 
Samucchaya, Rasa Jala Nidhi, etc., mention the use of alloys for 
medicinal purposes. For example, Bronze, also known as Kamsya, is 
an alloy made up of Copper (Tamra, 4 parts) and Tin (Vanga, 1 part), 
was used to improve digestion and boost immunity.
Our scientific heritage
8.1.1 Is air a mixture?
In Curiosity, Grade 6, you learnt about air and its composition in 
the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’. Is air a mixture? What kind of 
mixture is it? 
You have learnt that air is a uniform mixture of mainly 
nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapour. Out of 
these, oxygen is required by most of the living beings to stay alive. 
It also helps in combustion. Nitrogen, which constitutes about 78% 
of the air, does not take part in combustion. We also learnt that air 
has water vapour in it. When warm air touches a cool surface, the 
water vapour turns into liquid water, forming tiny droplets. Recall 
the experiment where you tested the presence of carbon dioxide 
in the air that we exhale. Let us confirm the presence of carbon 
dioxide in the air.
Activity 8.1: Let us experiment
	
z Take a glass tumbler and fill it half with water.
	
z Add a small amount of calcium oxide 
(quick lime) slowly to it.
	
z What do you observe?
	
z Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with 
water to form calcium hydroxide and releases heat. 
Safety first
Perform this step carefully.
A step further
Do you know that stainless steel is also a mixture? 
Stainless steel contains iron, nickel, chromium, 
and a small amount of carbon. They are mixed 
so uniformly that the entire mixture appears 
the same throughout and one cannot see the 
individual substances. Such mixtures are known 
as alloys. Brass, a mixture of copper and zinc, 
and bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, are 
some other examples of alloys (Fig. 8.4).
Fig. 8.4: Utensils made of 
stainless steel, brass, and bronze
Chapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures
	
z Stir continuously to make a solution of calcium 
hydroxide. This solution is called lime water.
	
z Filter it and observe its colour.
	
z Leave this colourless solution in a petri dish for a few 
hours (Fig. 8.5a).
	
z Keep stirring the solution at regular intervals.
	
z What do you observe (Fig. 8.5b)? 
	
z Does it turn milky? 
Can you explain why the solution has turned milky?
You know that lime water turns milky when carbon 
dioxide reacts with calcium hydroxide to form calcium 
carbonate (insoluble tiny white particles) and water 
(Fig. 8.5). Since lime water turns milky when exposed to 
air, this activity demonstrates the presence of carbon 
dioxide in the air. 
Calcium hydroxide + Carbon dioxide 
 Calcium carbonate + Water
Apart from gases, have you ever observed anything 
else present in the air? Have you ever noticed tiny shining 
particles moving in a beam of sunlight entering a dark room 
through a small opening? What are these particles? 
Activity 8.2: Let us explore
	
z Take a black sheet of paper. Ensure that it is free from 
any visible dust particles.
	
z Place the black sheet of paper undisturbed near an open 
window (Fig. 8.6a), or in the garden, for a few hours.
	
z What do you observe?
You may notice tiny particles settled on its surface. You 
may use a magnifying glass to examine the particles more 
closely (Fig. 8.6b).
This shows that dust particles are suspended in the air. 
They are not an integral part of the air and are considered 
pollutants. The nature and the number of dust particles in 
the air may vary from time to time and from place to place.
A step further
The major pollutants present in the air are particulate matter 
(dust, soot) and gases like carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen 
dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The air quality index (AQI) is a 
tool used to describe the air quality.

8.1.2 Types of mixtures
You know that the term ‘mixture’ in common usage refers to the 
mixing of two or more components. The components of a mixture 
may themselves be mixtures, as in poha and sprout salad, or 
pure substances like sugar or common salt dissolved in water. 
However, in science, all the components of a mixture must be 
pure substances only.
Mixtures could be of several types depending on the physical 
state of their components. Some mixtures with their examples are 
shown in Table 8.1. Complete the third column—

Table 8.1: Different types of mixtures
You learnt in earlier grades about the separation of mixtures. It 
is done to separate the components of a mixture. The examples 
discussed were from everyday life, where separation is done 
to obtain the component of interest and other components are 
discarded. However, in science, the purpose of separating a 
mixture is to obtain pure substances.
8.2 What Are Pure Substances?
Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’ written on the packs of 
some consumables, such as milk, ghee, and spices (Fig. 8.7)? The 
word ‘pure’ has slightly different meanings in common usage 
and in science.
In common usage, ‘pure’ means unadulterated products. 
Adulteration is an illegal process of adding substances which 
are cheaper, or of a poor quality, to a product. This is usually 
done to increase the quantity or reduce the manufacturing cost. 
However, it deteriorates the quality of the product. It can also 
make the product hazardous to health. 
 Fig. 8.7: Some 
consumable items
Chapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures
In science, however, a pure substance is the one that has no 
other substance present in it. For a scientist, even these products 
that look pure can be considered impure if they are made of 
more than one substance.
A pure substance is a kind of matter that cannot be separated 
into other kinds of matter by any physical process. When a 
scientist says that something is pure, it means that the substance 
consists of the same type of particles.
A step further
According to science, how would you classify milk, packed 
fruit juice, baking soda, sugar, and soil — as mixtures or pure 
substances?
8.3 What Are the Types of Pure Substances?
Recall the different states of water that you studied in Curiosity, 
Grade  6. What happened when water was cooled or heated? 
We observed that on cooling water gets converted into ice, and 
on boiling it gets converted into vapour. We can get back water 
up on heating ice or cooling water vapour. It shows that during 
these processes, the particles of water remain the same. Now, let 
us perform another activity in which we pass electricity through 
water and observe its effect. 
Activity 8.3: Let us experiment

gases be water vapour?
	
z Wait for a few minutes.
	
z Do you observe the formation of any gas bubbles 
at both the terminals inside the test tubes?
	
z Let it continue for 10–15 minutes.
	
z Observe the volume of gas collected in each test 
tube (Fig. 8.8d).
	
z Is the volume of the gas collected the same in 
both the test tubes? 
	
z Remove these test tubes one-by-one carefully. 
	
z Test these gases one-by-one by bringing a 
burning candle close to the mouth of the test 
tubes. 
	
z What happens in each case? 
	
z Which gas is present in each test tube?
To test the gases present in the two test tubes, bring a burning 
candle near the mouth of each test tube. A pop sound can be heard 
from one, indicating the presence of hydrogen gas (Fig. 8.9a). In the 
other test tube, the flame of the burning candle will glow brighter, 
confirming the presence of oxygen gas (Fig. 8.9b).

From Activity 8.3, we can infer that water is composed of two 
different constituents—hydrogen and oxygen.
Water 
 Hydrogen + Oxygen￼
8.3.1 Elements
The two substances hydrogen and oxygen formed in Activity 8.3, 
are pure substances and are termed as elements. Each element 
is made up of identical particles called atoms. These particles 
are different from the particles of any other element. Elements 
are substances that cannot be further broken down into simpler 
substances. They are the building blocks of all matter. Some other 
examples of elements are gold, silver, sulfur, carbon, etc. 
The atoms of most of the elements cannot exist 
independently. Two or more such atoms combine and 
form a stable particle of that element called a molecule. 
For example, two atoms of hydrogen combine to form 
one molecule of hydrogen. Similarly, two atoms of oxygen 
combine to form one molecule of oxygen (Fig. 8.10).
A step further
Elements can be classified into metals and non-metals. 
You have already studied that gold, silver, magnesium, iron, and 
aluminium are metals, whereas carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, and 
oxygen are non-metals. Isn't it interesting to know that some 
elements like silicon and boron have intermediate properties 
between those of metals and non-metals? They are called 
metalloids, about which you will learn in higher grades. 
	

The number of elements known at present is 118, and most of them exist 
in a solid state.
	

Eleven elements exist in a gaseous state at room temperature, all of 
which are non-metals like oxygen, helium, nitrogen, etc.
	

Only two elements are liquid at room temperature—mercury, which is a 
metal and bromine, which is a non-metal. 
	

Although gallium and caesium are solid elements, they become liquid at 
a temperature around 30 °C (303 K) and turn into liquid.
A step further
Ever heard of ...
When electric current is passed through water, it breaks down into 
hydrogen and oxygen. Is this a chemical change or a physical change? 
Recall Curiosity, Grade 7, chapter ‘Changes Around Us: Physical and 
Chemical’.

8.3.2 Compounds
Why cannot we separate hydrogen and oxygen present 
in water by physical means?
In water, the particles of hydrogen and oxygen are 
so tightly attached to each other that it is generally 
impossible to separate them apart using physical 
methods. That is why water is a compound. Compounds 
are formed when different elements combine in fixed 
ratios to form something entirely new. 
The properties of compounds are different 
from those of elements forming that 
compound. The constituent elements of 
a compound cannot be separated by any 
physical method. From  Activity 8.3, we 
find that molecules of water are made of two different elements: 
hydrogen and oxygen (Fig. 8.11), combined chemically in a fixed 
ratio. The ratio of the number of atoms of hydrogen to oxygen in 
water has been found to be 2:1.
Are common salt and sugar elements or compounds? Let us 
find out.
Sodium, a soft metal, and chlorine, a hazardous gas, combine 
to form a harmless yet taste-enhancing substance that is essential 
for our lives. This substance is known as sodium chloride, which 
is made up of particles of sodium and chlorine in a 1:1 ratio. We 
learnt that dissolved sodium chloride (common salt) may be 
separated from water by the physical process of evaporation.
Is it possible to separate sodium chloride into its elements by 
physical processes? 
Let us now explore if we can separate the elements in sugar!
Activity 8.4: Let us experiment
	
z Put a teaspoon of sugar in a boiling tube. 
	
z Heat it gently as shown in Fig. 8.12a.
	
z What do you observe?
Oh!

is

fascinating—hydrogen 
is 
a fuel, oxygen supports 
combustion, 
whereas 
water extinguishes fire.

More than 45 different elements, like aluminium, copper, silicon, 
cobalt, lithium, gold, silver, etc., are used in manufacturing a mobile

Fig. 8.11: Depiction of

Chapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures
As you heat the sugar, it turns brown 
(Fig. 8.12b). Later, it begins to char, i.e., it 
turns blackish (Fig. 8.12c). 
You will find small droplets of water 
inside the boiling tube near its open end. 
Where did this water come from? Was 
it in the dry sugar, or did it come by the 
condensation of water vapour in the air?
Since we are heating the tube, the 
water must have come from the dry sugar 
and not from the air. Can you predict 
what is left behind? Charcoal (carbon) is 
left behind in the boiling tube. You can 
scoop it out in a watch glass (Fig. 8.12c) 
and explore if it burns like coal.
Sugar decomposes on heating and 
gives carbon and water. As you know, 
water consists of hydrogen and oxygen. 
Hence, sugar cannot be an element. 
It may be stated that sugar is a chemical 
compound consisting of the elements 
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

Some discussion points
	
z Do the Samples, A and B look the same?
	
z Which sample exhibits magnetic properties?
	
z Can we separate the components of Samples A and B?
	
z On adding dilute hydrochloric acid, do gases evolve in both 
Samples A and B? 
	
z In both the cases, do the gases smell the same or different?
	
z Also, categorise the substances used in this activity into 
mixtures, compounds, and elements.
Sample A: We can say that Sample A is a mixture of the two 
elements—iron and sulfur. Its components retain their properties, 
and their black and yellow coloured particles can be seen. 
On bringing magnet near Sample A, the iron filings get attracted 
towards the magnet. Hence, iron and sulfur can be separated.
You might have observed that in Sample A, iron in the mixture 
reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form iron chloride and 
hydrogen gas. The gas is colourless, has no smell, and burns with 
a ‘pop’ sound.
The reaction can be represented as —
Iron + Dilute Hydrochloric acid 
 Iron chloride + Hydrogen gas
Sulfur on the other hand, is left as a yellow solid at the bottom 
of the test tube. This shows that sulfur does not react with 
hydrochloric acid.￼
Sample B: The black mass obtained in Sample B is iron sulfide. 
We observe that the texture and the colour are the same throughout. 
It is formed by heating the two elements, iron and sulfur. It is not 
attracted by a magnet. The new substance has completely different 
properties, and iron and sulfur can no longer be separated. Hence, 
we can say that a compound has been formed. Can you explain 
now why the magnet has no effect on Sample B?
Also, Sample B, iron sulfide, reacts with dilute hydrochloric 
acid, to form iron chloride and hydrogen sulfide gas. The gas is 
colourless and has a rotten egg-like odour. 
The reaction can be represented as —
Sample A
Sample B
Iron sulfide + Dilute Hydrochloric acid 
 Iron chloride + Hydrogen sulfide
8.4 How Do We Use Elements, Compounds, 
and Mixtures?
Elements, compounds, and mixtures are all around us. The 
air we breathe is a mixture of gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and 
carbon dioxide. Water, which is essential for life, is a compound 
Chapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures
made of elements, hydrogen and oxygen. Elements like iron and 
aluminium are used to construct bridges, buildings, and vehicles.
Understanding these concepts is not just about recognising 
what surrounds us; it is also the key to innovation. For instance, 
chemists study how elements combine to create compounds, 
enabling them to invent life-saving medicines and vaccines to fight 
diseases. This knowledge also helps in the creation of fertilisers 
thereby enhancing crop production that feeds the ever-increasing 
human population globally.
Engineers and material scientists rely on their understanding of 
compounds and mixtures to design materials with unique properties. 
For example, they have developed alloys like stainless steel, which is 
stronger and more durable than pure iron. Wood, steel, and concrete, 
which are used as building materials, are all mixtures.
You learnt that various metals are obtained from minerals. 
Let us learn about these minerals.
An 
example 
of 
a 
‘wonder’ 
material 
developed by material scientists is graphene 
aerogel. This is made from carbon and is 
said to be the lightest material on earth. It is 
so light that even grass can hold it (Fig. 8.21). 
It is highly porous and therefore, has a high 
absorbing capacity. For this reason, it can 
potentially be used as an environmental cleaner, for example, to 
clean up oil spills in both seas and on land. It is useful in fabricating 
energy-saving devices and special coatings for buildings.

8.5 What Are Minerals?
Most rocks are a mixture of minerals, which can be 
viewed with the eyes, or by using a magnifying glass or 
a microscope. Some of the minerals are called native 
minerals, which are pure elements and not compounds. 
These can be metals, such as gold, silver, copper, etc., or 
non-metals like sulfur, carbon, etc. 
Most of the minerals are compounds made up of more 
than one element. Some common examples of minerals 
include quartz, calcite, mica, pyroxene, and olivine 
(Fig. 8.22). Many things that we use in our everyday life are 
made up of minerals or elements extracted from minerals. 
For example, cement is made from calcite, quartz, alumina, 
and iron oxide, which are minerals or are obtained from 
minerals. Talcum powder is made from the mineral talc.

Elements and compounds are the building blocks of 
matter—everything that has mass and takes up space. They make 
the materials we see and use every day. However, not everything 
around us is matter. Light, heat, electricity, and even thoughts 
and emotions are important parts of our world, but they are not 
made of matter. Understanding what matter is—and what it is 
not—helps us better understand the world around us.
Use 
of 
elements, 
compounds, 
and 
mixtures in Indian Art
The Dhokra art is an old craft from Bihar and 
Odisha that uses different metals to create 
beautiful figures inspired by nature (Fig. 8.23). 
The process begins with shaping a design in 
beeswax. This wax model is covered with clay 
to make a mould. After the clay hardens, the 
wax is melted out, leaving a hollow space. This 
space is then filled with molten brass or bronze 
which makes Dhokra art strong and gives it a 
shiny golden colour. The figures often show 
animals, people, and nature, reflecting tribal 
creativity and tradition.

A pure substance consists the same type of particles. All the constituent 
particles of that substance behave identically.
	

Pure substance can be either an element or a compound. 
	

Elements are the simplest substances that cannot be broken down further 
into simpler substances. They are the building blocks of all matter. 
	

Substances which are composed of two or more elements combined 
chemically in a fixed ratio and have different properties from their 
constituent elements are called compounds.
	

Minerals are natural, solid substances found on the Earth. They have a 
fixed chemical composition. Most often they are compounds but rarely, 
they can also be pure elements.

Keep the curiosity alive
1.	 Consider the following reaction where two substances, 
A and B, combine to form a product C:
A + B 
 C
Assume that A and B cannot be broken down into simpler 
substances by chemical reactions. Based on this information, 
which of the following statements is correct?
(i)	 A, B, and C are all compounds and only C has a fixed 
composition. 
(ii)	 C is a compound, and A and B have a fixed composition.
(iii)	 A and B are compounds, and C has a fixed composition.
(iv)	 A and B are elements, C is a compound, and has a fixed 
composition.
2.	 Assertion: Air is a mixture.
Reason: A mixture is formed when two or more substances 
are mixed, without undergoing any chemical change.
(i)	 Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the 
correct explanation for Assertion.
(ii)	 Both Assertion and Reason are true, but Reason is not 
the correct explanation for Assertion.
(iii)	 Assertion is true, but Reason is false.
(iv)	 Assertion is false, but Reason is true.
3.	 Water, a compound, has different properties compared to 
those of the elements oxygen and hydrogen from which it is 
formed. Justify this statement.
4.	 In which of the following cases are all the examples correctly 
matched? Give reasons in support of your answers.
(i)	 Elements — water, nitrogen, iron, air.
(ii)	 Uniform mixtures— minerals, seawater, bronze, air.
(iii)	 Pure substances— carbon dioxide, iron, oxygen, sugar.
(iv)	 Non-uniform mixtures — air, sand, brass, muddy water.
5.	 Iron reacts with moist air to form iron oxide, and magnesium 
burns in oxygen to form magnesium oxide. Classify all the 
substances involved in the above reactions as elements, 
compounds or mixtures, with justification.

Discover, design, and debate
	
z Design and create comic strips from real-life examples to 
differentiate between elements, compounds, and mixtures 
with diagrams and illustrate their properties and uses. 
	
z Search for discoveries of some elements (such as phosphorus, 
sodium), compounds (such as penicillin) and mixtures 
(such as brass, bronze, stainless steel). Present your findings 
in the class.
	
z Let us search: Read labels on items like detergents or snacks, 
and try to list the mixtures and compounds they contain.
	
z Work in groups: Each group will pretend to be in the role of 
either an element, a compound, or a mixture. Debate which 
category among them is the most important.
