3.1 Health: Is It More Than Not Falling Sick?
What do the news clippings on the notice board tell you about 
people’s health in our country? Is being healthy just about not 
having diseases? Health also includes feeling good physically, 
staying positive, and having strong relationships. A healthy person 
takes care of their body, maintains a positive mindset, and enjoys 
social life. Let us now explore what it truly means to be healthy.
Activity 3.1:  Let us read
A Grade 8 student moved to a new school in another city. With no 
friends in his new environment and busy parents, he felt lonely. To 
cope, he spent more time on his phone and social media, but this made 
him feel worse. He stopped trying to make friends, had headaches, 
lost weight, and could not sleep well. A doctor advised less screen 
time and meeting a counsellor. The school counsellor arranged help 
to support him in making friends and improving his health.
Think and Reflect: What was the cause of the boy’s health problems? 
How did his habits and surroundings affect his well-being?
As per the World Health Organization (WHO), health is 
defined as a ‘state of complete physical, mental, and social 
well-being, and not merely the absence of disease’ (Fig. 3.1). A 
healthy person can perform various tasks more efficiently and 
cope well in different and difficult situations. A healthy person 
can adjust well with peer groups and other members of society. 
Let us understand more about health.
Ayurveda teaches us that true health is a balance of body, mind, and 
surroundings.
Following 
dinacharya 
(daily 
routine) 
and 
ritucharya (seasonal routine) helps maintain this 
balance. Eating fresh, wholesome food suited to 
one’s prakriti (body constitution) is essential. 
Regular exercise, cleanliness, restful sleep, and 
a calm mind support overall well-being. This 
can also be achieved through practices like yoga, 
meditation, and mindfulness.

3.2 How Can We Stay Healthy?
Staying healthy means eating nutritious food, maintaining 
hygiene, staying in a clean place, exercising regularly, getting

Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
proper sleep, spending time with family and friends, and having 
a positive attitude. What we should do and what should not do to 
keep ourselves healthy?
Activity 3.2:  Let us list
	
z List some good habits that your parents, teachers, or elders 
often encourage you to follow. How many of these are already 
a part of your daily routine? Which ones would you like to 
start following? Add to the list below:
	
{
Keep yourself clean and maintain personal hygiene.
	
{
Eat a healthy and balanced diet.
	
{
Exercise regularly.
	
{
Make time to relax or meditate every day.
	
z Now, think about habits that are not good for your health. 
Add more to the list below:
	
{
Spending too much time on mobile phones or other digital 
screens.
	
{
Eating fast food and other junk food every day.
	
{
Sleeping very late or not getting enough sleep.
	
{
Skipping meals, especially breakfast.
Taking care of our body and mind is important. Healthy habits 
support a healthy body as well as a healthy mind. 
Discuss your findings with your friends and teacher. From 
the activity you participated in and the discussions, you may 
have realised that our health depends on many factors. These 
factors include our lifestyle (how we live) and our environment 
(our surroundings).
3.2.1 Maintain a healthy lifestyle
	
z Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and 
whole grains.
	
z Avoid processed, fatty, or sugary food and drinks.
	
z Stay physically active by playing outdoors, walking, running, 
cycling, or exercising.
	
z Limit screen time and spend more time in nature.  
	
z Get enough sleep to help your body and mind rest and recover.
	
z Practice yoga or simple breathing exercises like pranayama 
regularly.
	
z Say ‘NO’ to harmful substances things like tobacco, alcohol, 
and addictive drugs (Fig. 3.2).

3.2.2 Keep the environment clean
Activity 3.3: Let us compare
	
z Look at Fig. 3.3a and Fig. 3.3b.  Which playground would you 
like to play in, and why?  
	
z Most of us would like to play in the 
playground shown in Fig. 3.3a as it is clean, 
well-maintained, and looks beautiful. The 
playground in Fig. 3.3b is polluted, dirty, 
unhygienic, and full of flies and mosquitoes. 
People living in such areas may fall sick 
more often. 
	
z In addition to inculcating good habits and 
adopting a healthy lifestyle, we must keep 
ourselves and our surroundings clean.  
	
z Have you ever found it hard to breathe in 
a place with a lot of smoke or dust? That is 
because clean air and water are important 
for our health. In cities, air pollution from 
vehicles and factories can cause problems 
like coughing or asthma. The Air Quality 
Index (AQI) helps us know how clean the 
air is. A cleaner environment helps us stay 
healthy and feel better.
	
z But health is not only about the body. 
Our feelings and relationships matter too. 
Even if we eat well and live in a clean place, 
we may not feel good if we are lonely or upset. Spending 
time with friends and family, talking, laughing, and having 
fun help keep our minds healthy too.
3.3 How Do We Know That We Are Unwell?
Our body usually works in a certain way to keep us healthy. 
When we feel unwell, it means something inside us may not 
be working as it should. We may have symptoms, such as pain, 
tiredness, or dizziness, and signs like fever, rash, high blood 
pressure, or swelling that indicate we are unwell. A symptom 
is what we feel (like pain), while a sign is something that can be 
seen or measured (like high body temperature when we have 
fever). These help doctors understand what might be making us 
unwell.

3.4 Diseases: What Are the Causes and Types?
A disease is a condition that affects the normal working of the 
body or mind. It can happen when one or more organs or organ 
systems stop functioning properly. Some diseases are caused by 
germs like bacteria, viruses, fungi, worms, or even by protozoa 
(single-celled organisms). These disease-causing organisms are 
called pathogens. Other diseases may result from poor nutrition 
or an unhealthy lifestyle. Some diseases last for a short time, while 
others can continue for a long time and need regular treatment 
or care. Diseases can be grouped into two major types based on 
their causes and how they spread:
	
z Non-communicable 
diseases— Some diseases, like 
cancer, diabetes, or asthma, 
are not caused by pathogens 
and do not spread from one 
person to another. They are 
usually linked to lifestyle, diet, 
and/or environment.
	
z Communicable diseases— 
Diseases caused by pathogens 
are called communicable 
diseases. They can spread 
from one person to 
another. Some examples 
of communicable diseases 
are typhoid, dengue, flu, 
chickenpox, and COVID-19. 
In recent years, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like 
diabetes, heart disease, and cancer have become more common 
in India. This is happening because of changes in how people 
live — such as eating more processed food, getting less exercise, 
and living longer lives. Today, most deaths in India are caused 
by NCDs. Understanding the difference between these two types 
helps us know how diseases spread and how to prevent them.
3.4.1 How are communicable diseases caused and spread?
All communicable diseases are caused by pathogens. These 
pathogens can enter our body through the air we breathe or by 
consuming contaminated food or water and more. But how do 
these pathogens spread from one person to another? One common 
way is through air, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or 
through direct contact like shaking hands, or indirectly by sharing

personal items of an infected person. Some of the communicable 
diseases spread through contaminated drinking water or food. 
Some pathogens are also spread by insects like mosquitoes and 
houseflies — these insects are called vectors (Fig. 3.4).
By understanding how diseases spread, we can take simple 
steps to protect ourselves and others. Let us find out how these 
communicable diseases spread and how we can prevent them.
Activity 3.4: Let us find out

By studying the Table 3.1, we can understand how infectious 
diseases spread and how to prevent them. Here are some simple 
but important precautions:
	
z Keeping ourselves and our surroundings clean.
	
z Practising basic hygiene every day.
	
z Washing hands with soap and water to remove pathogens. 
	
z Covering our mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing.
	
z Wearing a mask in crowded places provides protection.
	
z Avoid sharing of personal items like towels 
and handkerchiefs.
	
z Keeping our home, food, and water clean.
	
z Staying at home and resting when we are unwell helps the 
body recover and minimises spreading the disease to others.
Some infectious diseases are caused by worms that live inside 
our bodies, especially in the digestive system. They feed on nutrients 
and live as parasites — organisms that live in or on another living 
being. These worms usually spread through contaminated food, 
water, soil, or contact with infected people or animals.
3.4.2 How are non-communicable diseases caused? 
You learnt that non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, 
and asthma are linked to lifestyle, diet, and/or environment. 
They are the most common cause of death in India. In Grade 6, 
you also learnt about diseases like scurvy, anaemia, and goitre, 
Are diseases always 
caused by infections?
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
which are caused by a lack of specific nutrients 
in the diet. These are called deficiency diseases 
and are also non-communicable.
Diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and asthma may often persist 
for a long time (more than 3 months) and are referred to as 
chronic diseases. 
Diabetes is a common disease which is becoming more 
prevalent in adults as well as children. In fact, India now has 
one of the highest numbers of people with diabetes in the world. 
It often develops due to a combination of hormonal imbalances, 
unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity,  being overweight 
or obese, and other reasons.
Let us learn more about the causes of non-communicable 
diseases and their prevention.

biomedical researcher. She studied how hormones 
and certain viruses are linked to cancer, helping 
improve its treatment and prevention. Her work 
also showed how tobacco, diet, and pollution can 
raise the risk of cancer, highlighting the importance 
of a healthy lifestyle.
3.5 How to Prevent and Control Diseases?
You might have heard the phrase ‘Prevention is better than cure.’ 
It is important to protect ourselves from both communicable and 
non-communicable diseases.
Activity 3.6: Let us read
Odisha — community-led sanitation campaign
In Bhadrak district, Odisha, a community sanitation campaign 
helped more people build and use toilets. This reduced open 
defecation significantly, and improved child health, with fewer 
cases of diarrhoea and infections.
What do you infer from this case study? Simple steps like good 
sanitation can greatly reduce the spread of communicable diseases. 
Find about such community campaigns held in your location. Share 
in your class and discuss with your peers about the impact of such 
initiatives. 
Ability of the body to fight diseases 
You would have noticed that some people get sick more frequently 
than others, although living in a similar environment. Do you 
know why? The natural ability of our body to fight diseases is 
known as immunity. Our body has a special system called the 
immune system that helps fight against diseases. 
You might have taken some drops or injections in your 
childhood to protect yourself from certain diseases, such as 
polio, measles, tetanus, and hepatitis. These are vaccines that 
help prevent serious infections caused by viruses and bacteria. 
A vaccine helps our body fight certain diseases by training 
the immune system to recognise and attack harmful germs. 
providing what is known as acquired immunity — protection 
developed after exposure to a pathogen or a vaccine. Vaccines can 
be made in different ways — from weakened or dead pathogens 
(like viruses or bacteria), or from inactive or harmless parts of 
the pathogen. Some newer vaccines instruct our own body cells 
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
to make a harmless part of the germ, which our immune system 
then learns to fight.
For example, a tetanus shot, often given after an injury 
protects against infection by the tetanus-causing bacteria. 
It contains an inactivated bacterial toxin that helps the immune 
system develop protection without causing the disease.
Do you know when the first vaccine was discovered?
Edward Jenner and the smallpox vaccine 
Smallpox was a deadly disease that caused blisters and killed 
millions. A milder disease called cowpox, seen in cows, could also 
infect humans. In the late 1700s, English doctor Edward Jenner 
discovered that people who had cowpox did not get smallpox. 
This led to the invention of the first vaccine and helped protect 
people from smallpox.
Our scientific heritage
Long before modern vaccines, India had a traditional method called 
variolation to protect against smallpox. It involved using material 
from a smallpox sore to scratch the skin and create a mild infection 
and build immunity. People who performed this practice were known 
as teekedaars.
Think like a scientist
Observations
Jenner observed that milkmaids who had 
cowpox did not catch smallpox, likely because 
the two viruses are related.
Results
He found that people who were infected 
with cowpox sap were now resistant to 
smallpox.
 
Application
Mass vaccination eventually helped 
eradicate smallpox worldwide.
Experimentation
He tested this by injecting cowpox sap into a 
boy, who later showed no illness when exposed 
to smallpox.

Chapter 3 — Health: The Ultimate Treasure
Vaccines are one of the most effective ways to protect people 
of all ages — from infants to the elderly — against many serious 
diseases. They help prevent illnesses, reduce the spread of 
infections, and save millions of lives every year. It is important 
to remember that vaccines are preventive, not curative — they 
can help minimise serious diseases before they happen, but do 
not treat them once someone is already sick. Some people may 
fear or doubt vaccines, but scientists and doctors carefully test 
them for safety. Getting vaccinated not only protects you but also 
the people around you.
Ever heard of ...
India’s Role in Vaccine Production
India is one of the world’s largest vaccine 
producers. It manufactures vaccines on a 
massive scale and supplies them to many 
countries. Indian vaccine companies 
played a key role during the COVID-19 
pandemic and continue to support global 
health efforts. 
Be a scientist
Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan was a well-known Indian 
doctor and scientist. As Secretary of the Department 
of Biotechnology, he helped promote science and 
innovation in India. He played a key role in developing 
the Rotavirus vaccine, which protects children from 
diarrhoea. He believed in using research to create 
affordable healthcare and made a big difference in 
India’s health and biotechnology sectors.
3.5.1 Treatment of diseases
If our immune system fails to protect us against an infectious 
disease, we fall ill and need to visit a doctor. The doctor may 
give us medicines called antibiotics, which kill the bacteria that 
might have caused the disease. Antibiotics work only against 
bacterial infections because they target parts of bacterial cells 
that are different from human or other animal cells. They do not 
work against viruses or diseases caused by protozoa.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Think like a scientist
Discovery of the first antibiotic, Penicillin
Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, 
a bacteriologist from London. While studying harmful 
bacteria, he noticed that a mould on a discarded petri 
dish stopped the bacteria from growing. He realized 
the mould released a substance that killed the bacteria. 
This chance discovery led to the discovery of penicillin, 
the first  antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.
Though antibiotics are effective in protecting us against 
bacterial infections and have saved millions of lives since their 
discovery, their indiscriminate use has led to a decline in their 
effectiveness (Fig. 3.5a). Nowadays, there are news headlines 
about antibiotic resistance, a phenomenon where bacteria that 
were earlier killed by a given antibiotic are found to survive 
and multiply despite treatment with that antibiotic. This makes

z Study the infographic given in Fig. 3.5b. How do you think 
the antibiotic resistance has been developed in bacterial 
pathogens? What precautions may be taken to reduce 
antibiotic resistance?
	
z To tackle the problem of antibiotic resistance, we must 
use antibiotics wisely — only when prescribed by a doctor, 
in the correct dose, and for the right duration. Avoiding 
unnecessary use helps prevent the rise of resistant bacteria 
and keeps antibiotics effective for future generations.
Traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani 
have been used in India for many years to manage common 
health problems. They use natural substances like herbs, oils,

and focus on a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet. While these 
systems can help with some conditions, and are useful for 
everyday well-being, they may not be effective for all diseases 
and at all stages.

symptoms and improving quality of life through medication, 
lifestyle changes, and rehabilitation. Early diagnosis and

z Students maintain a health diary for at least a month to track 
food, hygiene, exercise, sleep, screen time, and emotional 
state.
	
z Read about Indian scientists like Suniti Solomon, Asima 
Chatterjee, Dr. Yellapragada Subbarao, Dr. Mary Poonen
