You must have taken an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) at some 
time in your life. ORS is used to treat dehydration by keeping 
your body hydrated. You have learnt to prepare ORS at home in 
Curiosity, Grade 6. You may have wondered why every sip of 
your homemade ORS tastes the same, no matter how much you 
drink. Why does it not taste salty in one sip and sweet in another? 
This is because when you add sugar and salt to water, they 
form a mixture in which the components are evenly distributed 
throughout. 
Can you predict whether this mixture is uniform or 
not (Fig. 9.1)? What happens when chalk powder is mixed 
with water—does it form a uniform mixture? 
When salt and sugar are mixed with water, a uniform 
mixture is formed, whereas when chalk powder or sand, or 
sawdust is mixed with water, the components are not evenly 
distributed. Such mixtures are known as non-uniform 
mixtures (Fig. 9.2a and 9.2b).
Let us explore the science of mixing things together.
9.1 What Are Solute, Solvent, and Solution?
A uniform mixture, such as that of salt or sugar, and water, is 
called a solution. Whenever a solid is 
mixed with a liquid to form a solution, the 
solid component is called the solute, and 
the liquid component is called the solvent. 
The solute dissolves in the solvent to form 
a solution (Fig. 9.3).
Solute + Solvent 
 Solution
When a solution is formed by mixing 
two liquids, it is not always clear which 
substance is dissolving the other. In such 
cases, the substance present in smaller 
amount is called the solute, while the one 
in larger amount is called the solvent.
We 
know 
air 
is 
a 
mixture. 
Would 
a 
mixture of gases also be 
considered a solution?
Just as water can act as a solvent in liquid solutions, gases can 
also form solution — with air being a common example.
Air is a gaseous solution. Since nitrogen is present in the largest 
amount in the air, it is considered as the solvent, while oxygen, 
argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases are considered as solutes.

Ever heard of ...
The Chashni (sugar syrup) of the Indian 
sweet Gulab jamun is made of a large amount 
of sugar (solid) dissolved in a small amount 
of water (liquid). However, the water is still 
considered as the solvent and sugar as  the 
solute (Fig. 9.4)!

dipped in sugar syrup
9.2  How Much Solute Can a Fixed Amount of 
Solvent Dissolve?
Activity 9.1: Let us investigate
	
z Take a clean glass tumbler and fill it 
half with water.
	
z Add one spoon of salt into it and stir well 
till it dissolves completely (Fig. 9.5).
	
z Gradually add a spoonful of salt into the glass tumbler and 
stir. Observe how many spoons of salt you can add before it 
stops dissolving completely.
	
z Record your observations in Table 9.1.

Some discussion points
	
z How many spoons of salt were you able to dissolve before 
some of it remained undissolved?
	
z What does this indicate about the capacity of water to 
dissolve salt?
What will happen if we 
keep on adding more 
salt in a given amount 
of water?
Chapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions
You might have observed that, initially, the salt completely 
dissolves in the water, forming a solution. After adding a few 
more spoons of salt, a stage comes when the added salt does not 
dissolve completely and the undissolved salt settles at the bottom. 
This indicates that the water can no longer dissolve any more salt 
because it has reached its limit. The solution in which more solute 
can be dissolved at a given temperature, is called an unsaturated 
solution (Fig. 9.5). However, when the solute stops dissolving and 
begins to settle at the bottom, the solution is called a saturated 
solution at that particular temperature (Fig. 9.6).
The amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution 
(or solvent) is termed as its concentration. Depending upon the 
amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution, it can be 
called a dilute solution (less amount of solute) or a concentrated 
solution (more amount of solute). Dilute and concentrated are 
relative terms. 
So, one can say in Activity 9.1, the solution obtained by 
dissolving one spoon of salt is dilute as compared to that obtained 
by dissolving two or more spoons of salt. 
Can you now reflect — which solution is more concentrated; 
2 spoons of salt in 100 mL of water or 4 spoons of salt in 50 mL 
of water?
From Activity 9.1, we can say that the maximum amount of 
solute that dissolves in a fixed quantity of the solvent is called its 
solubility. 
Does temperature affect the solubility of a solute?
Let us find out!
9.2.1 How does temperature affect the solubility of a 
solute?
Activity 9.2: Let us experiment  
(Demonstration activity)
	
z Take about 50 mL of water in a glass beaker and measure its 
temperature using a laboratory thermometer, say 20 °C.
	
z Add a spoonful of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) 
to the water and stir until it dissolves. 
Continue adding small amounts of baking 
soda while stirring, till some solid baking 
soda is left undissolved at the bottom of 
the beaker.

heating device.

z Now, heat the contents to 50 °C while 
stirring (Fig. 9.7). 
	
z What happens to the undissolved baking 
soda? 
	
z You will observe that it has dissolved.
	
z Continue adding more baking soda while 
stirring at this temperature until some 
solid baking soda remains undissolved.
	
z Again, heat the contents further to 70 °C 
while continuing to stir. What do you 
observe?
	
z The undissolved baking soda dissolves.
	
z What do you infer from this experiment? 
Water at 70 °C dissolves more baking soda 
than water at 50 °C. The amount of baking 
soda dissolved in water at 20 °C is even lesser. 
It has been found that for most of 
the substances, the solubility increases with an increase in 
temperature. We can also say that a saturated solution at a 
particular temperature behaves as an unsaturated solution if the 
temperature is increased.
Our scientific heritage
Water has primarily been used as a solvent for the preparation of 
medicinal formulations in Ayurveda, Siddha, and other traditional 
systems of medicine in India. Additionally, drug formulations have 
been prepared using hydro-alcoholic extracts of the herbs. The 
Indian systems of medicine have also referred to the use of oils, 
ghee, milk, and other substances as solvents for drug formulations, 
to help achieve the therapeutic benefits of the drug.

Do gases also dissolve in water?
9.3  Solubility of Gases
Many gases, including oxygen, dissolve in water. Oxygen 
dissolves in water only to a small extent. Even though present 
in minute quantities, it is this dissolved oxygen that sustains 
all aquatic life, including plants, fishes, and other organisms.
Is the mixture of gases in water a uniform or non-uniform 
mixture?
It is a uniform mixture because the gases 
dissolve evenly in water to form a solution.
Does temperature affect the solubility 
of gases in liquids also? If so, how?
It has been observed that the solubility 
of gases generally decreases as temperature 
increases. More oxygen can dissolve in 
cold water, ensuring sufficient oxygen for 
aquatic life (Fig. 9.8). On the other hand, 
when water warms up, the solubility of 
oxygen decreases.
Now I understand that the mixtures we use can be 
of two types—uniform and non-uniform. Uniform 
mixtures are called solutions, and their components 
are not visible separately. In non-uniform mixtures, 
the components can be seen either with the naked 
eye or with a magnifying device.
I observed that in some non-uniform mixtures, such 
as sawdust in water, the sawdust floats, whereas 
in the mixture of sand and water, the sand sinks. 
I wonder why that happens?

9.4 Why Do Objects Float or Sink in Water?
You must have observed that some objects float while 
others sink in water (Fig. 9.9). You may have noticed that, 
while washing rice, husk particles present in the rice float 
on the surface of water while rice sinks to the bottom 
of the container. Why does this happen? If you add oil 
to water, it floats on water. Generally, it is believed that 
objects that float in a liquid are lighter and others that 
sink are heavier than the liquid.
A wooden stick and an iron rod may be of the same size, 
yet the iron rod feels much heavier. When we say that iron 
is heavier than wood, we are referring to a special property 
known as density, which describes the heaviness of an object. 
Note
However, the density of a substance is not the only factor that 
decides whether it will float or sink in a particular liquid.
Let us explore further.
9.5 What Is Density?
Imagine a crowded bus where many people are packed 
together — this is an example of high density whereas, 
the same bus with only a few people is an example of 
low density. Similarly, a forest where trees grow close 
to each other is called a dense forest (Fig. 9.10a), but if 
the trees are far apart (Fig. 9.10b), it is considered less 
dense.
How do scientists define density? 
Let us find out.
We have learnt that matter is anything that possesses 
mass and occupies space (volume). Density is defined 
as the mass present in a unit volume of that substance.
The density of a substance may be expressed 
mathematically using the formula:
Density = 
Mass
Volume
The density of a substance is independent of its shape or size. 
However, it is dependent on temperature and pressure. Pressure 
primarily affects the density of gases, while its effect on solids 
and liquids is negligible.

while others sink in water

Chapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions
 Fig. 9.11: Packed oil
Think like a scientist 
Have you noticed that some packets of ghee or oil are 
labelled with a volume of 1 litre but a weight of only say 
910 grams (Fig. 9.11)? What does this tell us about the 
density of the oil, and is it less or more than that of water?
The units in which density is expressed will depend upon the 
units of mass and volume taken. As you have learnt, the SI units 
of mass and volume are kilogram (kg) and cubic metre (m3), 
respectively. Therefore, the SI unit of density is kilogram per cubic 
metre, abbreviated as kg/m3. In case of liquids, other units of density 
are also used for convenience, such as gram per millilitre, abbreviated 
as g/mL and gram per cubic centimetre, abbreviated as g/cm3. 
Conversion factor for density 
1 kg/m3 = 1000 g/m3 = 1000 g/1000 L = 1 g/L = 1 g/1000 mL = 
1 g/1000 cm3
The mass of 1 mL of water is close to 1 g at room temperature. 
For the measurement of the mass of water, we generally consider 
the volume in mL and its mass in g. Hence, 10 mL of water would 
be approximately 10 g. Similarly, 100 mL of water would be 
approximately 100 g.
Suppose the mass of an aluminium block is 27 g and its volume 
is 10 cm3, its density is 2.7 g/cm3.
From this, it can be said that aluminium is 2.7 times denser 
than water. We express this fact by saying that the relative 
density of aluminium with respect to water is 2.7. It is a number 
without any units.

9.5.1 Determination of density 
The density of an object can be determined by measuring its 
mass and volume.
How to measure mass? 
You learnt the term ‘mass’ in Curiosity, Grade 6. Mass is the 
quantity of matter present in any object. The instrument used to 
measure the mass of an object is known as a balance. You must 
have seen various types of balances being used by shopkeepers. 
Here, we are using a digital weighing balance to measure the 
mass. You learnt in chapter ‘Exploring Forces’ that on Earth, 
weight and mass are closely related.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
You may measure the mass by doing the following activity.
Activity 9.3: Let us measure
	
z Switch ON the digital weighing balance.
	
z Observe the initial reading on the digital weighing 
balance display. 
	
z It should show a zero reading. If not, then we must 
bring it to zero by pressing the tare or reset button 
(Fig. 9.12a).
	
z Place a dry and clean watch glass or butter paper 
on the pan.
	
z Note the reading on the digital weighing balance.
	
z Reset the digital weighing balance reading to zero 
by pressing the tare or reset button as shown in 
Fig. 9.12b.
	
z Now, carefully place the solid object, such as stone, 
on the watch glass (Fig. 9.12c).
	
z Note the reading displayed on the balance, which 
gives the mass of the stone, say 16.400 g.
(You may use any other type of balance available in 
your school.)

The mass of a liquid may be measured by replacing 
the watch glass with a beaker and pouring the desired 
amount of liquid into it.
A step further
As mentioned in Chapter 5, the words ‘mass’ and 
‘weight’ are often used interchangeably in everyday 
language. But they have different meanings in 
science, which can sometimes cause confusion. 
Mass is the quantity of matter present in an object 
or a substance. Its units are gram (g) and kilogram 
(kg). On the other hand, weight is the force by which 
the Earth attracts an object or a substance towards 
itself, and it is measured in newtons (N). Most balances (except two-pan 
balances like in Fig. 9.13) actually measure weight, but their scales are marked 
in mass units, so they show values in grams or kilograms (Fig. 9.12c).

Fig. 9.15: Measuring cylinders of different 
capacities
How to measure volume?
A tetra pack says it contains 200 mL buttermilk (chach) (Fig. 9.14). 
What does that mean?
You learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 that volume is the space 
occupied by an object. You also know that the SI unit of volume 
is cubic metres, written as m³. It is the volume of a cube whose 
each side is one metre in length. Volume of smaller objects is 
conveniently expressed in a decimetre cube (dm3) or centimetre 
cube (cm3). One centimetre cube is also written as one cc. Volume 
of liquids is expressed in litres (L) which is equivalent to 1 dm3. 
A commonly used submultiple of a litre is millilitre (mL) which is 
equivalent to 1 cm3.  
One of the common apparatuses used to 
measure the volume of liquids is a measuring 
cylinder. It is a narrow transparent cylindrical 
container with one side open and the other side 
closed as shown in Fig. 9.15. There are markings 
on the transparent body of the cylinder that 
indicate the volume of liquid in the measuring 
cylinder. We can use it to measure the desired 
amount of a liquid.
Measuring cylinders are available in different 
sizes to measure volume — 5 mL, 10 mL, 25 mL, 
50  mL, 100 mL, 250 mL, etc (Fig.  9.15). How 
accurately 
can 
these 
measuring 
cylinders 
measure?
Let us find out!
Activity 9.4: Let us observe and calculate
In Curiosity, Grade 6, chapter ‘Temperature and Its Measurement’, 
you learnt how to use the thermometer and to find its smallest 
reading; you can do the same with a measuring cylinder. 
Take a measuring cylinder and observe it carefully. Note 
down the following:
	
z What is the maximum volume it can measure?
Now look at the measuring cylinder (Fig. 9.16) carefully. The 
cylinder is marked as 100 mL; therefore, it can measure volume 
up to 100 mL.
What is the smallest volume it can measure? Look at the 
measuring cylinder again.
	
z How much is the volume difference indicated between the 
two bigger marks (for example, between 10 mL and 20 mL)?
Fig. 9.14: A pack of 
buttermilk of 200 mL
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
	
z How many smaller divisions are there between the two 
bigger marks?
	
z How much volume does one small division indicate?
The smallest volume that the measuring cylinder can read 
is__________.
For the measuring cylinder shown in 
Fig. 9.16, the volume difference indicated 
between 10 mL and 20 mL, or between 40 mL 
and 50 mL, is 10 mL.
The number of divisions between these 
marks is 10.
So, one small division can read 10 ÷ 10 = 1 mL.
That is, the smallest value that this measuring cylinder can 
read is 1 mL.
The smallest volume that a measuring cylinder can measure 
depends on the capacity of the measuring cylinder. Usually it is 
0.1 mL in smaller measuring cylinders with a capacity of 10 mL 
or 25 mL, it is 1 mL in a 100 mL measuring cylinder, 2 mL in a 
250 mL measuring cylinder, and 5 mL in a 500 mL measuring 
cylinder. Suppose we want to take 70 mL of water. If we use a 
50 mL measuring cylinder, it would not be possible to measure 
70 mL of water in one step. First, we have to measure 50 mL water 
and then 20 mL. Measuring volume in more than one step is not 
convenient. On the other hand, if a 250 mL or 500 mL measuring 
cylinder is used, the measurement can be done in one step but 
the accuracy would be reduced as the smallest volume that these 
measuring cylinders can measure is greater than that of a 100 mL 
measuring cylinder. Hence, a 100 mL measuring cylinder is the 
best choice for this measurement. 
Activity 9.5: Let us measure 50 mL of water 
	
z Place a clean, dry measuring cylinder on a flat surface. 
	
z Pour water slowly into the measuring cylinder up to the 
required mark, as shown in Fig. 9.17.
	
z If required, adjust the level of water in the measuring 
cylinder by adding or removing a small amount of water 
using a dropper.
	
z On careful observation, you will notice that the water inside 
the measuring cylinder forms a curved surface. This curved 
surface is called the meniscus (Fig. 9.18).
	
z Read the mark on the measuring cylinder that coincides with 
the bottom of the meniscus for water or other colourless 
liquids.

cylinder of 100 mL
Why are measuring cylinders 
always designed narrow and 
tall instead of wider and 
short like a beaker?
Chapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions
	
z Make sure that the eyes are at level with the bottom of the 
meniscus while noting the readings as shown in Fig. 9.18.

the measuring cylinder

z Once it reaches the required 
level—that is, 50 mL — 
transfer this water to the 
required container.
In case of coloured liquids 
the mark on the measuring 
cylinder should coincide with 
the top of the meniscus!
Determining volume of solid objects with regular 
shapes 
Activity 9.6: Let us calculate
	
z Collect various objects with a cuboid shapes, such as a 
notebook, a shoe box, or a dice.
	
z Measure the length (l), width (w), and height (h) of the objects 
using a scale. Suppose the length of the notebook is 25 cm, 
the width is 18 cm, and the height is 2 cm. 
	
z Calculate the volume by using the following formula.
Volume = l × w × h
Volume = 25 cm × 18 cm × 2 cm = 900 cm3
	
z Record in your notebook.
Determining volume of objects with irregular shapes
Imagine you have an object, like a stone, that does not have a 
regular shape. To calculate its density, the main challenge is to 
find its volume. Let us learn how the volume of a solid with an 
irregular shape can be determined.

taken in Table 9.2.
	
z Tie the object, say a stone, with a thread and slowly lower it 
into the measuring cylinder.
	
z What do you notice? 
	
z Record the final volume after the level rises, say 55 mL, as 
shown in Fig. 9.19b.
	
z Subtract the initial volume from the final volume after the 
object is put into the measuring cylinder. This is the volume 
of the object.

Let us dig deeper! 
Did you know that our planet, Earth, is 
composed of several layers, such as crust, 
upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and 
inner core, each with its particular range of 
density? The outermost layer, called the crust, 
is the lightest and the density of the different 
layers increases as we move towards the 
centre (Fig. 9.20). As one moves deeper into the 
Earth, both the pressure and the temperature 
rise significantly, making the materials heavier 
and more compact.
Ever heard of ...
In ancient times, before large ships 
were invented, people used bamboo 
and wooden logs to travel across 
rivers and seas (Fig. 9.21). Bamboo 
was used because it is light, hollow, 
and floats easily on water. People tied 
bamboo poles together to make rafts 
and small boats for fishing, trading, 
and crossing water bodies. Wooden 
logs, especially from strong trees were 
either hollowed out to make boats or 
used as rafts. These simple boats, made from locally available materials, 
were important for moving around and connecting different places. 
Even today, similar traditional boats made of bamboo or wood are used 
in some regions—not just for transport, but also as tourist attractions.
Fig. 9.21: Bamboo raft floats 
on water
9.5.2 Effect of temperature on density
Generally, the density of a substance decreases with heating and 
increases with cooling. This can be explained on the basis of 
what you have learnt in chapter ‘Particulate 
Nature of Matter’. As temperature increases, 
the particles of a substance whether, solid, 
liquid, or gas, tend to move away and 
spread. This results in an increase in volume 
but there is no change in mass. Since the 
Density = Mass/Volume, upon heating, the 
volume increases and the density decreases. 
This explains why hot air moves up as it is less 
dense than the cool air around it. The hot air 
balloon works on the same principle (Fig. 9.22).

9.5.3 Effect of pressure on density
Pressure affects density differently depending on the state of 
matter. For gases, increasing pressure causes the particles to 
move closer together. As a result, the volume of the gas decreases 
and its density increases. In the case of liquids, pressure has a 
small effect because they are nearly incompressible. We have 
learnt in chapter ‘Particulate Nature of Matter’ that the particles 
in solids are very close to each other. So, how is the density of 
solids affected when pressure is applied? Solids are even less 
affected by pressure than liquids, and changes in their density 
are usually negligible.
Ever heard of ...
Why does ice float on water? 
Ice floats on water because 
it is lighter than liquid water 
(Fig. 9.23). Water has a special 
property 
that 
its 
density 
is highest at 4 °C. It means 
water is heaviest at 4 °C. 
As 
the 
temperature 
drops, 
and water turns into ice at 
0 °C, it undergoes a change 
in 
structure—the 
particles 
arrange themselves in a way that takes up more space. This process is 
called expansion. Because the same amount of water now occupies a 
larger volume, its density decreases. As a result, ice becomes lighter 
than liquid water and floats on its surface.
This is important for animals living in lakes and oceans because 
ice floats, it forms a layer on top, keeping the water underneath warm 
enough for fish and other creatures to survive, even in extremely 
cold weather.

In this chapter, you have learnt the concept 
of density and how it explains partially why 
some objects float while others sink.

Chapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions
Snapshots  
	

A solution is said to be formed when two or more substances mix to form 
a uniform mixture.
	

In the solution formed by dissolving a solid in a liquid, the solid component 
is known as a solute and the liquid component is known as a solvent.
	

In a solution formed by mixing two liquids, the component present in less 
quantity is known as solute and the other component is called solvent. 
	

In air, nitrogen is considered as a solvent, while oxygen, argon, carbon 
dioxide, and other gases are considered as solutes.
	

A solution in which the maximum amount of solute has been dissolved, 
and no more of it can be dissolved at that temperature is called a saturated 
solution.
	

A solution in which more solute can be dissolved at a given temperature 
is called an unsaturated solution.
	

Solubility is the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in a fixed 
quantity (100 mL) of a solution or a solvent at a particular temperature.
	

Generally, in liquids, the solubility of solids increases and that of gases 
decreases with an increase in temperature.
	

The amount of matter present in an object is known as its mass.
	

The space occupied by an object or a substance is known as its volume.
	

Devices used to measure mass and volume are a weighing balance and a 
measuring cylinder, respectively.
	

The mass per unit volume of a substance is known as its density 
(Density = Mass/Volume).
	

Generally, density decreases with an increase in temperature and 
pressure affects density differently depending on the state of matter.

Our scientific heritage
Ningel village in Manipur’s Thoubal district is a place where salt is 
still produced using traditional methods. The village has a few salt 
wells, one of which is lined with a 100-year-old tree trunk placed into 
the ground to draw up salty water. A few families mostly women, 
continue this sacred practice by collecting the salt solution and boiling 
it in large metal pans over firewood kilns. Once the water evaporates 
and salt crystals form, they are shaped into round ‘salt cakes’ using 
banana leaves and handmade tools. These cakes are then wrapped in 
a traditional cloth (phanek) to protect them. The salt cakes are believed 
to have some medicinal value too. 
Salt in Ningel is more than just food — it is history, culture, belief, 
and a beautiful example of India’s living heritage.
