Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye
The human eye can only see objects that are above a certain 
size. For a long time, many tiny things around us remained 
unknown. Long ago, people discovered that a curved piece of 
glass could make small things look bigger. The piece of glass 
was shaped like a lentil seed — thick in the middle and thin at 
the edge — hence they called it a lens. Over time, lenses were 
improved to become more powerful. Each new tool, from simple 
magnifying glasses to microscopes, helped humans see what 
their eyes could not. The invention of the microscope opened 
a fascinating hidden world filled with tiny living creatures. We 
will explore some of these life forms in this chapter.
You have already learnt about the amazing variety of living 
beings. Just look around — there are so many beautiful plants 
and animals! They are of all shapes, sizes, and colours. Some 
living beings are tiny, while others are really big. They differ not 
only in their structure but also in many other features. All these 
living beings, whether plants or animals, are called organisms. 
Have you ever noticed the smallest organism around you that is 
visible to the naked eye? Think about it — how small a thing can 
your eyes actually see? 
You might have seen some people using reading glasses. How 
does it help them see better? Or what happens when we use a 
magnifying glass to observe something?
Activity 2.1: Let us observe
	
z Take a round-bottom flask made up of glass as shown in 
Fig. 2.1. Fill it with water.
	
z Close the mouth of the flask with a cork.
	
z Now, place the flask on an open book and look at 
the letters through it.
Do you notice something interesting? The letters 
appear larger when seen through the flask! This 
happens because the flask filled with water acts like a 
magnifying glass. Now, use a real magnifying glass to 
look at small organisms, like an ant. Were you able to 
see the details of its body more clearly?
For a long time, people were curious to explore the 
tiny organisms around them, but they could not see them 
with their naked eyes. So, how did we finally discover 
this invisible world? Do you know which scientific 
discovery helped us see the tiny world for the first time?

Ever heard of ...
In 1665, a scientist named Robert Hooke 
published a book called Micrographia. He 
was a careful observer, and a skilled artist. 
In this book, he showed detailed drawings 
of tiny things that people had never seen 
before — things he saw using a tool we now 
call a microscope.
His microscope made things look 200 
to 300 times bigger, than what one could 
see with the unaided eye. One day, he 
looked at a thin slice of cork and saw it 
was made of many small, empty spaces. 
These compartments reminded him of a 
honeycomb. He drew what he saw and 
called each small space a cell. This was the 
first time the word cell was used in science 
to describe the basic unit of life.
Around the same time in 1660s, Antonie 
van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist, made 
better lenses that allowed him to build more 
useful microscopes. He was the first person 
to clearly see and describe tiny living things 
like bacteria and blood cells.  Because of this, 
he is known as the Father of Microbiology.

2.1 What Is a Cell?
All living beings are made up of cells. You might wonder what 
cells actually look like. Let us take a closer look at the basic 
structure of a cell using a microscope.
Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye
Activity 2.2: Let us study a cell  
(Teacher demonstration activity)
	
z Take an onion bulb from your kitchen or garden and wash it 
thoroughly with water.
	
z Cut the onion bulb vertically into pieces.
	
z Take one piece of onion and pull out the thin, transparent 
layer from its inner surface with the help of forceps. This 
layer is called the onion peel.
	
z Place the peel in a petri dish containing a few drops of 
safranin (red-coloured stain) for 30 seconds. This will give 
a pinkish colour to the cells and help us see them clearly.  
	
z With the help of thin brush transfer the onion peel to another 
petri dish containing water to rinse 
the peel and remove extra stain.
	
z Now, carefully place the stained 
onion peel on the glass slide using 
a thin brush, ensuring it does not 
break or fold.
	
z Put a drop of glycerin over the 
onion peel on the slide. The 
glycerin will prevent drying of the 
cells and improve clarity for better 
visualisation of cells. 
	
z Slowly place a coverslip over the 
peel using a needle, such that no 
air bubbles get trapped.
	
z Use blotting paper to gently wipe 
off any extra glycerin around the 
edges of the coverslip.
	
z View the slide under a microscope 
or a foldscope. Compare it with 
Fig. 2.3c.
	
z What similarities do you find in 
Fig. 2.3c and Fig. 2.3d?
You will observe nearly rectangular 
structures under the microscope. These 
are the cells of the onion peel, which 
are closely arranged without any space 
between them. Try to observe the peels 
of the leaves of different plants around 
you. You will find that all plants are 
made up of cells. What do you think 
the body of an animal is made of?

Activity 2.3: Let us investigate
	
z Rinse your mouth with clean water.
	
z Use the blunt end of a clean toothpick, and gently scrape the 
inside of your cheek.
	
z Place the scraped material in a drop of water on a clean glass 
slide and spread it evenly.
	
z Add a drop of methylene blue (a blue-coloured stain) over 
the material on slide. Adding stain improves the visibility of 
the material under the microscope by increasing contrast.
	
z After one minute, add a drop of glycerin over the material on 
the slide to prevent the cells from drying.
	
z Now, carefully place a clean coverslip on the material, and 
remove the excess glycerin from the edges of the coverslip 
using blotting paper.
	
z Observe the slide under a microscope and draw what you 
see in your notebook.
What did you observe? You will observe a polygon-
shaped structure as shown in Fig. 2.4. These are cheek 
cells, which form the inner lining of your mouth.
What similarities and differences did you observe 
between the cells of onion peel in Activity 2.2 and 
human cheek cells in Activity 2.3? 
You have observed that cells have three main parts  
— a thin outer lining, a central region, and a small 
round structure inside it. The outer layer is called the 
cell membrane. The round structure in the middle is 
the nucleus, which is also covered by a thin membrane. The space 
between the cell membrane and nucleus is filled with cytoplasm. 
These three — cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus — are the 
basic parts of a cell. Some cells, like onion peel cells, have an 
extra outer layer called the cell wall. What is the importance of 
these structures in a cell? What functions do they perform? Are 
these functions important for the maintenance of life?
The cell membrane encloses the cytoplasm and nucleus. The 
cell membrane separates one cell from another. It is porous and 
allows the entry of materials essential for life processes and the 
exit of waste material.
Cytoplasm contains other components of the cell and 
compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and mineral 
salts. Most of the life processes take place within the cytoplasm.

Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye
The nucleus regulates all activities that occur within the cell. 
It also regulates growth.
The cell wall in the plant cell provides rigidity and strength 
to plants. This is why all cells are arranged compactly with each 
other and look firm in structure.
A step further
Cells in all parts of a plant have tiny rod-shaped structures called 
plastids. Some plastids, like chloroplasts, contain chlorophyll, which 
makes them green and helps in photosynthesis. In non-green parts, 
they help in the storage of substances. Plant cells also have a large, 
empty-looking space called a vacuole. This helps the plant cell store 
important substances, get rid of waste, and maintain the shape of 
the cell. This gives strength and support to the plant. In animal cells, 
vacuoles are usually not present, if present, they are usually small. 
These small vacuoles store certain substances dissolved in water 
(Fig. 2.5). So, a cell is not just a simple bag of liquid — it is a complex 
structure made up of many different parts, each with its own special 
function to allow the cell, and in turn the entire organism to work.

We have now understood the basic structure of cell. And we 
now also understand that plant and animal cells differ in shape and 
structure.
Do different animal cells also vary in their shape and structure?
2.1.1 Variation in shape and structure of cells
The muscle cell and the nerve cell of a human are shown in Fig. 2.6a 
and (b). What are the similarities and differences you see in them?
A muscle cell (Fig. 2.6a) is shaped like a spindle, while a nerve 
cell (Fig. 2.6b) is very long and has branches. Similarly, some cells 
are round in shape, while others are long and thin. The number 
of cells also varies in different organisms. Why do cells look so 
different from each other? Does the shape and structure of a cell 
relate to its function? 
(a) Muscle cell
(b) Nerve cell
Fig. 2.6: Different cells 
in humans
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
The unique shape, size, and structure of cells help them 
carry out their specific functions. But how do these cells help in 
performing various functions in the body? Let us find out.
You observed in Activity 2.3 that inner cheek cells are thin 
and flat. They form a protective lining on the inner surface of the 
cheek. Nerve cells also known as neurons carry messages in our 
body. The elongated shape and branched structure help them 
reach different parts of the body and pass on messages quickly. 
Similarly, plant cells also show variation. In plants, too, cells may 
be rectangular, elongated, oval, or even tube-like. Some plant 
cells form long tubes that help carry water throughout the plant.
You have already studied the digestive system in Grade 7. Different 
parts of the digestive system are made up of different types of cells. 
A group of muscle cells are present in the food pipe. These cells 
contract and relax in a wave-like manner, pushing the food down 
to the stomach. This movement is possible because muscle cells are 
thin, flexible, and spindle-shaped. The stomach also has different 
types of cells for performing different functions. Muscle cells in the 
stomach wall help churn the food. Other cells in the inner lining of 
the stomach produce digestive juices and acid that help break down 
the food. All these cells work together to make digestion possible.
2.2 What Are the Levels of Organisation in 
the Body of a Living Organism?
The body of a living organism is organised in a complex way. Cell 
(Fig. 2.7a), is the basic unit of life, just like a brick is the basic unit of wall 
(Fig. 2.3d). A group of similar cells forms a type of tissue (Fig. 2.7b). 
Different tissues are organised to form an organ (Fig. 2.7c). Several 
organs work together to form an organ system that performs a 
major function of the body (Fig. 2.7d). All the organ systems together 
make up a complete organism (Fig. 2.7e) — like a plant or an animal.
So, the levels of organisations are:
Cell 
 Tissue 
 Organ 
 Organ system 
 Organism
These levels of organisation help us understand how simple 
building blocks like cells come together to form a complex 
living being.
The life of complex living organisms begins with a single cell— 
‘egg’. The egg of any organism has an amazing ability to divide 
repeatedly to form a complete living being made up of many cells. 
Such living beings are called multicellular organisms. Animals, 
including humans, and plants are all examples of multicellular 
organisms.

Ever heard of ...
The yolk (the yellow part of an egg) of an 
ostrich egg is a single cell — the largest 
known 
cell 
in 
the 
living 
world — measuring about 130 
mm to 170 mm in diameter. The 
egg contains extra non-cellular 
material: a shell for protection and a white liquid that 
nourishes the cell during its continued development.
2.3 What Are Microorganisms?
Some living organisms are made up of just one or very few cells. 
They are so small that they can not be seen with the naked eye. 
These are called microorganisms. Some microorganisms, like 
bacteria and Amoeba, are made of just one cell (unicellular). Others, 
like some fungi and algae, have many cells (multicellular). They 
are found all around us — in water, soil, air, and even inside our 
body! But what do their cells look like? Are they like the plant and 
animal cells we just learnt about, or are they different? To observe 
the cells of a microorganism, again, we need to use a microscope 
which magnifies their size and makes them visible to us. Scientists 
have also created a low-cost and foldable paper microscope or 
foldscope. Foldscopes may not provide the same level of details 
like high-powered laboratory microscopes. However, these make 
microscopic world accessible to many people.
Let us now take a closer look at the fascinating world of microbes.
Activity 2.4: Let us observe pond water/
stagnant water
	
z Take a container and collect pond or stagnant water in it 
with the help of your teacher or elder(s).
	
z Use a dropper and place a drop of pond or stagnant water on 
a microscope or foldscope slide. Put a coverslip and observe 
it under the microscope or foldscope.
	
z Observe the tiny organisms found in the pond or stagnant 
water.
Activity 2.5: Let us observe soil suspension
	
z Take a beaker and collect some moist soil in it from the 
nearby field or garden. Do not touch the soil with your bare 
hands — use a spoon or gloves.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
	
z Pour some water into the beaker and stir it with a glass rod. 
The liquid, which may look dirty, has very fine particles of 
soil, and is called soil suspension. Keep it aside for some time 
and let the mixture settle.
	
z Use a dropper and take a drop of water from the top layer. 
Place the drop on a microscope slide.
	
z Cover it gently with a coverslip and observe it under the 
microscope (Fig. 2.8).
You may observe small moving organisms similar to those you saw 
in Activity 2.4. This indicates that even soil suspension contains a 
variety of tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the unaided eye.
The tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the naked eye are called 
microorganisms (micro means very small; organisms means living 
beings) or microbes.
Activity 2.6: Let us study
A group of students studying in Grade 8 performed Activities 2.4 
and 2.5. They also collected information from the library and 
internet. They recorded the data obtained after observing pond 
water in Table 2.1 and the data obtained after observing soil 
suspension in Table 2.2. They identified the microorganisms as 
protozoa, algae, fungi, and bacteria. You can record if you find 
any of these categories of organisms.

Did you also observe any of these microorganisms or 
something different? Record in your notebook and discuss in 
your class. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you have identified a variety 
of microorganisms. They are everywhere, and we can only see 
them with a microscope — a device that magnifies them 100 to 
400 times. Though microorganisms are small in size, they play an 
important role in our lives.
Ever heard of ...
Viruses are microscopic and acellular. Viruses 
multiply when they enter a living cell. They may 
infect plants, animals, or bacterial cells and may 
cause  a disease.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
2.4 How Are We Connected to Microbes?
Can we find microorganisms in other places, too? 
Let us have a discussion:
Have you ever seen a lemon, tomato, orange, or any 
other food item rot after being left outside for some 
time? If yes, you may have noticed a powdery or 
cotton-like growth on them (Fig. 2.9). This happens 
because they have been infected by microbes. But 
where did these microbes come from? How did they 
come in contact with the food?
This happens because microorganisms can be found 
everywhere, be it in water, soil, air, or even in some food items. 
You can use a foldscope 
or a microscope to explore 
surfaces of leaves, stems, 
roots, or any other part to 
see them. Like plants and 
animals, microorganisms 
also show great diversity. 
Some of them can even be 
found in extreme climatic 
conditions, such as hot 
water springs and snow 
cold zones as well as at moderate temperatures. You already know 
some of these organisms live inside our bodies, especially in our 
gut! You have studied in the chapter ‘Life Processes in Animals’ in 
Curiosity, Grade 7 that our intestine has many bacteria that help in 
digestion. Like plants and animals, microorganisms vary in shape, 
size, and structure. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you would have observed 
microorganisms of different shapes — spherical, rod-shape, or 
irregular.
How does the diversity of microorganisms play a role in our 
daily life? How do they help clean the environment?
2.4.1 Key players in cleaning the environment
Let us attempt to understand this by doing an activity.
Activity 2.7: Let us do
	
z Take an empty container and fill it halfway with garden soil.
	
z Add some fruit and vegetable peels to the container. 
Thereafter, put a layer of soil on it and leave it aside.
This is because you add many spices 
with salt or sugar to it which act as 
preservatives. High concentration 
of salt or sugar do not allow these 
organisms to grow on them.
But why do microorganisms 
not infect the pickles and 
murabbas?
Fig. 2.9: Fruit with microorganism 
growing on it
Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye
	
z After 2–3 weeks, observe the changes 
that have taken place.
	
z Do you observe any difference in the 
contents of the container?
You may find that peels of fruits and 
vegetables have turned into a dark-coloured 
material. This is manure, which is rich in 
nutrients and helps increase the fertility of 
the soil. But how did the peels of fruits and 
vegetables turn into manure?
In Activity 2.6, you saw that soil contains 
various kinds of microorganisms. Some of 
these microorganisms, like fungi and bacteria, 
act on the plant waste and slowly break it down into simpler, 
nutrient-rich manure. You may have seen gardeners in your 
school or in a field near your house collecting dry leaves and 
plant waste and putting them into pits. Do you now understand 
why they do this? It is to make natural manure.
Ancient Indian texts, particularly the Vedas, have references of 
the word ‘Krimi’ which means different tiny entities including 
‘Drishya’ (visible) and ‘Adrishya’ (invisible). Various Vedic texts 
mention their beneficial and harmful effects. 
Atharvaveda also refers to ‘Krimi’. 
Our scientific heritage
If you look around carefully, you might see decaying plants 
and fallen leaves stored in a container or lying in the garden, 
disappear after some time from the surroundings. This is 
because microorganisms breakdown and turn them into simpler 
substances rich in nutrients. These nutrients go back to the soil 
and help plants grow better. Microorganisms also decompose 
bodies of dead animals. So, microbes help recycle the waste and 
return important nutrients to nature. Manure formation occurs 
at optimal temperature and appropriate moisture level.
Isn’t it interesting? By now, you must have understood that 
bacteria and some fungi are types of microorganisms that play 
an important role in our lives. And guess what, these helpful 
bacteria can also decompose animal wastes like dung!
From Activity 2.7, we can also infer that microorganisms not 
only help in plant growth, but also clean our environment by 
breaking down waste.
Fig. 2.10: Recycling of nutrients by making 
manure
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
Now, think what would have happened if microorganisms did 
not exist on Earth?
A step further
Microbes as a source of biogas
Many microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, live in an oxygen-
free environment. Some of these bacteria have the ability to 
decompose plant and animal waste present in the environment or 
household wastewater. During the process, they release a mixture 
of gases containing carbon dioxide, and a high proportion of 
another gas, methane. This gas has been used as a fuel source for 
cooking, heating, generating electricity, and to even run vehicles.
Be a scientist
Dr. Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty (1938–2020) was a 
scientist who studied bacteria. In 1971, he developed 
a special bacterium that could break down oil spills, 
helping to clean the environment. His discovery 
received a patent in 1980. Patent is a copyright 
given to a person so that no one else can copy, use 
or sell his/her invention without permission. His 
work showed how microorganisms could be used 
to solve environmental problems like pollution.  He 
is remembered for his contributions to science and for protecting the 
environment using microbes. What are the other  problems which you 
think can be solved with the help of microorganisms? 
How does the diversity of microorganisms help in our kitchen?
2.4.2 Microorganisms and food
Let us try to understand by performing activities in the kitchen.
Activity 2.8: Let us perform
	
z Take two bowls A and B.
	
z In each, take 200 g of flour (atta or maida) and add a pinch 
of sugar.
	
z Now, in bowl A, add a small amount of yeast powder and mix 
it well with the flour.
	
z In bowl B, do not add any yeast, so that we can compare the 
results of the two bowls.
	
z Knead the flour of the two bowls with warm water to make 
soft dough (Fig. 2.11).
 (a) Dough in bowl A
(b) Dough in bowl B
Fig. 2.11: Change in the 
volume of flour after 
addition of yeast, sugar, and 
warm water
Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye
	
z Cover the dough with a damp cloth and keep it in a warm place.
	
z Observe both the bowls after 4–5 hours.
Did you find any change in the volume, smell, or texture of the 
dough? If not, leave the dough for some more time. After some time, 
you may notice that the dough in bowl A, where yeast was added, has 
risen slightly, become fluffy, and has a different smell compared to 
the dough kneaded without yeast. Why does this happen? What is the 
role of yeast? Why did we add sugar and warm water to the flour?
Yeast is a type of microorganism. It belongs to a group 
of microorganisms, called fungi. Yeast grows well in warm 
conditions. You may recall from chapter ‘Life Process in Animals’ 
in Grade 7 that, like other organisms, yeast also respires and breaks 
down food to release energy for their growth and carry out life 
processes. During this process, carbon dioxide is released, which 
forms bubbles that makes the dough soft and fluffy. Yeast also 
produces a small amount of alcohol during this process, which 
gives the dough a slightly different smell. This special property of 
yeast is used in the process of making breads, cakes, and more! 
In addition to yeast, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, help in 
fermentation of batter for making idli and dosa, and dough for 
making bhatura.
Activity 2.9: Let us prepare
	
z Take two small glass bowls — label them ‘A’ and ‘B’.
	
z Pour lukewarm milk in bowl A, and cold milk in bowl B.
	
z Now, add a small spoonful of curd to each bowl and mix well 
using a spoon.
	
z Cover both bowls. Keep bowl A in a warm place and bowl B in 
a cool place (like a refrigerator) for a few hours or overnight.
	
z Observe the changes in the glass bowls. Write your predictions 
and observations in Table 2.4.

You will observe that in bowl 
A, the milk has turned into curd 
after a few hours and has become 
little sour. Whereas in bowl B, the 
milk has not curdled, but it might 
be a little sour. Do you know why 
this happens? The curd contains 
several types of bacteria. One 
of them is Lactobacillus. This 
bacterium feeds on the sugar in 
the milk (lactose), multiplies, and 
ferments the milk to form curd. 
Instead of producing alcohol (like 
yeast), these bacteria produce 
lactic acid, which makes curd 
sour. These bacteria grow well in warm conditions. That is why 
curd is formed in bowl A but not in bowl B.
We can categorise the microorganisms into different 
categories, such as protozoa, fungi, bacteria, some algae, and 
more. Some bacteria, such as Rhizobium, form the swollen 
regions called nodules and live in them as shown in Fig. 2.12. 
Roots of certain legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils have 
root nodules that contain Rhizobium bacteria. These bacteria 
trap nitrogen from the air and make it useful for the plants. 
This helps plants grow better without chemical fertilisers. 
That is why farmers grow legumes in rotation with other crops. 
This  naturally increases the nitrogen in the soil and keeps it 
healthy for the next crop.
2.4.3 Amazing microalgae: tiny helpers in water 
Microalgae are microscopic plant-like organisms that live in 
water, soil, air, and even on trees. They make their own food using 
sunlight.  While doing this, they also release oxygen and produce 
more than half of the Earth’s oxygen supply. They are rich in 
nutrients and serve as a food source for many aquatic animals. 
Some, like Spirulina, Chlorella, and Diatoms, are also used by 
humans as health supplements and medicines. Microalgae also 
help in cleaning water and are used to make biofuel.
However, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction are 
threatening microalgal diversity and abundance. It is important 
to conserve these tiny organisms to protect the environment and 
maintain oxygen balance on Earth.

Spirulina, a microalga, is called a superfood 
because of its health benefits. Spirulina is 
also a good source of vitamin B12, which is 
essential for our body. It has a lot of protein—
more than 60 per cent of its body weight—and 
only a small amount of fat and sugar.  
Nowadays, farming of Spirulina is becoming a feasible livelihood 
opportunity. You can grow Spirulina easily by following these steps:
1.	 Set a clear glass tank in a bright place away from direct sunlight.
2.	 Cover the tank with a shade net, or keep the tank at a place with 
moderate temperature conditions.
3.	 Fill the tank with pond water.
4.	 Add living Spirulina collected from a 
pond.
5.	 Stir the growing Spirulina twice a week.
6.	 After 3–6 weeks, Spirulina may be 
harvested from the tank by filtering it 
through a fine cloth.
Conservation of microalgae is a good practice for ensuring food 
security and livelihood development.
2.5 Why Is Cell Considered to Be a Basic Unit 
of Life?
The body of all living organisms are made up of tiny building 
blocks called cells. A single cell contains various components 
that help organisms perform various functions. The bodies of all 
plants and animals are made up of many cells. Therefore, they are 
called multicellular (many-celled) organisms. In multicellular 
organisms, cells carry out specialised functions individually but 
also cooperate with each other to increase the chance of survival.
Some microorganisms, such as bacteria 
and protozoa, are made up of just one cell. 
These are called unicellular (single-celled) 
organisms. They carry out all the functions 
necessary for their survival in a single cell. 
Other microbes, like algae and fungi, are 
made up of one or more cells. For example, 
yeast is a unicellular fungus while mould is 
a multicellular fungus.

nucleoid region

Like animal and plant cells, the cells of microorganisms are 
also surrounded by a cell membrane. Cells of fungi additionally 
have a cell wall, but they do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot 
make their own food through photosynthesis. Bacteria do not 
have a well-defined nucleus and a nuclear membrane. Instead 
they have a nucleoid. This feature distinguishes them from cells 
of yeast, protozoa, algae, fungi, plants, and animals.
We have only looked at a few basic cell structures here. The cell 
has other components about which you will learn in higher classes.
For observing subcellular components, we need microscopes 
with  high magnification. An electron microscope magnifies the 
cell about 10,00,000 times, where we can see more structures 
present in a cell.
By now, you must have understood that all living beings, 
including microorganisms, are made up of one or more cells. 
Their cells differ in size, shape, and structure. Plant and animal 
cells also have some differences. Understanding these differences 
helps us learn how these organisms function differently.
In this chapter, we have learnt about the beneficial 
microorganisms. However, there are some microbes that cause 
diseases in plants and animals including humans. We will learn 
about some of the diseases caused by microbes in the next chapter.
Snapshots  
	

Microorganisms are small-sized organisms and are not visible to the 
unaided eye.
	

They can live in all kinds of environments, and even in the bodies of 
plants and animals.
	

They are either unicellular or multicellular. Bacteria and protozoans 
are unicellular; fungi can be unicellular or multicellular, while plants 
and animals are multicellular.
	

The cell is a basic unit of life.
	

The body of all living organisms is made up of cells. A cell contains 
various components which help the organisms perform their functions 
and survive.
	

A typical cell is bounded by a cell membrane, filled with cytoplasm 
and contains a nucleus. Plant, fungal, and bacterial cells have an extra 
covering, called a cell wall, around the cell membrane. Bacteria lack a 
well-defined nucleus.
	

Cells differ in shape and size. Their shape is related to the function 
performed by them.
	

Bacteria, fungi, and protozoa are different kinds of microorganisms.
	

Viruses are also small in size, but they are different from other 
microorganisms since they reproduce only inside the host organism.

Microorganisms can be beneficial or harmful to us.
	

Some microorganisms decompose the plant and animal waste into 
simple substances and clean up the environment.
	

Some microorganisms reside in the root nodules of legumes, such as 
peas, beans, and lentils. They trap nitrogen from the air and increase 
the soil fertility.
	

Yeasts are fungi which are used in the process of making breads, cakes, 
pastries, idlis, dosas, and bhaturas.
	

Lactobacillus is used in the curd formation at home and fermentation 
process in food industry.

2.	 Aanandi took two test tubes and marked 
them A and B. She put two spoonfuls of 
sugar solution in each of the test tubes. In test tube B, she 
added a spoonful of yeast. Then she attached two incompletely 
inflated balloons to the mouth of each test tube. She kept the 
set-up in a warm place, away from sunlight. 
(i)	 What do you predict will happen after 3–4 days? She 
observed that the balloon attached to testtube B was 
inflated. What can be a possible explanation for this?
(a)	 Water evaporated in test tube B and filled the 
balloon with the water vapour. 
(b)	 The warm atmosphere expanded the air inside the 
test tube B, which inflated the balloon.
(c)	 Yeast produced a gas inside the test tube B which 
inflated the balloon.
(d)	 Sugar reacted with warm air, which produced gas, 
eventually inflating the balloon.
(ii)	 She took another test tube, 1/4 filled with lime water. 
She  removed the balloon from test tube B in such a 
manner that the gas inside the balloon did not escape. 
She attached the balloon to the test tube with lime 
water and shook it well. What do you think she wants to 
find out?
