Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects
It was the day of the science exhibition, and the school was 
buzzing with energy. Mohini and Aakarsh, along with their 
friends, went from one exhibit to another, eagerly exploring 
different models, asking questions and taking notes. One simple 
model really fascinated them. It was a working model of a lifting 
electromagnet which was displayed by their senior, Sumana. 
In it, instead of a hook like a typical crane, there was an iron 
nail wrapped with a wire, which was connected to a battery. 
When Sumana closed the circuit, the nail picked up iron paper 
clips like a magnet. When she opened the circuit, the clips fell 
off. Mohini and Aakarsh, were surprised. They remembered 
learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’, Curiosity, 
Grade 6) that magnetic materials were attracted by magnet and 
that iron was a magnetic material. But in Sumana’s model, there 
was no magnet, only an electric circuit. They were so excited that 
they wanted to try it out themselves.
4.1 Does an Electric Current Have a Magnetic 
Effect? 
Activity 4.1: Let us investigate
	
z Collect a magnetic compass, an electric cell, a cell holder, 
two drawing pins, a safety pin, two nails, two pieces of 
connecting wires (one longer and one shorter), and two 
small pieces of cardboard. 
	
z Using two drawing pins, a safety pin, and a cardboard 
piece, make a switch (as you made it earlier in the 
chapter ‘Electricity: Circuits and their Components’ in 
Curiosity, Grade 7).
	
z Place the cell in the cell holder. 
	
z Fix two nails to a piece of cardboard as shown in 
Fig.  4.1a. Fix the middle portion of the longer wire 
stretched between the nails, such that it is slightly above 
the surface of the cardboard. Attach one end of that 
wire to the cell holder and another end to the switch.
	
z Connect the second wire between the cell holder and 
the switch.
	
z Place the magnetic compass beneath the wire between 
the two nails (Fig. 4.1a). 
Fig. 4.1: An electric circuit 
and a magnetic compass

Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
While watching the compass needle, move the switch to 
‘ON’ position to allow electric current to flow through the wire 
(Fig. 4.1b). What do you observe? 
	
z Now again while watching the compass needle, move the 
switch to ‘OFF’ position. What do you observe this time? 
	
z Move the switch between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ positions a few more 
times. Carefully observe how the compass needle behaves 
the each time.
You may have noticed that when the current flows, the compass 
needle gets deflected from its original direction. When the current 
stops, the needle returns to its original direction. 
As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ 
in Curiosity, Grade 6), the compass needle is a tiny magnet which 
deflects when a magnet is brought near it and this magnetic effect 
can act through any non-magnetic materials kept in between. 
But why does the compass needle deflect when the current 
flows through the wire? The deflection indicates that the current 
carrying wire has a magnetic effect on the compass needle. 
When the current stops, this magnetic effect disappears and 
the compass needle returns to its original direction. The region 
around a magnet or a current carrying wire where its magnetic 
effect can be felt, such as by the deflection of a compass needle, 
is said to have a magnetic field.
When 
electric 
current 
flows 
through a conductor (like a wire), it 
produces a magnetic field around it. 
This phenomenon is known as the 
magnetic effect of electric current. 
The magnetic field disappears when 
the current stops flowing.
Be a scientist 
You have just now made the same discovery which 
was made by the scientist Hans Christian Oersted 
(1777–1851) in 1820, that is, the discovery that 
electricity and magnetism are linked. He was a 
professor at a university in Denmark. It is said that 
once while giving a demonstration, he noticed that 
whenever an electrical circuit was closed or 
opened, the needle of a magnetic compass, lying 
nearby, deflected. He investigated this and when he was certain that 
an electric current indeed produced a magnetic field, he published 
his findings. This led to other scientists repeating his experiment to 
check if they got the same results, and further investigating the 
connection between electricity and magnetism. 
We have learnt about magnets 
and electric current in earlier 
grades. I used to think that there 
was no link between the two. But 
now we found that electricity 
and magnetic effect are linked!
Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects
The magnetic effect of electric current 
has many practical applications, such as 
in devices like electromagnets, electric 
bells, 
motors, 
fans, 
loudspeakers, 
and more. 
4.1.1 Electromagnets
Activity 4.2: Let us explore
	
z Take around 50 cm long length of a flexible 
insulated wire, an iron nail, an electric cell, and 
few iron paper clips.
	
z Tightly wrap the wire around the nail in the form 
of a coil, as shown in Fig. 4.2, and secure it with 
an adhesive tape.
	
z Connect the ends of the wire to the cell. Take care 
to not connect the wires to the cell for more than 
a few seconds; otherwise, the cell may weaken 
quickly. 
	
z Bring the nail close to the iron paper clips and 
lift up. Do the clips hang to the ends of the nail?
	
z Disconnect the wire from the cell to stop the 
flow of electric current in the wire. Do the clips 
fall down?
When electric current flows through the coil, the clips cling 
to it. But when the current is stopped, the clips no longer cling 
to it. Let us now try to investigate these observations in detail 
through Activity 4.3.
Activity 4.3: Let us experiment
	
z Take around 100 cm long flexible insulated wire, a piece 
of chart paper, an iron nail, an electric cell, two magnetic 
compasses, and few iron/steel paper clips.
	
z Roll a piece of chart paper to make a cylinder of diameter 
roughly equal to the width of a pencil. Secure it with an 
adhesive tape.
	
z Tightly wind around 50 turns of the insulated wire on the 
cylinder to form a cylindrical coil as shown in Fig.  4.3a. 
Secure the wire with an adhesive tape.
Fig. 4.3: (a) A coil 
of insulated wire
Can we use electric 
current to make a 
magnet?

z Place the compasses near the two ends of the 
cylindrical coil (Fig. 4.3b).
	
z Connect the two ends of the coil with the 
terminals of the cell as shown in Fig. 4.3c and 
observe the magnetic compasses. Do you find 
any deflection in the needles of the compasses?
	
z Disconnect the wire from the cell. Do the needles 
of the compasses come back to their original 
positions?
	
z Insert an iron nail in the paper cylinder (Fig. 4.3d) 
and repeat the steps. Is there any difference in 
the deflection of the compass needles?
	
z Place some iron paper clips near the two ends 
of the nail. Are the clips attracted to the ends of 
the nail?
It is observed that when current is passed through 
the cylindrical coil, it behaves like a magnet and 
deflects the needle of a magnetic compass. When an 
iron nail is inserted in the core of the coil, then the 
coil becomes a stronger magnet and the deflection of 
the magnetic compass needle is much more. It also 
attracts iron clips (Fig. 4.3e). When the current is 
stopped, the cylindrical coil loses its magnetic effect. 
A current carrying coil that behaves as a magnet is 
called an electromagnet. For practical applications, 
most electromagnets have an iron core to make them 
stronger.
Does electromagnet also have 
two poles like a bar magnet?
Activity 4.4: Let us investigate
	
z Take the electromagnet made in Activity 4.3 and a magnetic 
compass. Label the two ends of the coil as A and B.
	
z Place the magnetic compass near the end A of the coil as 
shown in Fig. 4.4a.
	
z Connect the coil to the cell and observe the compass. Note down 
which pole of the magnetic compass is attracted to end A.
Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects
As we have learnt earlier, when two magnets are brought close 
to each other, their unlike poles (North–South) attract each other. 
So, if north pole of the magnetic compass is attracted towards 
end A of the electromagnet, then end A is south pole.
	
z Repeat this procedure to find the polarity of end B as well 
(Fig. 4.4b). Did you find that the polarity of end B is opposite 
to the polarity of end A?
We learnt in grade 6 that a magnet has two poles. Just like a 
magnet, an electromagnet also has two poles — North and South.
Think like a scientist 
Repeat Activity 4.3 with — (i) 2 and 4 cells with the same coil, (ii) 2 cells but 
different number of turns of the coil. What do you observe?
A single cell provides only a small amount of current, so the magnetic 
field is weak. As a result, the deflection of compass needle is less and the coil 
can only attract a few clips. A battery with more cells gives a larger current 
as compared to that with a single cell. This creates a stronger magnetic field, 
so the deflection of the compass needle is more and the coil can attract 
more clips. The increase in number of turns of the coil also makes the coil a 
stronger magnet! 
Also, repeat Activity 4.4 by changing the direction of the current. 
So, the strength of an electromagnet can be changed by changing the amount 
of electric current flowing through the coil or the number of turns of the coil, 
or both. Also, its poles can be reversed by changing the direction of the current.
Do you remember learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring 
Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6) that a freely suspended magnet rests 
along the north–south direction because our Earth itself behaves 
like a giant magnet? But why does Earth behave like a magnet? Deep 
inside the Earth, the movement of liquid iron in the core creates 
electric currents, which generate a magnetic field. Many migratory 
birds, fish, and animals use this field to navigate across continents 
and oceans. The Earth’s magnetic field also acts as a shield, blocking 
harmful particles from space, and helps protect life on Earth.

4.1.2 Lifting electromagnets
Lifting 
electromagnets 
are 
strong 
electromagnets, that may be hung to the 
cranes. The crane operator can control the 
magnet by switching the current ON and OFF. When the current 
is turned ON, the electromagnet lifts the iron/steel objects; when 
the current is switched OFF, magnetic field disappears, and the 
objects are released. Lifting electromagnets are widely used in 
factories and scrap yards, to move, lift, and sort heavy metal 
items efficiently.
A step further
We have learnt that when electric current flows through a 
conductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it. In 
the higher grades, you will learn even more about this wonderful 
link between electricity and magnetism, including the exciting idea 
that just as electricity can produce magnetism, a moving magnet 
can also lead to an electric current. This deep connection between 
electricity and magnetism is vital to our daily lives, as it forms the 
basis of many devices, from electric motors to power generators.
4.2 Does a Current Carrying Wire Get Hot?
Activity 4.5: Let us observe
In this activity, we will use a special kind 
of wire, called a nichrome wire.
	
z Take a cardboard piece of about 10 cm 
length and 10 cm width, two nails, 
a nichrome wire of thickness about 
0.3  mm (26–28 gauge) and length of 
10 cm, an electric cell, a cell holder, a 
switch, and connecting wires. 
	
z Mount the nails on the cardboard about 5 cm apart.
	
z Tie the nichrome wire between these nails and make the 
connections as shown in Fig. 4.5 with the switch in OFF 
position.
	
z Touch the nichrome wire. What do you feel?
	
z Move the switch to ON position for about 30 s and then 
move it back to OFF. Touch the nichrome wire momentarily 
While doing the activity for 
electromagnet, did you also 
notice that the wire ends 
got warm? Why would that 
happen?
Are electromagnets also 
used in real life, for 
lifting objects?
Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects
(Do not hold the nichrome wire). 
What difference do you feel?
	
z Repeat the last two steps to 
confirm the observation.
You may have observed that nichrome wire 
feels warm when current is passed through it. 
This happens because, when electric current 
flows through any conductor, it faces some 
opposition or resistance to its flow. Different 
conductors offer different levels of resistance 
to the flow of current. A nichrome wire, for 
example, offers higher resistance compared to 
a copper wire of the same size and length. This 
resistance causes some of the electrical energy to 
be converted into heat energy. When an electric 
current passes through a conductor, it gets 
heated. This warming is known as the heating 
effect of electric current.
Think like a scientist 
This activity should be carried out strictly under the supervision 
of a teacher.
Repeat Activity 4.5 with a battery of 2 cells. What do you notice? 
For the same duration, does the wire heat up more with one cell or 
two cells?
The amount of heat generated is more in the experiment with 
2 cells. This is due to the fact that the heat generated depends on 
the magnitude of the electric current. The heat generated in a wire 
depends on the material, thickness, and length of the wire, and the 
duration for which the current flows. 
In Grade 7, we have learnt that an incandescent lamp glows 
because its filament is heated by an electric current. Many 
household appliances, such as electric room heaters, stoves, 
irons, 
immersion 
rods, 
water 
heaters, kettles, and hair dryers 
(Fig. 4.6) work on the same principle 
of the heating effect of electric 
current. All these devices contain a 
rod or a coil of wire, called a heating 
element. In some appliances where 
this element is visible, it can be seen glowing red hot.
Fig. 4.5: Heating effect in a wire
Oh, now I understand why 
the incandescent torch lamp 
sometimes used to get warm 
when we did the activity 
of making it glow using an 
electric cell.

Do not touch the wire for an extended 
period to avoid any injuries.
Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8
The heating effect of electric 
current is useful in many everyday 
appliances. But sometimes, it can 
cause problems, like energy loss 
in 
wires 
during 
transmission. 
Overheating in appliances may cause 
damage to plugs and sockets where 
plastic parts may melt, or even lead 
to fires. In household circuits, there 
are safety devices placed in the 
circuit to minimise such incidents.
Ever heard of ...
Beyond household use, heating effect of electric current has 
several industrial applications. One notable example is in 
steel manufacturing industries, where a specially designed 
high-temperature furnace (an enclosed space built to generate heat) 
uses electric current to produce heat. This is used to melt and 
recycle  scrap steel, converting it into usable steel.

To prevent unnecessary heating 
in household switchboards, it is 
important to use appropriate 
wires, plugs, and sockets that are 
rated for the specified electric 
current of the connections.

Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects
Yes, but have you ever wondered 
what is inside these cells and 
batteries that produces electricity?
The portable sources of electricity, 
such as cells and batteries, are so 
fascinating. Using these, we could 
light up a small lamp, make a magnet, 
and heat up a wire.
4.3 How Does a Battery Generate Electricity?
Let us start with one of the earliest types of electric cells ever made.
4.3.1 Voltaic cell
A Voltaic cell, also known as Galvanic cell, is 
shown in Fig. 4.7. It contains two metal plates 
made of different materials and a liquid called 
an electrolyte, placed in a glass or plastic 
container. The plates, called electrodes, are 
partly dipped in the electrolyte, which is usually 
a weak acid or salt solution. A chemical reaction 
between the plates and the electrolyte produces 
electricity. When the circuit is connected, 
electric current flows from the positive terminal 
through the circuit to the negative terminal. 
Over time, the chemicals get used up, and the 
cell stops working. It is then called ‘dead’ and 
cannot supply any more electricity. 
Ever heard of ...
The Voltaic or Galvanic cells get their names from two Italian 
scientists, Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani. In the late 1700s, 
Galvani noticed that a dead frog’s leg kicked when touched with 
two different metals — copper and iron. It was already known by 
then that electricity could stimulate muscular motion and Galvani 
thought the electricity came from the frog itself. But Volta had a 
different idea. He believed the electricity came from the metals, and 
not the frog. To test this, he used saltwater-soaked paper instead of 
the frog’s leg and still got an electric current. This showed that it 
was the combination of metals and liquid that generated electric 
current — leading to the invention of the first battery!

Activity 4.6: Let us construct 
	
z Take five or six juicy lemons, copper wires/
strips (1–2 mm thick) and iron nails. Also take 
one LED and some connecting wires.
	
z Insert the copper wire and the iron nail in one 
of the lemons keeping them apart by a small 
distance as shown in Fig. 4.8a. 
	
z Repeat the above step for all the remaining lemons.
	
z Join the copper wires and nails as shown in 
Fig. 4.8b.
	
z Connect the LED between the copper wire of the 
first lemon and the iron nail of the last lemon, using 
connecting wires. What do you observe? Does the 
LED glow?
	
z If the LED does not glow, 
reverse 
its 
connections. 
Does the LED glow now? 
[Remember that we have 
learnt earlier that current 
can pass through the LED 
only when the positive 
terminal (longer wire) of 
the LED is connected to 
the positive terminal of 
the battery, and negative 
terminal (shorter wire) of 
the LED is connected to the negative terminal of the battery].
A glowing LED indicates that your cell is working. In this cell, 
the metal electrodes are the copper wires and the iron nails. 
The electrolyte is the lemon juice, which helps conduct electricity. 
You may also use salt solutions instead of lemon juice.
A step further
Some common metal pairs for Voltaic cells are zinc/copper, zinc/
silver, aluminium/copper, iron/copper, magnesium/copper, and 
lead/copper. Some metals — like copper — act as positive electrodes, 
yet some other metals — like zinc — act as negative electrodes. This 
is due to their chemical properties. We will learn more about this 
in the higher grades.
Can we also make 
our own Voltaic 
cell using easily 
available materials?

Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects
4.3.2 Dry cells
Voltaic cells were an important discovery, but they are not 
convenient for everyday use. Instead, dry cells are one of the most 
widely used electric cells today. They are called 
‘dry’ because the electrolyte is not a liquid but 
a thick moist paste. The structure of a dry cell is 
shown in Fig. 4.9. It consists of a zinc container 
which acts as a negative terminal and a carbon 
rod at the centre covered with metal cap that 
acts as the positive terminal. The carbon rod is 
surrounded by the paste-like electrolyte.
The dry cell is a single use cell, meaning 
once it is used up, it has to be disposed of. 
For several applications, rechargeable batteries 
are increasingly being used now.
4.3.3 Rechargeable batteries
Rechargeable batteries can be recharged and reused multiple 
times. This prevents wastage and saves money over time as well.

phones; (c) Camera; (d) Inverter; (e) Vehicles; (f) Charging a mobile phone

Oh, so this is the reason 
why after a year or

requires charging more 
often!
There are many different kinds of rechargeable batteries that 
are used for different applications — from small batteries used 
in watches and phones to batteries used in 
laptops and tablet to bigger batteries that run 
inverters or drive electric vehicles (Fig. 4.10). 
However, rechargeable batteries also do not 
last forever. After being charged and used 
many times, they slowly wear out.

A step further
Today, the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is the most common type of 
rechargeable battery, found in almost all devices that use batteries. 
These batteries rely on special metals like lithium and cobalt, which 
are mined and processed in limited parts of the world. Because 
of this, countries are now racing to secure supplies, recycle old 
batteries, and develop new technologies.
Scientists are also working on the next big leap: solid-state 
batteries, which replace the liquid or paste-like electrolytes with 
solid materials. These future batteries would be much safer, charge 
faster and last longer. Improved rechargeable batteries are very 
important as the world moves to developing environmentally 
friendly sources of electrical power.

A step further
Even when a battery stops working, it is not completely ‘dead’. 
It could still contain materials like acids, and metals like lead, 
cadmium, nickel, or lithium, which may cause fires, or be harmful 
for the environment if the battery is thrown in regular garbage. 
Further, many materials used in these batteries are valuable and 
could be recycled and reused. These days, there are many places 
with special ‘e-waste’ recycling facilities, where used batteries can 
be disposed of. If you are not sure, ask your teacher. Recycling 
batteries is good for the planet and the people.
