They occur in everything that we do and see, from \nshopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to \nunderstanding weather patterns and using technology.\nThe search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun \nand creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians \nthink of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, we \nhope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry \ninvolved in discovering and understanding mathematical \npatterns.\nIt is important to keep in mind that mathematics \naims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the \nexplanations for why they exist. Such explanations can \noften then be used in applications well beyond the context in \nwhich they were discovered, which can then help to propel \nhumanity forward.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nFor example, the understanding of patterns in the motion of stars, \nplanets, and their satellites led humankind to develop the theory of \ngravitation, allowing us to launch our own satellites and send rockets \nto the Moon and to Mars; similarly, understanding patterns in genomes \nhas helped in diagnosing and curing diseases — among thousands of \nother such examples.\n  Figure it Out\n1.\t Can you think of other examples where mathematics helps \nus in our everyday lives?\n2.\t\nHow has mathematics helped propel humanity forward? (You \nmight think of examples involving: carrying out scientific \nexperiments; running our economy and democracy; building \nbridges, houses or other complex structures; making TVs, \nmobile phones, computers, bicycles, trains, cars, planes, \ncalendars, clocks, etc.)\n1.2 Patterns in Numbers\nAmong the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are \npatterns of numbers, particularly patterns of whole numbers:\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... \nThe branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in whole \nnumbers is called number theory.\nNumber sequences are the most basic and among the most \nfascinating types of patterns that mathematicians study. \nTable 1 shows some key number sequences that are studied in \nMathematics.\nMath \nTalk\nReprint 2025-26\nPatterns in Mathematics\nTable 1: Examples of number sequences\n\t\n1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...\t\n(All 1’s)\n\t\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...\t\n(Counting numbers)\n\t\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ... \t\n(Odd numbers)\n\t\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ...\t\n(Even numbers)\n\t\n1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ...\t\n(Triangular numbers)\n\t\n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, ... \t\n(Squares)\n\t\n1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ... \t\n(Cubes)\n\t\n1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... \t\n(Virahānka numbers)\n\t\n1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ... \t\n(Powers of 2)\n\t\n1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, ... \t\n(Powers of 3)\n  Figure it Out\n1. \t Can you recognise the pattern in each of the sequences in \nTable 1?\n2.\t Rewrite each sequence of Table 1 in your notebook, along \nwith the next three numbers in each sequence!

Do you think it will happen forever?\nThe answer is that the pattern does happen forever. But why? \nAs mentioned earlier, the reason why the pattern happens is just as \nimportant and exciting as the pattern itself.\nA picture can explain it\nVisualising with a picture can help explain the phenomenon. Recall \nthat square numbers are made by counting the number of dots in a \nsquare grid.\n  How can we partition the dots in a square grid into odd \nnumbers of dots: 1, 3, 5, 7,... ? \nThink about it for a moment before reading further!\nMath \nTalk\nReprint 2025-26\nPatterns in Mathematics\nHere is how it can be done:\nThis picture now makes it evident that \n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36.\nBecause such a picture can be made for a square of any size, this \nexplains why adding up odd numbers gives square numbers.\n  By drawing a similar picture, can you say what is the sum of the \nfirst 10 odd numbers? \n  Now by imagining a similar picture, or by drawing it partially, as \nneeded, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers?\nAnother example of such a relation between sequences: \nAdding up and down\nLet us look at the following pattern:\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1 = 1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1 + 2 + 1 = 4\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 25\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36 \nThis seems to be giving yet another way of getting the square numbers—\nby adding the counting numbers up and then down!\n...\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\n  Can you find a similar pictorial explanation?\n  Figure it Out\b\n1.\t Can you find a similar pictorial explanation for why adding \ncounting numbers up and down, i.e., 1, 1 + 2 + 1, 1 + 2 + 3 + \n2 + 1, …, gives square numbers?\n2.\t By imagining a large version of your picture, or drawing \nit partially, as needed, can you see what will be the value of \n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 99 + 100 + 99 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1?\n3.\t Which sequence do you get when you start to add the All 1’s \nsequence up?

These shapes may be in one, two, or three \ndimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D) — or in even more dimensions.  The \nbranch of Mathematics that studies patterns in shapes is called \ngeometry.\nShape sequences are one important type of shape pattern that \nmathematicians study.

Why or why \nnot? After each sequence, describe in your own words what \nis the rule or pattern for forming the shapes in the sequence.\n1.6 \tRelation to Number Sequences\nOften, shape sequences are related to number sequences in \nsurprising ways. Such relationships can be helpful in studying and \nunderstanding both the shape sequence and the related number \nsequence.\nExample: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular \nPolygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, \n7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular \ntriangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, \noctagon, nonagon, decagon, etc., respectively. \nThe word ‘regular’ refers to the fact that these shapes have \nequal-length sides and also equal ‘angles’ (i.e., the sides look the same \nand the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more \ndepth in the next chapter. \nThe other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful \nrelationships with number sequences.\n  Figure it Out\n1.\t Count the number of sides in each shape in the sequence \nof Regular Polygons. Which number sequence do you get? \nWhat about the number of corners in each shape in the \nsequence of Regular Polygons? Do you get the same number \nsequence? Can you explain why this happens?\n2.\t Count the number of lines in each shape in the sequence \nof Complete Graphs.

Which number sequence \ndoes this give? Can you explain why?\n4.\t\nHow many little triangles are there in each shape of the \nsequence of Stacked Triangles? Which number sequence \ndoes this give? Can you explain why? (Hint: In each shape in \nthe sequence, how many triangles are there in each row?)\n5.\t To get from one shape to the next shape in the Koch \nSnowflake sequence, one replaces each line segment­ ‘—’ \nby a ‘speed bump’ \n. As one does this more and more \ntimes, the changes become tinier and tinier with very very \nsmall line segments. How many total line segments are \nthere in each shape of the Koch Snowflake? What is the \ncorresponding number sequence? (The answer is 3, 12, 48, ..., \ni.e., 3 times Powers of 4; this sequence is not shown in Table 1.)\nS u m m a r y\n\u001f\n\u001f\nMathematics may be viewed as the search for patterns and for the \nexplanations as to why those patterns exist.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nAmong the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are number \nsequences.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nSome important examples of number sequences include the counting \nnumbers, odd numbers, even numbers, square numbers, triangular \nnumbers, cube numbers, Virahānka numbers, and powers of 2.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nSometimes number sequences can be related to each other in beautiful \nand remarkable ways. For example, adding up the sequence of odd \nnumbers starting with 1 gives square numbers. \n\u001f\n\u001f\nVisualising number sequences using pictures can help to understand \nsequences and the relationships between them.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nShape sequences are another basic type of pattern in mathematics. \nSome important examples of shape sequences include regular polygons, \ncomplete graphs, stacked triangles and squares, and Koch snowflake \niterations.

For example, \nthere is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before \n1.  The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the \nworld.

These are called \nfractions.\nBut are there still more numbers? Well, 0 is an additional number \nthat we didn’t know about earlier, and it comes before 1 and is less \nthan 1.

Can you spot the lift?\nTo go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you \nmust press the ‘+’ button twice. \nWe say that the button press is + + or + 2.\nTo go down two floors, you must press the ‘–’ \nbutton twice, which we write as – – or – 2.\nSo if you press + 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘+’ \nbutton once), then you will go up one floor and if \nyou press – 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘–’ button \nonce), then you will go down 1 floor.\nLift button presses and numbers:\n+++ is written as + 3\n – – – – is written as –  4\n What do you press to go four floors up? \nWhat do you press to go three floors down?\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nNumbering the floors in the building of fun\nEntry to the ‘Building of Fun’ is at the ground floor level and is called \nthe ‘Welcome Hall’. Starting from the ground floor, you can reach the \nFood Court by pressing + 1 and can reach the Art Centre by pressing \n+ 2. So, we can say that the Food Court is on Floor + 1 and that the Art \nCentre is on Floor + 2.\nStarting from the ground floor, you must press – 1 to reach the Toy \nStore. So, the Toy Store is on Floor – 1 similarly starting from the ground \nfloor, you must press – 2 to reach the Video Games shop. So, the Video \nGames shop is on Floor – 2.\nThe ground floor is called Floor 0. Can you see why?\n  Number all the floors in the Building of Fun.\nDid you notice that + 3 is the floor number of the Book \nStore, but it is also the number of floors you move \nwhen you press + 3? Similarly,  – 3 is the floor number \nbut it is also the number of floors you go down when \nyou press – 3, i.e., when you press – – – .\nA number with a ‘+’ sign in front is called a positive \nnumber. A number with a ‘–’ sign in front is called a \nnegative number. \nIn the ‘Building of Fun’, the floors are numbered \nusing the ground floor, Floor 0, as a reference or starting \npoint. The floors above the ground floor are numbered \nwith positive numbers. To get to them from the ground \nfloor, one must press the ‘+’ button some number of \ntimes. The floors below the ground are numbered with \nnegative numbers. To get to them from the ground floor, \none must press the ‘–’ button some number of times.\nZero is neither a positive nor a negative number. \nWe do not put a ‘+’ or ‘–’ sign in front of it.\nReprint 2025-26\nThe Other Side of Zero\nAddition to keep track of movement\nStart from the Food Court and press + 2 in the lift. Where will you \nreach? ____________\nWe can describe this using an expression:\nStarting Floor + Movement = Target Floor.\nThe starting floor is + 1 (Food Court) and the number of button \npresses is + 2. Therefore,  you reach the target floor (+ 1) + (+ 2) = + 3 \n(Book Store).\n Figure it Out\n1.\t \u0007You start from Floor + 2 and press – 3 in the lift. Where will you \nreach?

What can he do to cancel it and \nstay on the ground floor? He can cancel it by pressing \n– 3. That is, (+3) + (– 3) = 0.\nWe call – 3 the inverse of +3. Similarly, the inverse of \n– 3 is +3.\nIf Basant now presses +4 and then presses – 4 in the \nlift, where will he reach?\nHere is another way to think of the concept of \ninverse. If you are at Floor +4 and you press its inverse \n– 4, then you are back to zero, the ground floor! If you \nare at Floor – 2 and press its inverse +2, then you go to \n(– 2) + (+2) = 0, again the ground floor!\n  \u0007Write the inverses of these numbers: \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n+4, –4, –3, 0, +2, –1.\n  \u0007Connect the inverses by drawing lines.\n+9\n+7\n–8\n–5\n–7\n+8\n+5\n–9\nComparing numbers using floors\n Who is on the lowest floor? \n1.\t Jay is in the Art Centre.

For example, there are 10 books on the shelf. I take away 4 \nbooks. How many are left on the shelf?\nWe can express the answer using subtraction: 10 – 4 = 6 or ‘Ten \ntake away four is six.’\n+1\nE\nF\nG\nH\nD\nC\nB\nA\n–1\n–12\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nYou may also be familiar with another meaning of subtraction which \nis related to comparison or making quantities equal. For example, \nconsider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6.\nNow, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my \nsister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ\nWe can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10   Or   10 – 6 = ?\nHere, we see the connection between ‘finding the missing number \nto be added’ and subtraction.\nFor subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use \nthis meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing \nnumber to be added’.\n  \u0007Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective. \nIn general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can \nindicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction \nshows how much the starting quantity should change in order to \nbecome the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels, \nwhat is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting \nFloor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) \nor negative (for a decrease).\nTeacher’s Note\nYour starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the \nSports Centre. What should be your button press?\nYou need to go three floors up, so you should press + 3. We can \nwrite this as an expression using subtraction: \nTarget Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed.\nIn the above example, the starting floor is + 2 (Art Centre) and \nthe target floor is + 5. The button press to get to + 5 from + 2 is + 3. \nTherefore, \n(+ 5) – (+ 2) = + 3\nReprint 2025-26\nThe Other Side of Zero\nExplanation \nRecall the connection between addition and subtraction. For 3 + ? = 5, \nwe can find the missing number using subtraction: 5 – 3 = 2. That is, \nsubtraction is the same as finding the missing number to be added. \nWe know that —\nStarting Floor + Movement needed = Target Floor\nIf the movement needed is to be found, then,\nStarting Floor + ? = Target Floor\nSo, \nTarget Floor – Starting Floor = ? = Movement needed\nMore examples:\na.\tIf the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting Floor is – 2, what button \nshould you press?  \n\t\nYou need to go one floor up, so, you should press + 1. \n\t\nExpression:  (– 1) – (– 2) = (+1)\nb.\tIf the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting floor is +3, what button \nshould you press?  \n\t\nYou need to go four floors down, so, you should press – 4. \n\t\nExpression:  (– 1) – (+ 3) = (– 4)\nc.\t If the Target Floor is +2 and Starting Floor is – 2,  what button \nshould you press?  \n\t\nYou need to go four floors up, so, you should press +4. \n\t\nExpression:  (+ 2) – (– 2) = (+ 4)\n \u0007Figure it Out\n\t\n\u0007Complete these expressions.

The truck is at the ground level, but \nthe minerals are present both above and \nbelow the ground level. There is a fast \nmoving lift which moves up and down in \na mineshaft carrying people and ore. \nSome of the levels are marked in the \npicture. The ground level is marked 0. \nLevels above the ground are marked by \npositive numbers and levels below the \nground are marked by negative numbers. \nThe number indicates how many metres \nabove or below the ground level it is.\nIn the mine, just like in the Building of Fun:\nStarting Level + Movement = Target Level\nFor example,\n(+ 40) + (+ 60) = + 100\t \t\n(– 90) + (– 55) = – 145\nTarget Level – Starting Level = Movement needed\nFor example,\n(+ 40) – (– 50) = + 90 \t\n\t\n(– 90) – (+ 40) = – 130\nHow many negative numbers are there?\nBela’s Building of Fun had only six floors above and five floors below. \nThat is numbers – 5 to + 6. In the mine above, we have numbers from \n– 200 to + 180. But we can imagine larger buildings or mineshafts. \nJust as positive numbers + 1, + 2, + 3, ... keep going up without an end, \nsimilarly, negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, ... keep going down. Positive \nand negative numbers, with zero, are called integers.

In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards \nand forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even \nhave to be any building or mine around — just an ‘infinite lift’! \nWe can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like.\nFor example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000 \n– (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground \nand 200 below the ground. Recall that,\nTarget Level – Starting Level = Movement needed\nTo go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we \nmust press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after \nthat to get to + 2200).

In other words, subtracting a negative number is the same \nas adding the corresponding positive number. That is, we can \nreplace subtraction of a negative number by addition of a positive \nnumber!\n In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice \nthat subtracting a negative number was the same as adding \nthe corresponding positive number?\nTake a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you \nof a number line?  In what ways?\nBack to the number line\nThe ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line, \ndidn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number \nline. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line, \nanswering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the \nchapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, … \nUsually we drop the ‘+’ sign on positive numbers and simply write \nthem as 1, 2, 3, … \n– 10 – 9\n– 8\n– 7\n– 6\n– 5\n– 4\n– 3\n– 2\n– 1\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\nInstead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can \nsimply imagine walking on it. To the right is the positive (forward) \ndirection, and to the left is the negative (backward) direction. \nSmaller numbers are now to the left of bigger numbers and \nbigger numbers are to the right of smaller numbers. So, 2 < 5; \n– 3 < 2; and – 5 < – 3. \n If, from 5 you wish to go over to 9, how far must you travel along \nthe number line?\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nMath \nTalk\nReprint 2025-26\nThe Other Side of Zero\nYou must travel 4 steps. That is why 5 + 4 = 9. \n(Remember: Starting Number + Movement = Target Number)\nThe corresponding subtraction statement is 9 – 5 = 4. \n(Remember: \u0007Target Number – Starting Number = Movement \nneeded)\n Now, from 9, if you wish to go to 3, how much must you travel \nalong the number line? \n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\nYou must move 6 steps backward, i.e., you must move –6. Hence, \nwe write 9 + (–6) = 3.  \n(Remember again : \u0007Starting Number + Movement = Target \nNumber) \nThe corresponding subtraction statement is 3 – 9 = – 6.  \n(Remember again:  \u0007Target Number – Starting Number = Movement \nneeded)\n Now, from 3, if you wish to go to – 2, how far must you travel?\n– 10 – 9\n– 8\n– 7\n– 6\n– 5\n– 4\n– 3\n– 2\n– 1\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\nYou must travel – 5 steps, i.e., 5 steps backward.

Other numbers are not \nmarked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to \nadd and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale \nof the number line and the positions of numbers on it.\nFor example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the \naddition problem: 85 + (– 60) = ? \n  \n+85\n+25\n– 60\nWe then can visualise that 85 + (– 60) = 25\nThe following UNL shows a subtraction problem which can also be \nwritten as a missing addend problem: (– 100) – (+ 250) = ? or 250 + ? = – 100. \n+ 250\n– 100\n?\nWe can then visualise that ? = –350 in this problem.\nIn this way, you can carry out addition and subtraction problems, \nwith positive and negative numbers, on paper or in your head using an \nunmarked number line.\nReprint 2025-26\nThe Other Side of Zero\n  Use unmarked number lines to evaluate these expressions: \na.\t – 125 + (– 30) = _______\nb.\t + 105 –  (– 55) = _______\nc.\t + 80 – (– 150) = _______\nd.\t – 99 – (– 200) = _______\nConverting subtraction to addition and addition to subtraction\nRecall that\t Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed \nor\nTarget Floor = Starting Floor + Movement needed\nIf we start at 2 and wish to go to – 3, what is the movement needed? \nFirst method: Looking at the number line, we see we need to \nmove – 5 (i.e., 5 in the backward direction). Therefore, – 3 – 2 = – 5. \nThe movement needed is –5.\nSecond method: Break the journey from 2 to –3 into two parts. \na.\t From 2 to 0, the movement is 0 – 2 = – 2. \nb.\t From 0 to –3, the movement is – 3 – 0 = – 3.\nThe total movement is the sum of the two movements: – 3 + (– 2) = – 5.\nLook at the two coloured expressions. There is no subtraction in \nthe second one!\nIn this way, we can always convert subtraction to addition. The \nnumber that is being subtracted can be replaced by its inverse \nand then added instead.\nSimilarly, a number that is being added can be replaced by \nits inverse and then subtracted.  In this way, we can also always \nconvert addition to subtraction.\nExamples:\t\na.\t (+ 7) – (+ 5) = (+ 7) + (– 5)\nb.\t (– 3) – (+ 8) = (– 3) + (– 8)\nc.\t (+ 8) – (– 2) = (+ 8) + (+ 2)\nd.\t (+ 6) – (– 9) = (+ 6) + (+ 9)\n– 3\n2\n– 5\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\n10.2 The Token Model\nUsing tokens for addition\nIn Bela’s Building of Fun, the lift attendant is bored. To entertain \nhimself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative \n(green) tokens. Each time he presses the ‘+’ button, he takes a \npositive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly, \neach time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and \nputs it in his pocket. \nHe starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After \none hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative \ntokens. On which floor is he now? \nHe must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2. \nSo, he is at Floor + 2 now. \nHere is another way to do the calculation.\nA positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because \nthe value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in \nhis pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively, \nand these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative \ntoken make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are \nleft with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2. \nWe can perform any such addition using tokens! \nExample: Add + 5 and – 8. \nReprint 2025-26\nThe Other Side of Zero\nFrom the picture, we see that we can remove five zero pairs, and we \nare then left with – 3.

We can also perform subtraction using \ntokens!\nExample: Let us subtract:  \n(+5) – (+4).\nThis is easy to do. From 5 positives \ntake away 4 positives to see the result.\nExample: Let us subtract:  \n(–7) – (–5).\nIs (– 7) – (– 5) the same as (– 7) + (+ 5)?\nExample: Let us subtract: (+ 5) – (+ 6).\nPut down 5 positives.\nBut there are not enough tokens to take out 6 positives!\n(+ 5) – (+ 4) = + 1\n(–7) – (–5) = –2\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nTo get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a \npositive and a negative), knowing that this does not change the value \nof the set of tokens.\nNow, we can take out 6 positives! \nSee what is left:\nWe conclude that (+5) – (+6) = – 1.\n Figure it Out\n\u00071.\t\nEvaluate the following differences using tokens.

In one of China’s most \nimportant mathematical works, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical \nArt (Jiuzhang Suanshu)—which was completed by the first or second \ncentury CE—positive and negative numbers were represented using \nred and black rods, much like the way we represented them using \ngreen and red tokens!\nReprint 2025-26\nThe Other Side of Zero\nThere was a strong culture of accountancy also in India in ancient \ntimes. The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively \nby Kautilya in his Arthaśhāstra (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition \nthat an account balance could be negative. The explicit use of negative \nnumbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient \nIndian works, including in the Bakśhālī manuscript from around the \nyear 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special \nsymbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as \nwe do today).\nThe first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, \nand zero — all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on \nwhich one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, \nmultiplication, and even division — was given by Brahmagupta in \nhis Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave \nclear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers — positive, \nnegative, and zero — that essentially formed the modern way of \nunderstanding these numbers that we still use today!\nSome of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of \npositive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below:\nBrahmagupta’s Rules for Addition (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta \n18.30, 628 CE)\n1.\t\nThe sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). \n2.\t The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add \nthe numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to \nobtain the result (e.g., (– 2) + (– 3) = – 5).\n3.\t\nTo add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the \nsmaller number (without the sign) from the greater number \n(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to \nobtain the result (e.g., –  5 + 3 = – 2,  2 + (– 3) = – 1 and – 3 + 5 = 2).\n4.\t The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0). \n5.\t\nThe sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 \n= – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0).\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nBrahmagupta’s Rules for Subtraction (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta \n18.31-18.32)\n1.\t\nIf a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result \nis positive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1). \n2.\t If a larger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result \nis negative (e.g., 2– 3 = – 1).\n3.\t\nSubtracting a negative number is the same as adding the \ncorresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – (– 3) = 2 + 3).\n4.\t Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and – 2 – \n(– 2) = 0).\n5.\t\nSubtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2 \n– 0 = – 2 and 0 –  0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the \nnumber’s inverse (e.g., 0 –  (– 2) = 2).\nOnce you understand Brahmagupta’s rules, you can do addition \nand subtraction with any numbers whatsoever — positive, negative, \nand zero!\n \u0007Figure it Out\n1.\t\nCan you explain each of Brahmagupta’s rules in terms of Bela’s \nBuilding of Fun, or in terms of a number line? \n2.\t Give your own examples of each rule.\nBrahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on \nan equal  footing with positive numbers as well as with negative \nnumbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic \noperations on all such numbers, positive, negative, and zero—forming \nwhat is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does \nmathematics.\nHowever, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to \nadopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers \nwere transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab \nworld by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the \n13th century. \nReprint 2025-26\nThe Other Side of Zero\nSurprisingly, negative numbers were still not accepted by many \nEuropean mathematicians even in the 18th century. Lazare Carnot, a \nFrench mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers \n‘absurd’.  But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved \nto be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are \nnow considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with \nand as important as positive numbers — just as Brahmagupta had \nrecommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE! \nThis abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way \nfor the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about \nin future classes.\nSu m m a r y\n\u001f\n\u001f\nThere are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ‘–’ \nsign in front of them (e.g., – 2), and are called negative numbers.

The \nnumbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers  and the numbers …, \n– 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive \nnor negative.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nEvery given number has another number associated to it which when \nadded to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive \ninverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and \nthe additive inverse of – 543 is 543.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nAddition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target \nPosition.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nAddition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or \nincreases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nSubtraction can be interpreted as Target Position – Starting Position \n= Movement.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\n\u001f\n\u001f\nIn general, we can add two numbers by following Brahmagupta’s Rules \nfor Addition:\na.\t If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a \npositive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).\nb.\t If both numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs), \nand then place a minus sign to obtain the result (– 2 + (– 3) = – 5).\nc.\t If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the \nsmaller number (without the sign) from the greater number \n(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to \nobtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2).\nd.\t A number plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0).\ne.\t A number plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2).\n\u001f\n\u001f\nWe can subtract two integers by converting the problem into an addition \nproblem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an \ninteger is the same as the addition of its additive inverse. \n\u001f\n\u001f\nIntegers can be compared: … – 3 < – 2 < – 1 < 0 < +1 < +2 < +3 < ... Smaller \nnumbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nWe can give meaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting \nthem as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers \nas distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly, \nnegative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground \nlevel. When measuring temperatures in degrees Celsius, positive \ntemperatures are those above the freezing point of water, and negative \ntemperatures are those below the freezing point of water.\nReprint 2025-26\nThe Other Side of Zero\nIntegers: Snakes and Ladders\nRules\n•\t This is a two player game.

The sharper the \ntip, the thinner will be the dot. This tiny dot will give you an idea of \na point. A point determines a precise location, but it has no length, \nbreadth or height.

These points are read as ‘Point Z’, ‘Point P’ and ‘Point T’. Of \ncourse, the dots represent precise locations and must be imagined to be \ninvisibly thin.\n 2.2 Line Segment\nFold a piece of paper and unfold it. Do you \nsee a crease? This gives the idea of a line \nsegment. It has two end points, A and B.\nMark any two points A and B on a sheet of \npaper. Try to connect A to B by various \nroutes  (Fig. 2.1).\nWhat is the shortest route from A to B? \nThis shortest path from point A to Point B \n(including A and B) as shown here is called \nthe line segment from A to B. It is denoted by \neither AB or BA. The points A and B are called \nthe end points of the line segment AB.\n 2.3 Line\nImagine that the line segment from A to B (i.e., \nAB) is extended beyond A in one direction and \nbeyond B in the other direction without any \nend (see Fig. 2.2). This is a model for a line. Do \nyou think you can draw a complete picture of \na line? No. Why?\nA line through two points A and B is written as AB. It extends \nforever in both directions.

Here is an angle \nformed by rays BD  and BE  where B is \nthe common starting point (Fig. 2.8).\nThe point B is called the vertex of the \nangle, and the rays BD  and BE  are called \nthe arms of the angle. How can we name \nthis angle? We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle B. \nTo be clearer, we use a point on each of the arms together with the \nvertex to name the angle. In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE \nor Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠’, i.e., \n∠DBE or ∠EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always \nwritten as the middle letter.\nTo indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer \nto Fig. 2.9).\nVidya has just opened her book.

Can you mark \ntheir arms and vertex?\nWhich angle is greater—the angle in Case 1 or the angle in Case 2? \nJust as we talk about the size of a line based on its length, we also \ntalk about the size of an angle based on its amount of rotation. \nSo, the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate \nthe cover more. Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that \nof Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6 \nare successively larger angles with more and more rotation.\nThe size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed \nabout the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray. \nFig. 2.9\nFinal position of ray\nAmount of turn is the size of \nthe angle\nVertex\nInitial position of ray\nLet’s look at some other examples where angles arise in real life \nby rotation or turn:\b\n•\t In a compass or divider, we turn the arms to form \nan angle.

While superimposing, the vertices of the \nangles must overlap.\nAfter superimposition, it becomes clear which angle is smaller \nand which is larger. \nB\nA\nC\nQ\nP\nR\nQ (B)\nP\nA\nC\nR\nThe picture shows the two angles superimposed.

So, the angles are equal in size.\nThe reason these angles are considered to be equal in size is \nbecause when we visualise each of these angles as being formed out \nof rotation, we can see that there is an equal amount of rotation \nneeded to move  OB to OA  and OY  to OX.\nFrom the point of view of superimposition, when two angles \nare superimposed, and the common vertex and the two rays of \nboth angles lie on top of each other, then the sizes of the angles \nare equal.  \nReprint 2025-26\nLines and Angles\n Where else do we use superimposition to compare?\n Figure it Out\b\n1.\t Fold a rectangular sheet of paper, then draw a line along the fold \ncreated.

But can we do it without superimposition?\nSuppose we have a transparent circle which can be moved and \nplaced on figures. Can we use this for comparison? \nLet us place the circular paper on the angle made by the first \ncrane. The circle is placed in such a way that its centre is on the \nvertex of the angle.

Can you identify \nwhich of the rotating arms will pass through the slit? \nThe correct one can be found by placing each of the rotating arms \nover the slit. Let us do this for some of the rotating arms:\nSlit angle is greater than \nthe arms’ angle. The arms \nwill not go through the \nslit. \nSlit angle is less than the \narms’ angle. The arms \nwill not go through the \nslit.\nSlit angle is equal to the \narms’ angle. The arms will \ngo through the slit. \nOnly the pair of rotating arms where the angle is equal to that of the \nslit passes through the slit. Note that the possibility of passing through \nthe slit depends only on the angle between the rotating arms and not \non their lengths (as long as they are shorter than the length of the slit).\nReprint 2025-26\nLines and Angles\nChallenge: Reduce \nthis angle. \nAngle \nreduced.\nThe angle is still \nthe same!\n2.8 Special Types of Angles\nLet us go back to Vidya’s \nnotebook and observe her \nopening the cover of the book \nin different scenarios. \nShe makes a full turn of the \ncover when she has to write \nwhile holding the book in \nher hand. \nShe makes a half turn of the \ncover when she has to open \nit on her table. In this case, \nobserve the arms of the angle formed. They lie in a straight line. \nSuch an angle is called a straight angle. \nA\nO\nB\nLet us consider a straight angle ∠AOB. Observe that any ray OC \ndivides it into two angles, ∠AOC and ∠COB.\nFig. 2.11\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\n  Is it possible to draw OC such that the two angles are \nequal to each other in size? \nLet’s Explore\nWe can try to solve this problem using a piece of paper. Recall that when \na fold is made, it creates a crease which is straight.\nTake a rectangular piece of paper and on one of its sides, mark \nthe straight angle AOB. By folding, try to get a line (crease) passing \nthrough O that divides ∠AOB into two equal angles.\nHow can it be done? \nFold the paper such that OB overlaps with OA. Observe the crease \nand the two angles formed.\nMath \nTalk\nReprint 2025-26\nLines and Angles\nJustify why the two angles are equal. Is there a way to \nsuperimpose and check? Can this superimposition be done by \nfolding? \nEach of these equal angles formed are called right angles. So, a \nstraight angle contains two right angles.\nWhy shouldn't you \nargue with a 90 ̊ \nangle?\nBecause they're \nalways right.\n If a straight angle is formed by half of a full turn, how much of a \nfull turn will form a right angle? \b\nObserve that a right angle resembles the shape of an ‘L’. An angle \nis a right angle only if it is exactly half of a straight angle. Two lines \nthat meet at right angles are called perpendicular lines.\n Figure it Out\b\n1.\t How many right angles do the windows of your classroom \ncontain?

Right angles \nare shown in the second group. What could be the common feature \nof the other two groups?\nIn the first group, all angles are less than a right angle or in other \nwords, less than a quarter turn. Such angles are called acute angles.\nIn the third group, all angles are greater than a right angle but \nless than a straight angle. The turning is more than a quarter turn \nand less than a half turn. Such angles are called obtuse angles.\n\t Figure it Out\n1.\t\nIdentify acute, right, obtuse and straight angles in the previous \nfigures.\n2.\t\nMake a few acute angles and a few obtuse angles.

But can we actually \nquantify how big an angle is using a number without having to \ncompare it to another angle?\nWe saw how various angles can be compared using a circle. \nPerhaps a circle could be used to assign measures for angles?\nFig. 2.12\nTo assign precise measures to angles, mathematicians came up \nwith an idea. They divided the angle in the centre of the circle into \nReprint 2025-26\nLines and Angles\n360 equal angles or parts. The angle measure of each of these unit \nparts is 1 degree, which is written as 1°.\nThis unit part is used to assign measure to any angle: the measure \nof an angle is the number of 1° unit parts it contains inside it. \nFor example, see this figure:\n30 units\nIt contains 30 units of 1° angle and so we say that its angle measure is 30°.\nMeasures of different angles: What is the measure of a full turn in \ndegrees? As we have taken it to contain 360 degrees, its measure is 360°.\n  What is the measure of a straight angle in degrees? A straight \nangle is half of a full turn. As a full-turn is 360°, a half turn is 180°.\nWhat is the measure of a right angle in degrees? Two right angles \ntogether form a straight angle. As a straight angle measures 180°, a \nright angle measures 90°.\nA\nO\n180 units\n90 units\nB\nA\nO\nB\nA\nO\nB\nA\nO\nB\nA pinch of history\nA full turn has been divided into 360°. Why 360? The reason why \nwe use 360° today is not fully known. The division of a circle into \nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\n360 parts goes back to ancient times. The Rigveda, one of the very \noldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of \na wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars, \nalso going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia, \nBabylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In \naddition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60 \nand 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s. \nPerhaps the most important and practical answer for why \nmathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360 \ndegrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided \nby all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the \ncircle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole \nnumber of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible \nby 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of \nhours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful. \n The circle has been divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 10 and 12 parts \nbelow. What are the degree measures of the resulting angles? Write \nthe degree measures down near the indicated angles.\nDegree measures of different angles\nHow can we measure other angles in degrees? It is for this purpose \nthat we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided \ninto 360 equal parts as shown in Fig. 2.12 (on page 32), or a half \ncircle divided into 180 equal parts.\nReprint 2025-26\nLines and Angles\nUnlabelled protractor\nHere is a protractor. Do you see the straight angle at the center \ndivided into 180 units of 1 \ndegree? Only part of the \nlines dividing the straight \nangle are visible, though!  \nStarting \nfrom \nthe \nmarking on the rightmost \npoint of the base, there \nis a long mark for every \n10°. From every such long \nmark, there is a medium \nsized mark after 5°.\n Figure it out\n1.\t\nWrite the measures of the \nfollowing angles:\na. ∠ KAL \nNotice that the vertex of this \nangle coincides with the centre of \nthe protractor.

See what your classmates have listed, share, and discuss. \nAns. \nFive different possible situations in which numbers are used - \n1. \nTime  \n2. \nCalendar \n3. \nCounting objects/Marks \n4. \nMeasurement of height & weight  \n5. \nMoney  \nThere could many more. \n \nSection 3.1  \nPage No. 55  \nQ. What do you think these numbers mean? \nAns. \nRefer page 56. \n  Page No. 56 \nQ1. Can the children rearrange themselves so that the children standing at the ends say \n‘2’? \nAns. No; There will be no one standing on the other side of the child standing at the end.  \nQ2. Can we arrange the children in a line so that all would say only 0s? \nAns. Yes; All the children in the line should be of same height.  \nQ3. Can two children standing next to each other say the same number? \nAns. Yes; Refer picture on page 55.  \nQ4. There are 5 children in a group, all of different heights. Can they stand such that four \nof them say ‘1’ and the last one says ‘0’? Why or why not? \nAns. Yes, they can, if they are standing in ascending order of height.  \n                                     \n \n \n[2] \n \nQ5. For this group of 5 children, is the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 possible? \nAns. \nNo; the tallest child at the end cannot say1. \n \nQ6. Is the sequence 0, 1, 2, 1, 0 possible? Why or why not?  \nAns. \nYes, it is possible.  \n  \nQ7. How would you rearrange the five children so that the maximum number of children \nsay ‘2’? \nAns. \nAt the most only 2 children can say 2 as given is the following arrangement.  \n  \nSection 3.2  \nPage No. 57 \nFigure it out  \nQ1.

Out of the 9 numbers, how many supercells are there in the table above? ___________ \nAns. 5  \nQ5 Find out how many supercells are possible for different numbers of cells. \nDo you notice any pattern? What is the method to fill a given table to get the \nmaximum number of supercells? Explore and share your strategy. \nAns. \nFor even number of cells say,2,4,6,… the number of supercells would be respectively, \n                2/2 =1,4/2 =2,6/2=3,… \nFor odd number of cells , say 1,3,5,7,… the number of supercells would be respectively  \n(1+1)/2= 1, (3+1)/2 = 2, (5+1)/2= 3,(7+1)/2 = 4,… \nTo get the maximum number ofsupercells, we have to start by filling the first cell as \nsuper cell & then fill alternately.  \nQ6. Can you fill a supercell table without repeating numbers such that there are no \nsupercells? Why or why not? \nAns. No; the cell which is filled by the greatest number among the given numbers chosen, will \nbecome super cell irrespective of its position in the table.  \nQ7. Will the cell having the largest number in a table always be a supercell? Can the cell \nhaving the smallest number in a table be a supercell? Why or why not? \nAns. \nYes, the largest number in a table will always be a supercell.  \nNo, the smallest number in a table can never be a supercell as the number in all the \nadjacent cells will be greater than it. \nQ8. Fill a table such that the cell having the second largest number is not a supercell. \nAns. \nOne of the ways could be- \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 8 \n \n110 \n100 \n150 \n130 \n280 \n200 \n230 \n210 \n270 \n[4] \n \nQ9.

As we saw in \npictographs, we can use a scale or key when the frequencies are larger. \n\t\nLet us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing \nin Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day. \nThe number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from \n6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph.

Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown \nby the smallest bar, i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During \nthat time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The \nsecond smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon, \nwhen about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing.\n\t\nThe total number of cars passing through the crossing during the \ntwo-hour interval 8.00–10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about \n1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\b\n Figure it Out\n1.\t \u0007How many total cars passed through the crossing between 6 a.m. \nand noon?\b\n2.\t \u0007Why do you think so little traffic occurred during the hour of \n6–7 a.m., as compared to the other hours from 7 a.m.–noon?\n3.\t \u0007Why do you think the traffic was the heaviest between 7–8 a.m.?\n4.\t Why do you think the traffic was lesser and lesser each hour after \n8 a.m. all the way until noon?\nExample:\nYears\nPopulation of India in crores\n36\n54\n84\n1951\n1971\n1991\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\nPopulation of India in crores\nThis bar graph shows the population of India in each decade over a \nperiod of 50 years.

Therefore, we choose the scale so that 1 unit represents \n10 crores. The bar graph for this choice is shown in the figure. So a \nbar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents \n80 crores.\n••\nOn the basis of this bar graph, what may be a few questions you \nmay ask your friends?\n••\nHow much did the population of India increase over 50 years? \nHow much did the population increase in each decade?\n4.4 Drawing a Bar Graph\nIn a previous example, Shri Nilesh prepared a frequency table \nrepresenting the sweet preferences of the students in his class. Let’s \ntry to prepare a bar graph to present his data —\n1.\t\n\u0007First, we draw a horizontal \nline and a vertical line. On \nthe horizontal line, we will \nwrite the name of each of \nthe sweets, equally spaced, \nfrom which the bars will \nrise in accordance with \ntheir frequencies; and on \nthe vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the \nnumber of students. \n2.\t\nWe must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many \nstudents will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that \nit fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to \nrepresent 1 student. \n3.\t\nFor jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 \nunits (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly \nfor the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their \nfrequencies. \nSweet\nNo. of Students\nJalebi\nGulab jamun\nGujiya\nBarfi \nRasgulla\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\b\n4.\t\nWe, therefore, get a bar graph as shown below —\nSweets\nSweet preferences of students\n13\n11\n9\n7\n5\n3\n1\nNumber of students\nJalebi\nGulab jamun\nGujia \nBarfi\nRasgulla\n\t\nWhen the frequencies are larger and we cannot use the scale of \n1 unit length = 1 number (frequency), we need to choose a different \nscale like we did in the case of pictographs. \nExample: The number of runs scored by Smriti in each of the \n8 matches are given in the table below:\nMatch\nMatch \nMatch \nMatch \nMatch \nMatch \nMatch \nMatch \nMatch \nRuns\n50\n100\n0\n50\n\t\nIn this example, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score \nis 100. Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we \nhave to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would \nbe unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit \nlength = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw \nthe bars according to the scores in each match.

They represent data through equally-spaced bars, each of \nequal width, where the lengths or heights give frequencies of the \ndifferent categories. \n•\t\n\u0007Each category is represented by a bar where the length or height \ndepicts the corresponding frequency (for example, cost) or \nquantity (for example, runs). \n•\t\n\u0007The bars have uniform spaces between them to indicate that they \nare free standing and represent equal categories.\n•\t\n\u0007The bars help in interpreting data much faster than a frequency \ntable.

The markings of the unit lengths \nas per the scale must start from zero.\nTeacher’s Note \nThe main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find \nanswers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to \ntake specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing \npractice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data. \nReprint 2025-26\nData Handling and Presentation\n4.5 Artistic and Aesthetic Considerations\nIn addition to the steps described in previous sections, there are \nalso some other more artistic and aesthetic aspects one can consider \nwhen preparing visual presentations of data to make them more \ninteresting and effective. First, when making a visual presentation \nof data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make \nit fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by \nchoosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also \ndesirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and \neasy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the \ninformation being conveyed.\n\t\nLet us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest \nmountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain \nin meters.\nContinent\nAsia\nSouth \nAmerica\nNorth \nAmerica\nAfrica\nEurope Antarctica\nAustralia\nTallest \nMountain Everest Aconcagua\nDenali\nKiliman-\njaro \nElbrus\nVinson \nMassif\nKoscuiszko\nHeight\n8848m\n6962m\n6194m\n5895m\n5642m\n4892m\n2228m\n\t\nHow much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are \nMount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This \nis not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers.\n\t\nAs we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers \ninto a bar graph, as shown on the right.  Here, each value is drawn \nas a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the \nnumber they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights \nof all these mountains at a glance.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\b\nAsia — Everest \nSouth America — Aconcagua  \nNorth America — Denali\nAfrica — Kilimanjaro \nEurope — Elbrus\nAntarctica — Vinson Massif \nAustralia — Koscuiszko\n1000\n3000 4000\n5000 6000 7000 8000 9000\n\t\nHowever, since the boxes represent heights, it is better and more \nvisually appealing to rotate the picture, so that the boxes grow \nupward, vertically from the ground like mountains. A bar graph \nwith vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the \npillars you find in a building that hold up the roof. \n\t\nBelow is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains. From \nthis column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the \nheights of the mountains. \n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\nAsia  \nEverest \nSouth America  \nAconcagua  \nNorth America  \nDenali\nAfrica  \nKilimanjaro \nEurope  \nElbrus\nAntarctica  \nVinson Massif \nAustralia  \nKoscuiszko\nReprint 2025-26\nData Handling and Presentation\n\t\nIn general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing \nto represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground, \nusing bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly, \nlengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances \nbetween location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar \ngraphs with horizontal arcs. \n Figure it Out\n1.\t\nIf you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the \ntallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph \nwith vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?\n2.\t\n\u0007If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent \nand their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with \nvertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this \ninformation, and then make the corresponding table and bar \ngraph! Which continents have the longest rivers?\nInfographics\nWhen data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified \nwith more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called \ninformation graphics or infographics for short.  The aim of \ninfographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging \nvisuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, \nin a visually pleasing way. \n\t\nAs an example of how infographics can be used to communicate \ndata even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing \nthe tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with \nvertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more \nindicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use \ntriangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a \nsplash of colour as well. Here is the result.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\b\n8000m\n7000m\n6000m\n5000m\n4000m\n3000m\n2000m\n1000m\nEverest\n8848m\n Asia\nAconcagua\n6962m\nS America\nDenali\n6194m \nNorth \nAmerica\nKilimanjaro \n5895m\nAfrica\nElbrus\n5642m\nEurope\nVinson Massif\n4892m \nAntarctica\nKoscuiszko\n2228m\nAustralia\n\t\nWhile this infographic might look more appealing and suggestive at \nfirst glance, it does have some issues. The goal of our bar graph earlier \nwas to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the \nappropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the \nsame widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights. \nHowever, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are \ntaller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional \ninformation that may be misleading and may or may not be correct. \nSometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally \nmislead.\n\t\nTaking this idea further, and to make the picture even more visually \nstimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the \nmountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add \nother details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example, \nwe can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these \nmountains.\n\t\nIs the infographic below better than the column graph with \nrectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more \nrealistic, but is the picture accurate? \n\t\nFor example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus.\nReprint 2025-26\nData Handling and Presentation\nThe seven highest peaks on \nthe seven continents.\n\t\nWhat is 5642 × 2? \n\t\nWhile preparing visually-appealing presentations of data, we \nalso need to be careful that the pictures we draw do not mislead us \nabout the facts. In general, it is important to be careful when making \nor reading infographics, so that we do not mislead our intended \naudiences and we, ourselves, are not misled. \nSu m m a r y\n\u001f\n\u001f\nFacts, numbers, measures, observations and other descriptions of \nthings that convey information about those things is called data.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nData can be organised in a tabular form using tally marks for easy \nanalysis and interpretation. \n\u001f\n\u001f\nFrequencies are the counts of the occurrences of values, measures or \nobservations.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\b\n\u001f\n\u001f\nPictographs represent data in the form of pictures, or objects or parts \nof objects. Each picture represents a frequency which can be 1 or more \nthan 1 — this is called the scale and it must be specified. \n\u001f\n\u001f\nBar graphs have bars of uniform width; the length or height that \nindicates the total frequency of occurrence. The scale that is used to \nconvert length or height to frequency again, must be specified. \n\u001f\n\u001f\nChoosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is \nimportant to accurately and effectively convey the desired information \nor data and to also make it visually appealing.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nOther aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual \nappeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures \nare drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These \naspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling \nand presentation. \n\u001f\n\u001f\nHowever, making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also \nsometimes be misleading.\n\u001f\n\u001f\nBy reading pictographs and bar graphs accurately, we can quickly \nunderstand and make inferences about the data presented.\nReprint 2025-26\nCHAPTER 4 — SOLUTIONS \nData Handling and Presentation  \nSection 4.1  \nPage No. 75 \nFigure it Out  \nQ.1.

There are \nno other rectangular arrangements \npossible.\nIn each of Guna’s arrangements, \nmultiplying the number of rows by \nthe number of columns gives the \nnumber 12. So, the number of rows \nor columns are factors of 12.\nWe saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in \nmore than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7 \ncan be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors — 1 and 7.\nNumbers that have only two factors are called prime numbers or \nprimes. Here are the first few primes — 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Notice \nthat the factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.\nWhat about numbers that have more than two factors?

How many \ncomposite numbers are there from 21 to 30?\nCan we list all the prime numbers from 1 to 100?\nHere is an interesting way to find prime numbers. Just follow the \nsteps given below and see what happens.\nStep 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite.\nStep 2: Circle 2, and then cross \nout all multiples of 2 after that, \ni.e., 4, 6, 8, and so on.\nStep 3: You will find that the \nnext uncrossed number is 3. \nCircle 3 and then cross out all \nthe multiples of 3 after that, \ni.e., 6, 9, 12, and so on.\nStep 4: The next uncrossed \nnumber is 5. Circle 5 and then \ncross out all the multiples of 5 \nafter that, i.e., 10, 15, 20, and \nso on.\nStep 5: Continue this process till all the numbers in the list are either \ncircled or crossed out.\nAll the circled numbers are prime \nnumbers. All the crossed out numbers, \nother than 1, are composite numbers. This \nmethod is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\nThis procedure can be carried on \nfor numbers greater than 100 also. \nEratosthenes was a Greek mathematician \nwho lived around 2200 years ago and \ndeveloped this method of listing primes.\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n42\n44\n46\n48\n50\n52\n54\n56\n58\n60\n62\n64\n66\n68\n70\n72\n74\n76\n78\n80\n82\n84\n86\n88\n90\n92\n94\n96\n98\n99 100\nIt is definitely not some  \nmagic; there should be a  \nreason why it works.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nGuna and Anshu started wondering how this simple method is able \nto find prime numbers!

There is also a \nnew rule — a jump size of 1 is not allowed.\n\t Where should Grumpy place the treasures so that Jumpy cannot \nreach both the treasures?\nWill placing the treasure on 12 and 26 work? No! If the jump size \nis chosen to be 2, then Jumpy will reach both 12 and 26.\nWhat about 4 and 9? Jumpy cannot reach both using any jump size \nother than 1. So, Grumpy knows that the pair 4 and 9 is safe.\nCheck if these pairs are safe:\na. 15 and 39 \t\nb. 4 and 15 \nc. 18 and 29 \t\nd. 20 and 55\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nWhat is special about safe pairs? They don’t have any common \nfactor other than 1. Two numbers are said to be co-prime to each \nother if they have no common factor other than 1.\nExample: As 15 and 39 have 3 as a common factor, they are not \nco-prime.

Let us check.\nAnshu:\t\n\u0007I can write 56 = 14 × 4 and 63 = 21 × 3. So, 14 and 4 \nare factors, of 56. Further, 21 and 3 are factors of \n63. So, there are no common factors. The numbers \nare co-prime.\nGuna:\t\n\u0007Hold on. I can also write 56 = 7 × 8 and 63 = 9 × 7. \nWe see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they \nare not co-prime.\nClearly Guna is right, as 7 is a common factor. \n But where did Anshu go wrong? \nWriting 56 = 14 × 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it \ndoes not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63.\nTry another example: 80 and 63. There are many ways to factorise \nboth numbers.\n80 = 40 × 2 = 20 × 4 = 10 × 8 = 16 × 5 = ???\n63 = 9 × 7 = 3 × 21 = ???\nWe have written ‘???’ to say that there may be more ways to \nfactorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations, \nfor example, 80 = 16 × 5 and 63 = 9 × 7, then there are no common \nfactors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu’s \nmistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other \nways to factorise the numbers.\nWhat this means is that we need a more systematic approach to \ncheck if two numbers are co-prime.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nPrime factorisation\nTake a number such as 56. It is composite, as we saw that it can be \nwritten as 56 = 4 × 14 . So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one \nof these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 × 7. \nTherefore, 56 = 4 × 2 × 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as \n4 = 2 × 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. All the factors appearing here, 2 \nand 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further.\nIn conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers. \nThis is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are \ncalled prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7.\nEvery number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea \nis the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till \nonly primes are left.\nThe number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not \ndivisible by any prime number.\nWhat is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just \n7 (we cannot break it down any further).\nLet us see a few more examples.\nBy going through different ways of breaking down the number, \nwe wrote 63 as 3 × 3 × 7 and as 3 × 7 × 3. Are they different? Not \nreally! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further, \n3 appears two times in \nboth and 7 appears once.\nHere, you see four \ndifferent ways to get \nprime factorisation of 36. \nObserve that in all four \ncases, we get two 2s and \ntwo 3s.\nMultiply back to see \nthat you get 36 in all four cases.\nFor any number, it is a remarkable fact that there is only one prime \nfactorisation, except that the prime factors may come in different \n2×18\n3×12\n4×9\n6×6\n2×2×9\n3×3×4\n2×2×9\n2×3×6\n2×2×3×3\n3×3×2×2\n2×2×3×3\n2×3×2×3\n2×3×2×3\n2×2×3×3\nReprint 2025-26\nPrime Time \norders. As we explain below, the order is not important. However, \nas we saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the \nprime factorisation!\nDoes the order matter? \nUsing this diagram,\ncan you explain why 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, no matter which way you multiply \n2, 3, and 5?\nWhen multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The \nend result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are \nmultiplied in any order, we get 36. In a later class, we shall study \nthis under the names of commutativity and associativity of \nmultiplication. \nThus, the order does not matter. Usually we write the prime \nnumbers in increasing order. For example, 225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 or 30 = \n2 × 3 × 5.\nPrime factorisation of a product of two numbers\nWhen we find the prime factorisation of a number, we first write \nit as a product of two factors. For example, 72 = 12 × 6. Then, we \nfind the prime factorisation of each of the factors. In the above example, \n12 = 2 × 2 × 3 and 6 = 2 × 3. Now, can you say what the prime factorisation \nof 72 is?\nThe prime factorisation of the original number is obtained by \nputting these together.\n72 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nWe can also write this as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3. Multiply and check that \nyou get 72 back!\nObserve how many times each prime factor occurs in the \nfactorisation of 72.\nCompare it with how many times it occurs in the factorisations of \n12 and 6 put together.\n\t Figure it Out\n1.\t Find the prime factorisations of the following numbers: 64, 104, \n105, 243, 320, 141, 1728, 729, 1024, 1331, 1000.\n2.\t The prime factorisation of a number has one 2, two 3s, and one \n11.

Let us discuss two ways in which it can be useful.\nUsing prime factorisation to check if two numbers are co-prime\n\u0007Let us again take the numbers 56 and 63. How can we check if they \nare co-prime? We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers —\n56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7\nNow, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore, \n56 and 63 are not co-prime.\nWhat about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows:\n80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7\nThere are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they \nare co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite. \nWould the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in \nthe prime factorisation of 80 and 63?\nReprint 2025-26\nPrime Time \nTherefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors, \nthen the two numbers are co-prime.\nLet us see some examples.\nExample: \u0007Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as \nfollows:\n40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 231 = 3 × 7 × 11\nWe see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and \n231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime \nfactors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime!\nExample: \u0007Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as \nfollows:\n242 = 2 × 11 × 11 and 195 = 3 × 5 × 13\nThe prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195 \nare 3, 5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242 \nand 195 are co-prime.\nUsing prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible \nby another\nWe can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime \nfactorisation of the second number is included in the prime \nfactorisation of the first number.\nWe say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12, \nthe remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible \nby another without carrying out long division?\nExample: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:\n168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3\nSince we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that,\n 168 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 7 = 12 × 14\nTherefore, 168 is divisible by 12.\nExample: Is 75 divisible by 21? Find the prime factorisations of both:\n75 = 3 × 5 × 5 and 21 = 3 × 7\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nAs we saw in the discussion above, if 75 was a multiple of 21, then \nall prime factors of 21 would also be prime factors of 75. However, 7 \nis a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is \nnot divisible by 21.\nExample: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:\n42 = 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3\nAll prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime \nfactorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42. \nThis is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but \nonly once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not \ndivisible by 12.\nWe can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the \nprime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime \nfactorisation of the first number.\n Figure it Out\t\n1.\t Are the following pairs of numbers co-prime?

Is he right?\n5.5 Divisibility Tests\nSo far, we have been finding factors of numbers in different contexts, \nincluding to determine if a number is prime or not, or if a given pair \nof numbers is co-prime or not.\nReprint 2025-26\nPrime Time \nIt is easy to find factors of small numbers. How do we find factors \nof a large number?\nLet us take 8560.

The \nmultiples of 10, 5 and 2 have a pattern in their last digits which we \nare able to use to check for divisibility. Similarly, can we check if a \nnumber is divisible by 4 by looking at the last digit?\nIt does not work! Look at 12 and 22. They have the same last digit, \nbut 12 is a multiple of 4 while 22 is not. Similarly 14 and 24 have the \nsame last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16 \nand 26 or 18 and 28. What this means is that by looking at the last \ndigit, we cannot tell whether a number is a multiple of 4.\nCan we answer the question by looking at more digits? Make a list \nof multiples of 4 between 1 and 200 and search for a pattern.\n  Find numbers between 330 and 340 that are divisible by 4.

So, 4\n5 is called the simplest form of 16\n20, \nsince 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1.\nAny fraction can be converted to \nlowest terms by dividing both the \nnumerator and denominator by the \nhighest common factor between \nthem. \nReprint 2025-26\nFractions\nExpressing a fraction in lowest terms can also be done in steps. \nSuppose we want to express 36\n60 in lowest terms. First, we notice \nthat both the numerator and denominator are even. So, we divide \nboth by 2, and see that 36\n60 =  18\n30.\nBoth the numerator and denominator are even again, so we can \ndivide them each by 2 again; we get  18\n30 = 9\n15. \nWe now notice that 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, so we divide \nboth by 3 to get  9\n15 = 3\n5 . \nNow, 3 and 5 have no common factor other than 1, so,  36\n60 in lowest \nterms is 3\n5.\nAlternatively, we could have noticed that in 36\n60 , both the numerator \nand denominator are multiples of 12 : we see that 36 = 3 × 12 and \n60 = 5 × 12. Therefore, we could have concluded that  36\n60 = 3\n5 straight away.\nEither method works and will give the same answer!

We will describe the history of the development \nof fractions in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we simply \nsummarise the steps in Brahmagupta’s method for addition of \nfractions.\nBrahmagupta’s method for adding fractions \n1.\t Find equivalent fractions so that the fractional unit is common \nfor all fractions. This can be done by finding a common multiple \nof the denominators (e.g., the product of the denominators, or the \nsmallest common multiple of the denominators). \n2.\t Add these equivalent fractions with the same fractional units. \nThis can be done by adding the numerators and keeping the same \ndenominator. \n3.\t Express the result in lowest terms if needed.\nLet us carry out another example of Brahmagupta’s method. \nExample: Find the sum of 2\n3 and 1\n5.\nThe denominators of the given fractions are 3 and 5. The lowest \ncommon multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Then we see that\n3 = 2 × 5\n3 × 5  = 10\n15 , 1\n5 = 1 × 3\n5 × 3  = 3\n15 .\nReprint 2025-26\nFractions\nTherefore,  2\n3  + 1\n5  = 10\n15  + 3\n15  = 13\n15 .\nExample: Find the sum of 1\n6  and 1\n3.\nThe smallest common multiple of 6 and 3 is 6. \n6  will remain 1\n6 .\n3  = 1 × 2\n3 × 2  = 2\n6 \nTherefore, 1\n6  + 1\n3  = 1\n6  + 2\n6  = 3\n6.\nThe fraction \n6  can now be re-expressed in lowest terms, if \ndesired. This can be done by dividing both the numerator and \ndenominator by 3 (the biggest common factor of 3 and 6):\n6  = 3 ÷ 3\n6 ÷ 3  = 1\n2.\nTherefore, 1\n6  + 1\n3  = 1\n2.\n Figure it Out\n1.\t Add the following fractions using Brahmagupta’s method:\na.  2\n7 + 5\n7 + 6\n7 \t\nb.  3\n4 + 1\n3 \t\nc.  2\n3 + 5\n6\t\nd.  2\n3 + 2\n7 \t\ne.  3\n4 + 1\n3 + 1\n5 \nf.  2\n3 + 4\n5\t\n\t\ng.  4\n5 + 2\n3 \t\nh.  3\n5 + 5\n8 \t\n i.  9\n2 + 5\n4 \t\n j.  8\n3 + 2\n7  \nk.  3\n4 + 1\n3 + 1\n5 \t\nl.  2\n3 + 4\n5 + 3\n7 \t m.  9\n2 + 5\n4 + 7\n2.\t Rahim mixes 2\n3 litres of yellow paint with 3\n4 litres of blue paint to \nmake green paint.

It was \ncalled bhinna in Sanskrit, which means ‘broken’. It was also called \nbhaga or ansha meaning ‘part’ or ‘piece’. \nThe way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In \nancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript \n(from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 1\n2, they \nwrote it as 1\n2 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it \ntoday! This method of writing and working with fractions continued \nto be used in India for the next several centuries, including by \nAryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya \n(c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others. The line \nsegment between the numerator and denominator in ‘1\n2’ and in other \nReprint 2025-26\nFractions\nfractions was later introduced by the Moroccan mathematician \nAl-Hassar (in the 12th century). Over the next few centuries the \nnotation then spread to Europe and around the world.\nFractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient \nEgyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only \nfractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More \ngeneral fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now \ncalled ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional \nunits, e.g., 19\n24  = 1\n2 + 1\n6 + 1\n8, can be quite an art and leads to beautiful \npuzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below. \nGeneral fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1) \nwere first introduced in India, along with their rules of arithmetic \noperations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even \ndivision of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulba-\nsutras’ shows that even during  Vedic times, Indians had discovered \nthe rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures \nfor working with and computing with fractions were first codified \nformally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta. \nBrahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with \nfractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta \ndescribed how to add and subtract fractions as follows:\n“By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator \nof each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions \nare reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition, \nthe numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added. \nIn case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta, \nBrahmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE)\nThe Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were \ntransmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and \nthey came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century \nand then spread worldwide.\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\n  Puzzle!\n\t\n\u0007It is easy to add up fractional units to obtain the sum 1, if one \nuses the same fractional unit, for example, \n\t\n2 + 1\n2 = 1,  1\n3 + 1\n3 + 1\n3 = 1,  1\n4 + 1\n4 + 1\n4 + 1\n4 = 1, etc. \n\t\n\u0007\t However, can you think of a way to add fractional units that \nare all different to get 1?\n\t\n\u0007\t It is not possible to add two different fractional units to get 1. \nThe reason is that 1\n2 is the largest fractional unit, and 1\n2 + 1\n2 = 1. \n\t\n\u0007\t To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at \nleast one of the 1\n2’s with some smaller fractional unit - but then \nthe sum would be less than 1! Therefore, it is not possible for \ntwo different fractional units to add up to 1. \n\t\n\u0007\t We can try to look instead for a way to write 1 as the sum of \nthree different fractional units. \n \n1.  \u0007Can you find three different fractional units that add \nup to 1? \n\t\n   \u0007It turns out there is only one solution to this problem \n(up to changing the order of the 3 fractions)! Can you \nfind it? Try to find it before reading further. \nHere is a systematic way to find the solution. We know that  \n3 + 1\n3 + 1\n3 = 1. To get the  fractional units to be different, we will have \nto increase at least one of the 1\n3’s, and decrease at least one of the \nother 1\n3’s to compensate for that increase.  The only way to increase \n3 to another fractional unit is to replace it by 1\n2. So 1\n2 must be one of \nthe fractional units.\nNow 1\n2 + 1\n4 + 1\n4 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we \nwill have to increase one of the 1\n4’s and decrease the other 1\n4 to \ncompensate for that increase. Now the only way to increase 1\n4 to \nTry\nThis\nReprint 2025-26\nFractions\nanother fractional unit, that is different from 1\n2, is to replace it by 1\n3. \nSo two of the fractions must be 1\n2 and 1\n3!

On the other hand, if you rotate \nit by 90° about the red point at the centre, the \nwindmill looks exactly the same.\nWe say that the windmill has rotational \nsymmetry.\nWhen talking of rotational symmetry, there is always a fixed \npoint about which the object is rotated. This fixed point is called the \ncentre of rotation.\nWill the windmill above look exactly the same when rotated \nthrough an angle of less than 90°?\nNo!\nAn angle through which a figure can be rotated to look exactly the \nsame is called an angle of rotational symmetry, or just an angle of \nsymmetry, for short.\nReprint 2025-26\nSymmetry\nFor the windmill, the angles of symmetry are 90° (quarter turn), \n180° (half turn), 270° (three-quarter turn) and 360° (full turn). \nObserve that when any figure is rotated by 360°, it comes back to its \noriginal position, so 360° is always an angle of symmetry.\nThus, we see that the windmill has 4 angles of symmetry.\nDo you know of any other shape that has exactly four angles of \nsymmetry?\nHow many angles of symmetry does a square have? How much \nrotation does it require to get the initial square?\nWe get back a square overlapping with itself after 90° of rotation. \nThis takes point A to the position of point B, point B to the position \nof point C, point C to the position of point D, and point D back to the \nposition of point A.

Does this overlap \nwith the original figure.\nNo. Why?\nAnother rotation through 180° from this position gives the original \nshape.\nThis figure comes back to its original shape only after one \ncomplete rotation through 360°. So, we say that this figure does not \nhave rotational symmetry.\nRotational Symmetry of Figures with \nRadial Arms\nConsider this figure, a picture with \n4 radial arms. How many angles of \nsymmetry does it have? What are they? \nNote that the angle between adjacent \ncentral dotted lines is 90°.\nCan you change the angles between \nthe radial arms so that the figure still has \n4 angles of symmetry? Try drawing it.\nTo check if the figure drawn indeed has 4 angles of symmetry, \nyou could draw the figure on two different pieces of paper. Cut out \nthe radial arms from one of the papers. Keep the figure on the paper \nfixed and rotate the cutout to check for rotational symmetry.\nHow will you modify the figure above so that it has only two \nangles of symmetry?\n90O\nReprint 2025-26\nSymmetry\nHere is one way:\nWe have seen figures having 4 and 2 angles of symmetry. Can we \nget a figure having exactly 3 angles of symmetry? Can you use radial \narms for this?\nLet us try with 3 radial arms as in the figure below. How many \nangles of symmetry does it have and what are they?\nHere is a figure with three radial arms.\nTrace and cut out a copy of this figure. By rotating the cutout over \nthis figure determine its angles of rotation.\nWe see that only a full turn or a rotation of 360° will bring the figure \nback into itself. So this figure does not have rotational symmetry as \n360 degrees is its only angle of symmetry.\nHowever, can anything in the figure be changed to make it have \n3 angles of symmetry?\nReprint 2025-26\nGanita Prakash | Grade 6\nCan it be done by changing the angles between the dotted lines?\nIf a figure with three radial arms should have rotational symmetry, \nthen a rotated version of it should overlap with the original. Here \nare rough diagrams of both of them.\nIf these two figures must overlap, what can you tell about the \nangles?\nC\nB\nA\nB\nA\nC\nObserve that ∠A must overlap ∠B, ∠B must overlap ∠C and ∠C \nmust overlap ∠A.\nSo, ∠A = ∠B = ∠C. What must this angle be?\nWe know that a full turn has 360 degrees. This is equally distributed \namongst these three angles. So each angle must be 360°\n3  = 120°.\nSo, the radial arms figure with 3 arms shows rotational symmetry \nwhen the angle between the adjacent dotted lines is 120°. Use paper \ncutouts to verify this observation.\nNow how many angles of rotation does the figure have and what \nare they?\nInitial \nposition\nAfter 120° \nrotation\nAfter 240° \n(120° + 120°) \nrotation\nAfter 360° \n(120° + 120°+ 120°) \nrotation\nNote: The colours have been added to show the rotations.\nReprint 2025-26\nSymmetry\nLet us explore more figures.\n\t Can you draw a figure with radial arms that has a) exactly 5 \nangles of symmetry, b) 6 angles of symmetry? Also find the angles of \nsymmetry in each case.\nHint: \u0007Use 5 radial arms for the first case. What should the angle \nbetween two adjacent radial arms be?\n\t Consider a figure with radial arms having exactly 7 angles \nof symmetry. What will be its smallest angle of symmetry? Is the \nnumber of degrees a whole number in this case?

It turns out \nthat this is the case for most figures, except for the most symmetric \nshapes like the circle, whose symmetries we now discuss.\nSymmetries of a circle\nThe circle is a fascinating figure. What happens when you rotate a \ncircle clockwise about its centre? It coincides with itself. It does not \nmatter what angle you rotate it by! So, for a circle, every angle is an \nangle of symmetry.\nNow take a point on the rim of the circle and join it to the centre. \nExtend the segment to a diameter of the circle.

How do these \nplants and animals grow?\nWhat will we \nexplore with \nthe help of this \nbook?\n?\nOf course, to grow, we need food to eat, and especially in \na large and diverse country like India, food is so fascinating. \nAcross the country, we have different cuisines with their many \ntasty dishes. What are they made of? How do we find out? \nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nThen again, there are so many different things around \nus—the paper we write on, the metal key, the plastic ruler \nand the rubber eraser in our box, the magnet that keeps the \nbox closed, the clothes we wear, the cup we drink milk in \nand so many other things. What are they made of? Are they \nmade of different materials? How do we separate different \nmaterials from one another?\nAlong with food, we need water to survive. Water is such a \ndelightful substance. Have you ever jumped in a puddle when \nit rained? Do you ever wonder why and how it rains?\nHave you noticed that water freezes and becomes ice \nwhen we cool it and boils and becomes steam when we \nheat it? Do you enjoy drinking cool water in the summer \nor showering with warm water in the winter? How do we \nunderstand hot and cold? Whether it is water, or our own \nbody when we have fever, finding out how hot something is \ncan be important!\nReprint 2025-26\nThe Wonderful World of Science\nWe will have an almost unending list of questions about \neverything on Earth as we further explore this book. But \nwhy limit our questions to the Earth alone? We can ask \nquestions on things beyond—the Sun, the Moon, and the \nmillions of stars that shine in the sky!\nWhether you are learning about the \nstructure of a leaf, discovering how things \nmove, or separating the skin of a peanut seed, \nwe hope each chapter of this book will ignite \nyour spirit of inquiry. And hopefully you will \nhave lots of questions on your mind!\nEven though you may have not realised, \nyou have already been fi nding answers to \nmany of your questions. Suppose your pen stops \nwriting. What would you do? You would ask yourself the \nquestion, “Why did my pen stop writing?” You might guess \nthat the ink fi nished. \nYou would then test this guess by opening the \npen and checking the ink refi ll. If it is empty, \nyou would know that your guess was \ncorrect. But suppose you found that the \nink was not fi nished. Now what would \nyou do? You would make another \nguess—perhaps the ink might have \ndried up. To test if this guess is correct \nor not, you will try something else. \nThis is exactly how Science \nworks! The way you tried to fi nd \nout why your pen stopped writing \nis an example of the scientiﬁ c \nmethod. \nActivity 1.1: Let us think and write\n \n\nWrite about a similar problem that you tried to solve. \n \n\nWhat steps did you take?\nScience is not just about memorising facts and fi gures or \ndoing experiments. It is about following a step-by-step \nprocess that helps us fi nd answers to our questions. So what \nare the steps that we can follow?\nHow can we try \nto ﬁ nd answers \nto our questions \non our own? ?\nempty, \nwas\nhe \nld \ner \nve \nct \nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nFirst, we observe something that we fi nd interesting \nor we do not understand.\nThis makes us wonder and perhaps think of a question \nabout it.\nThen, we guess a possible answer to that question.\nWe test this guess through experiments or more \nobservations.\nWe then try to analyse the results to see if it actually answers \nour question.\nScientists are people who \nfollow the scientifi c method to \nsolve problems or to discover \nnew things. But anyone who \nfollows the scientifi c method is \nworking like a scientist. Someone \ncooking food may be wondering \nwhy the dal has spilled out of \nthe cooker—was there too much \nwater?\nThink of a bicycle repair \nperson trying to fi nd out why a \ntyre is fl at—from where did the \nair leak out? Or an electrician \ntrying to fi nd why a light bulb \nis not working—is there some \nproblem with the bulb or the \nswitch? When we try to ask \nquestions and fi nd out answers, \nwe are all, in a way, scientists!\nActivity 1.2: Let us think and write\n \n\nDescribe a daily life situation where you think someone \nwas following a scientifi c method.\nDo you now realise that there are several daily-life situations \nwhere we knowingly or unknowingly apply the scientifi c \nReprint 2025-26\nThe Wonderful World of Science\nmethod? Though we all apply the scientific method to \nsome extent, learning science will develop our capabilities \nfor finding solutions to bigger problems and solving \nmore mysteries of the universe. And to be able to learn \nscience well, the first and foremost thing is to be curious \nand observe your surroundings keenly. And when we are \ncurious, we start posing questions, asking how and why? \nJust remember, the world is full of things we do not know, \nthings that are waiting to be explored.\nActivity 1.3: Let us think and write\n\n\nIf you have to ask “Why?” about something, what would \nyou ask about?\n\n\nTry to write down how you would attempt to find an \nanswer to your question.\nScience is rarely done alone.

You are a wonderful \nexample of a living being. Whenever you attempt to group \nthings around you as living or non-living, you can compare \nthem with yourself. Which characteristics help you in \ndifferentiating yourself from a car? For instance, a car \ndoes not grow. Does it mean it is non-living? Now, which \ncharacteristics have you used to classify a car as non-living? \nContinue your discussion in a similar way to identify the \nessential characteristics of living beings.\nWhat are some common characteristics that make living \nbeings very different from the non-living things? Let us \nlearn about them.\nCan we consider movement as one of the characteristics to \ndifferentiate between the living and the non-living? List five \nthings around you that can move on their own. Do you think \nthat all five things that you have listed can be considered as \nliving just because they can move on their \nown? However, unlike animals, plants do \nnot move from one place to another. Do \nyou consider them as living? \nEven though plants do not move from \none place to another, they do show certain \ntypes of movements. Opening of flowers is \none of the examples of movement in plants. \nAnother example of movement in plants is \nseen in insectivorous plants. Insectivorous \nplants are dependent on insects for their nutrition. Drosera \nis one of the examples of an insectivorous plant. Drosera is \nfeatured with saucer-shaped leaves having many hair-like \nprojections of unequal length with sticky ends. Whenever \nan insect enters the saucer, hairs move inward and \ntrap the insect with their sticky ends. Try to observe \nthe mechanism of movement in other insectivorous \nplants. Climbers also wind themselves around \nany object placed close to them. That means, \neven though plants do not move from \none place to another, they do show \nsome movements.\nCompare \nyourself \nwith \nthe \npicture of your childhood. Can you \nGrowth of a child\nDrosera\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nwear the dress that you used to wear four years ago? No, \nbecause you have become larger in size. This is due to growth \nin your body. Plants and other living beings also grow. Can \nwe consider growth as a characteristic of living beings? \nLiving beings need food (nutrition) for their growth \nand development. List five living beings that require food \nto grow.\nNow, think of a process without which we cannot live. \nCount the number of breaths you take per minute after \na normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. \nRecord the data and observe. Do you notice any difference \nin the number of breaths after each situation? Do you notice \nthe process of breathing in other animals like dogs, cats, \ncows and buffaloes? Notice the movement of their abdomen \nwhile they are taking rest. \nIn the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air \nmoves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe \nout, the air moves from inside our body to outside. \nBreathing is part of a process called respiration. Do \nplants also respire? There are tiny pores called stomata \non the surface of leaves. These pores help plants in taking \nair in and out. Interact with senior class students in your \nschool and request if they can demonstrate stomata using \na microscope in your class. All living beings respire.\nHave you noticed white patches forming on shirts around \nthe armpits during summers? These \npatches are formed due to sweat. The \nsweat consists of water and salts removed \nby the body as waste products. Removal \nof waste products from the body is called \nexcretion. Urine is also formed as a \nproduct of excretion in animals. Do you \nknow that plants also excrete? You may \nnotice plants excrete excess water and \nminerals in the form of small droplets on \nleaves. For example, grasses and roses.  All \nliving beings excrete.\nLet us look at another characteristic. \nWhat is your reaction if you unexpectedly \nstep on a sharp object, such as a thorn, \nWater droplets on grass\nReprint 2025-26\nLiving Creatures: Exploring their \nCharacteristics\nwhile walking without shoes, or you accidentally touch a hot \ncup of tea? Stepping on a thorn and touching a hot object are \nstimuli. Any thing or any event that prompts living beings \nto respond is called a stimulus. List three stimuli (plural \nof stimulus) and your body’s \ninstant response to them. \nDo plants also respond to \nstimuli? Yes, plants also respond \nto stimuli. For example, touch-\nme-not \n(mimosa, \nchhui-mui, \nlajjalu) plants fold their leaves \nwhen we touch them. Have you \nalso observed that certain plants \nfold their leaves after sunset? \nSpecifically, the leaves of certain \nplants facing each other tend \nto come together. This can be \nobserved in the sleeping leaves \nof amla (Indian gooseberry) \ntree. All living beings respond to stimuli. Find a few more \nplants in your neighbourhood which fold their leaves after \nsunset. \nWhy do the leaves of chhui-mui and amla plants respond \nin this way? Which stimulus could be responsible for their \nbehaviour?\nHave you seen young ones of cats, dogs or other animals? \nList young ones of five different animals. Have you seen \nyoung ones of any non-living things such as a pencil, a chair \nor an electric bulb?\nAll living beings reproduce. Reproduction is the \nprocess of producing new ones of one’s own kind. Why is \nreproduction necessary? It is necessary for the continuity \nof life. \nWhen a living being is not able to exhibit all of the above \nmentioned characteristics, despite the availability of all \nresources (like food, air and water) needed for being alive, \nit is said to be dead. \nFrom the above discussion, we can understand that \nall living beings share some common characteristics. For \nexample, all living beings show movement, they need \nTouch-me-not (chhui-mui) plant\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nfood, and they grow. They also respire, reproduce, excrete, \nrespond to stimuli, and eventually, die. Absence of any of \nthese features indicates that they are non-living things. \nNow that you know how to identify a living being, fill \nup the remaining two columns (IV and V) of Table 10.1 and \ncomplete the activity.\nIn which category would you place a seed—living or non-\nliving? Why? \nLet us explore how a seed germinates to observe some \nof these essential characteristics in plants.\n10.2\tEssential Conditions for Germination  \nof a Seed \nHave you observed a seed germinating? You might have \nwondered what conditions are required for germination \nof a seed. What conditions do you think are required for \nseed germination? How will you investigate whether these \nconditions have an effect on the germination of a seed?\nLet us find out by performing Activity 10.2.\nActivity 10.2: Let us experiment\n\n\nTake four identical pots filled with garden soil. Sow \nfour bean seeds in each pot. Now, keep these pots in the \nfollowing conditions for 15 days. \n\n Pot A: Do not water the soil.

Record your \nobservations in Table 10.2.\n\n\nCompare your predictions with your observations.\nDo you think sunlight is necessary for germination of \nseeds? Do the seeds in all the pots receive air, water and \nsunlight? Is there any pot in which air is not available to the \nseeds? If so, why is it not available? What happens to the \nseeds in the pot where water is provided in excess? Which \nseeds receive both air and water? Identify the pots where \nyou can notice the germination of seeds. \nDo your observations match with your predictions? \nWrite possible reasons in favour of your observations in \nTable 10.2. Based on your observations, state the conditions \nwhich favour seed germination.\nWhich of the following are essential for seed germination–\nair, water and sunlight? Compare the available conditions \nin each pot. Germination of bean seeds requires the right \namount of water and air. Why do seeds require these \nconditions for germination? Do you think that the absence \nof one or more of these conditions will affect \nseed germination?\nLet us understand how these conditions help \nin seed germination. The effects of the following \nconditions have been seen in Activity 10.2.\nWater: Seeds require water for germination. \nWater enables the seeds to carry out the \nprocesses necessary for their growth. The outer \ncovering of the seed is called seed coat. Water \nsoftens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo \ninside it to develop into a plant.\nAir and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the \nair available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, \nspaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily.\nLight and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for \nthe bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their \ngermination. In general, most seeds do not require light for \ngermination. But after germination, sunlight is required for \nfurther growth of the seedling.\nGerminated bean seed\nSeed Coat\nEmbryo\nReprint 2025-26\nIn the Chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, \nyou have learnt that human beings need a balanced diet \nfor good health and proper growth. Similarly, plants too \nneed favourable conditions and nutrients \nfor their proper growth and development. \nWhat other conditions do you think would \naffect seed germination?\nIn \nActivity \n10.1, \nwhat \nare \nthe \ncharacteristics of living beings which \nmade you place plants in living beings? Do \nplants show growth in Activity 10.2? Are \nthere any other characteristics of living \nbeings that these plants show?\nLet us study another characteristic that can be seen \nclearly in plants—growth and movement.\n10.3\tGrowth and Movement in Plants \nHow do plants respond to sunlight? Does sunlight affect the \ndirection of growth of different parts of plants? In which \ndirection would the root and shoot of a plant grow and \nmove if the plant is placed inverted? How would you design \nan activity to find answers to these questions? \nActivity 10.3: Let us design\n\n\nTake some bean or gram seeds and allow them to \ngerminate on a moist cloth or a moist tissue paper.\n\n\nLet them germinate until each of them develop into a \nseedling having a small root and a small shoot.\n\n\nNow, take three glass beakers or tumblers, and label \nthem as A, B and C.\nDo you \nknow?\nSome seeds of flowering plants, like Coleus and \nPetunia, require light to germinate. Covering \nthese seeds with soil inhibits their sprouting. \nSeeds of flowering plants, like Calendula and \nZinnia, need darkness to germinate. These seeds \nshould be covered with sufficient soil.\nHow would you \nnow categorise a \nseed, as living or \nnon-living?\n?\nLiving Creatures: Exploring their \nCharacteristics\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n\n\nPour water into all the three beakers to ensure that the \nseedling in each beaker remains above the water level.\n\n\nIn each case, let the bottom of the blotting paper get \ncompletely wet by soaking in the water.

Also, the shoot bends and grows upwards.\n3.\t When the plant gets sunlight only from one direction, \nthe shoot grows in the direction of light while the root \ncontinues to grow downwards.\nAfter conducting Activity 10.3, we can conclude that shoots \nof plants grow upward and exhibit movement towards \nsunlight but roots of plants grow downwards.\nJagadish Chandra Bose (1858–1937) was an Indian \nscientist who did some fascinating experiments \nwith plants. He built a machine called a crescograph \nto record how plants respond to stimuli like light, \nheat, electricity and gravity. With this machine, he \ncould measure how fast plants grow.

What changes do you \nobserve after the fruits are formed? Does the plant become \nyellow and dry even when you continue watering it? Sow \nthe seeds obtained from your bean plant. Watch how the \nseeds give rise to a new generation of bean plants. Compare \nthe sketches that you have drawn in Table 10.4 with Fig. 10.4. \nA seed grows into a young plant and matures to produce \nflowers and fruit. The fruit, in this case a pod, contains \nseeds which give rise to a new generation of bean plants. \nThe entire process from a seed to a plant, and then, to the \nnext generation of seeds is called the life cycle of a plant \n(Fig. 10.4). When a plant stops growing and all activities of \nlife gradually come to an end, even after the availability of \nall the necessary conditions, the plant is considered dead.\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n10.5\tLife Cycle of Animals\nWe have learnt about the life cycle of a plant.

Female mosquitoes are bloodsucking insects that transmit \nseveral diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya. You \nmight have learnt from newspapers, school noticeboards \nor awareness campaigns that mosquito breeding should be \nprevented.

The adult \nmosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days. \nWe have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg \n(stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage II), the larva \ngrows into pupa (stage III), and the pupa transforms into an \nadult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays \neggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues.\nSignificant changes occur in the appearance, body shape \nand structure during the various stages in the life cycle of \na mosquito. The shape of the egg is quite different from the \nlarva; the larva appears very different from the pupa. The \npupa appears very distinct from the adult mosquito. Is it \neasy to imagine that a mosquito emerges from a pupa?\nThe silk moth also passes through four life stages—egg, larva, \npupa and adult. Eggs hatch into larvae, which then grow in \nsize. Larvae secrete thread-like material which they \nwrap around themselves, before changing to pupae. \nThese are the fibres that are used to make silk fabric. \nIn India, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission \n(KVIC) has set up several centres for silk production.\n Do you \nknow?\n10.5.2 Life cycle of a frog\nActivity 10.6: Let us analyse\nAvadhi and Aayush are dressed up in full sleeves shirts and \nfull pants today.

You may also go to a small \nwater body during the rainy season with a facilitator and \nexplore it by taking due safety precautions. \nYou may notice a white jelly-like substance on the surface \nof water towards the edge of the pond (Fig. 10.7). This may \nalso be attached to plants growing in or around the water. \nThis jelly-like substance is actually a cluster of eggs of a frog \nand is known as spawn.\nObserve the features of all the stages of a frog shown in \nFig. 10.7. How will you decide the sequence of the given stages \n(A, B, C, D, E, F)? Some of the stages show distinct changes in \ntheir initial and final shapes.

You will see that tadpoles develop legs \nbut still have tails. Tails help them swim in water. Tadpoles \ngrow gradually and start looking like little frogs called \nfroglets. They still live in water but begin to spend some \ntime on land. They continue to grow and lose their tails \ncompletely. Their legs become strong to help them jump \nand land. They become fully developed adult frogs who live \nboth in water and on land.\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nPlants and animals are a part of the living world.

This \nvacation, they visit their Ajji (grandmother). Ajji lives in a \nvillage on the edge of a forest in the Western Ghats. The air \nin the village is fresh and cooler than in the city. They can \nsee beautiful hills, streams, and many interesting plants, \nanimals and birds around them. \nOne afternoon, Bhoomi and Surya ask Ajji to tell them \nmore about the place. Ajji says, “Children, do you know that \nthis place has several treasures of nature that enrich our \nlives?  The pure air is refreshing and the soil is so fertile \nthat it supports a variety of living beings. Moreover, this \nplace gets plenty of sunlight which is useful in many ways. \nDifferent varieties of trees provide food and shelter to \nanimals including various birds and insects. Can you think \nof more such treasures of nature?” \nA village\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nBhoomi replies, “Ajji, we use water for drinking and \ngrowing vegetables.” Ajji says, “Yes. We need these treasures \nfor our survival and for making our lives more comfortable. \nWithout these treasures of nature, any form of life on Earth \nis not possible.” We all are a part of nature.\nAjji explains the importance of air around us and how it \nis essential for our survival. Let us find out more about air.\n11.1\tAir\nOne morning, Bhoomi and Surya see \nAjji performing some breathing \nexercises. Ajji asks them to join her. \nShe says, “I am taking deep breaths \nin, and letting them out. This helps \nin getting more fresh air in the \nlungs to stay healthy.” Bhoomi and \nSurya sit with Ajji and start taking \ndeep breaths. \nLet us also perform a breathing \nexercise. \nActivity 11.1: Let us experience\n\n\nTake a deep breath in, and then breathe out slowly.\n\n\nTake a deeper breath in again.\n\n\nHold your breath for as long as you can and then \nbreathe out slowly.\n\n\nHow long can you hold your breath?\n\n\nHow do you feel when you hold your breath?\nFrom this activity, we find that it is difficult to \nhold our breath for a long time. The air which \nwe breathe in has oxygen. Our body needs \noxygen to perform its functions. When we hold \nour breath for a long time, the body does not get \nenough oxygen to perform its functions. Thus, \nwe need oxygen for our survival. Similarly, \nmost of the living beings also need oxygen for \ntheir survival.  \nBreathing exercise\nCaution  \nDo not hold your \nbreath for so long \nthat you start feeling \nuncomfortable.\nReprint 2025-26\nNature’s Treasures\nWe can survive without food or water for a few \ndays, but we cannot survive without oxygen for \neven a few minutes.\nDo you \nknow?\nFig. 11.1: Composition of air\nYou notice the presence of air when the leaves of a tree \nrustle, the clothes hanging on a clothes line sway, or the pages \nof an open book begin to flutter once a fan is switched on.\nMoving air is called wind. Sometimes it blows fast, for \nexample, during a storm, and sometimes it blows gently as a \nbreeze. You must have played with a firki (paper pinwheel) \nmany times. Let us make a firki by performing Activity 11.2.\nThe air which surrounds the Earth is a mixture of gases. \nCan you name some gases which are present in the air? Air \ncontains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and other \ngases in small quantities. Fig. 11.1 gives the composition of air \nin percentage. Notice that in Fig. 11.1 there are 100 squares. \nOut of 100 squares, 78 are occupied by nitrogen, \n21 are occupied by oxygen, and 1 by argon, carbon \ndioxide and other gases. \nPercentage is the number of parts in 100.

It is the wind that makes a firki rotate. \nThe working of a windmill is similar to that \nof a firki. Wind rotates the wings of a windmill. \nWindmills can be used to run flour mills, to pull \nup water from a well, or to generate electricity. \nIn India, there are many windmill farms. \nA windmill farm is an area that has a large \nnumber of windmills which use the energy of \nthe wind to generate electricity (Fig. 11.3).\nFig 11.3: A windmill farm \nMuppandal Wind Farm in Tamil Nadu, Jaisalmer \nWind Park in Rajasthan and Brahmanvel Wind \nFarm in Maharashtra are some of the leading \nwindmill farms in our country.

Water too \nis essential and precious for us. How do you feel when you \ncannot get water to drink, especially when you are thirsty? \nLet us find out more about water.\n11.2\tWater \nBhoomi and Surya help Ajji in \nfilling the troughs of water for \nthe cows. They also help her in \nwatering plants such as vegetables \nand medicinal herbs in the garden. \nAjji teaches them how to water the \nplants so that every drop is used \nand none of it goes waste. \nCan you think of some more \nuses of water in your daily life? \nWrite down your responses in the \nblank bubble. \nWe need water for many daily activities, such as drinking, \ncooking, bathing, washing and cleaning. It is also used for \ngrowing crops and for industrial purposes. Where do we get \nwater from? Make a list of the different sources of water.\nWater covers about two-thirds of the Earth’s surface. \nMost of the water is found in oceans and seas. However, \nthis water is saline or salty. This saline water is not fit for \ndomestic, agricultural and industrial use. For all these \nactivities, we need freshwater, which is present in the form \nof ice sheets or snow, rivers or lakes on the surface of the \nEarth, and underground. Freshwater present in ice sheets \n..................................\n..................................\nWe need \nwater for \ndrinking.\nWatering the plants\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nand snow, or underground water is difficult to access. A very \nsmall fraction of the freshwater present in ponds, rivers, \nlakes and wells is easily accessible. Water is precious, that is \nwhy Ajji guides them to use it with care.\nDo you feel that water is being used efficiently in our \ndaily activities? Have you observed water being wasted in \nyour daily activities? Let us find out activities where water \nis wasted and how this wastage can be reduced.\nActivity 11.3: Let us find out\nFill the Column II and Column III in Table 11.1.\nTable 11.1: Wastage of water in your daily activities\nColumn I\nColumn II\nColumn III\nActivity\nHow is water \nwasted?\nSuggest ways to reduce \nwastage of water.\n1.\t Hand washing\n2.\t Washing clothes\n3.\t Washing utensils\n4.\t Taking shower\n5.\t Cooking\n6.\t Gardening\n7.\t Brushing teeth\nWhat conclusion can you draw from the information \nyou gathered in the table? What can you and your family \ndo to reduce this wastage of water? There are many ways \nto reduce wastage of water. For example, turning off taps \nwhen not in use and fixing water leakages. Recycling water \nand water harvesting also help in saving water.\nOur country is blessed with numerous rivers, streams \nand lakes. Have you ever noticed plastic bags and wrappers \nfloating on the surface of water? We pollute freshwater \nReprint 2025-26\nNature’s Treasures\nsources by throwing trash (waste materials) in them. Waste \nfrom homes and industries pollute our water sources when \nit is dumped into them. Identify other human activities that \nlead to water pollution. Discuss with your friends in the class \nwhat you can do to reduce water pollution. Polluted water is \nnot fit for consumption by living beings.\nAs freshwater sources are limited, there is a shortage of \nwater in many parts of India. At some places, people have to \nwalk long distances to fetch drinking water. Everyone does \nnot have the same kind of access to water. It is important \nfor us to conserve water and use it judiciously. We must \nalso prevent it from being polluted so that water remains fit \nfor consumption by all living beings. In what ways can you \nconserve water? \nWater harvesting is one of the \nmethods for conserving water. In many \nbuildings, \nrainwater \nis \ncollected \nand stored in large quantities for \nlater use. This is called rainwater \nharvesting (Fig. 11.4a). Do you know \nthat rainwater is also harvested in \nmany homes, residential societies or \nschools? It is an age-old practice in \nIndia. \nFor example, stepwells (Fig. 11.4b), \ncommonly known as Bawadi in \nRajasthan and Vav in Gujarat are \nbuilt for water harvesting as a \nresponse to the scarcity of water in \nthese regions. These stepwells have \na unique system of water harvesting. \nThey store not only rainwater but \nalso water seeping from nearby \nlakes, ponds and rivers. The walls of \nthe trenches (long deep holes dug in \nthe ground) are lined with blocks of \nstones that allow seepage of water. \nFind traditional water harvesting \npractices in your locality. Discuss \nwith your teachers and parents to \nlearn more about it. \nFig. 11.4 (b): Bawadi (Toorji ka Jhalra, \nJodhpur in Rajasthan) \nFig. 11.4 (a): Rainwater harvesting\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nIn the chapter ‘A Journey through States of Water’, we \nhave learnt about the water cycle, where the Sun plays an \nimportant role in the evaporation of water. Have you ever \nobserved your mother or grandmother cut raw mangoes \nand expose them to the hot sun for several days to dry? Let \nus explore more about energy from the Sun.\n11.3\tEnergy from the Sun\nOn a sunny day, Bhoomi and Surya are helping Ajji dry \nchillies in the Sun. Ajji says, “We use the heat from the Sun \nto dry it. We can use dried chillies when fresh ones are not \navailable. I will give you some to take home. Do you know \nthat the Sun is the main source of energy on Earth? All plants \nand animals are dependent on it.”\nWe use heat and light from the Sun for various purposes. \nWhat are some of the activities for which we need heat and \nlight? Bhoomi draws some pictures to show the uses of heat \nand light from the Sun. Help her by adding more examples. \nDraw the pictures and write their descriptions in the \nspace provided.\nPlants make food\nDrying of clothes \nOne afternoon, Bhoomi and Surya pass by the field near \nAjji’s house, where they see a cow grazing the grass. They \ntalk about the Sun being the main source of energy. Read \nthe conversation carefully and answer.\t\nWorld Water Day is observed on 22nd March every year. \nFind out its importance. \nDo you \nknow?\nReprint 2025-26\nNature’s Treasures\nSunlight helps plants prepare food. The Sun also provides \nall the living beings on Earth with heat and light. It is their \nmain source of energy. \nHave you seen solar panels on \nrooftops, on top of street lights or \non traffic signals? The solar panels \ncapture the Sun’s energy and \nproduce electricity. Energy from \nthe Sun can also be directly used \nfor cooking in a solar cooker or \nfor heating water in a solar water \nheater.\nThe \ncow is standing \nin the Sun. But it \ndoes not mean that it \nis getting energy from \nthe Sun.  \nThe \ncow is eating \ngrass. Grass leaves \nneed sunlight to grow. So, \nthe main source of energy \nis the Sun.  This way the \ncow gets energy from \nthe Sun.\nIn many households in India, water is offered to the Sun early \nin the morning as an expression of gratitude to the Sun.\nDo you \nknow?\nAccording to you, \nwhose statement \nis correct and \nwhy?\n?\nUses of solar energy\nSolar panels\nSolar water heater\nNo, I think \nthis cow \nis getting \nenergy from \nthe Sun.  \nLook at this \ncow. It is \ngrazing the \ngrass and \ngetting energy \nfrom it. \nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nOne cannot imagine life on \nEarth without the Sun. The Sun is \nthe main source of energy on the \nEarth. Plants get energy from the \nSun and produce food. Animals eat \nplants and grow. We get food from \nboth plants and animals. This cycle \non Earth is possible due to the Sun. \nSo, we all are dependent on the \nSun as the main source of energy. \nWhere do we find a large variety of \nplants or animals? Let us explore. \n11.4 Forests \nOne morning, Ajji takes Bhoomi and Surya for a walk in \nthe forest. They find a variety of herbs, shrubs and trees in \nthe forest. Ajji explains, “Forests are large areas with dense \ngrowth of various types of plants.” On the way, they collect \nsome nellikai (Kannada term for Indian gooseberries) \nthat have fallen on the ground. Ajji tells them, “We have a \ntradition in the village not to pluck fruits from the trees; \nthey are left for animals and birds to eat.”\nWhat will happen if the Sun \nis not visible for a few days?\n1. \u0007We may have to depend \non artificial lighting \nduring day time also.\n2.  \n3.   \n?\nA forest\nReprint 2025-26\nNature’s Treasures\nDiscuss with your friends and make a list of at least five \nproducts that we get from forests. \nForests are a natural home for many wild animals, \nincluding birds and insects. Forests provide food and shelter \nto them. In nature, every animal depends on other life forms \nfor survival. The diversity of life forms ensures food for every \nliving being. However, over the years, the forest cover has \nbeen decreasing, mainly due to human activities like large \nscale cutting of trees. It takes many years to grow a new \nforest or restore lost forests. Therefore, we must preserve \nand use forests responsibly so that they get enough time \nto regenerate.\nVan Mahotsav is a week-\nlong event celebrated across \nthe country during the month \nof July. It is a forest festival \nduring \nwhich \nnew \nplants \nand trees are planted, and \nawareness about respecting \nforests is raised. The aim of the \nevent is to increase the green \ncover. You too can plan a Van \nMahotsav in your community.\nFrom ancient times, India had a tradition \nof respecting, protecting and preserving \nforests. You have already learnt about \nsacred groves in the chapter ‘Diversity \nin the Living World’. Many efforts \nhave been made by common people \nto prevent the cutting of trees, and \nthus, saving forests. One such \neffort is the famous Chipko \nmovement. It started in the \nearly 1970s in Uttarakhand (previously part of Uttar \nPradesh). Local women actively participated in this \nmovement. They encircled and hugged the trees to \nprotect them from being felled. \nDo you \nknow?\nWhat are the consequences of \ncutting a large forest area? Make \na presentation or do a role play, \nor write a story or a poem that \n?\nshows what could happen \nif we continue to cut down \ntrees in our forests.\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nDuring their walk in the forests, Bhoomi and Surya notice \nthat there are a lot of leaves on the ground and the soil feels \ndamp. Ajji explains, “The roots of plants hold on to the soil \nand prevent it from being washed away. The leaves that \nfall from the trees decay and enrich the soil with nutrients. \nThis soil is used by new plants and trees to grow. This is an \nexample of recycling in nature.” Let us investigate the soil in \nmore detail.\n11.5\tSoil, Rocks and Minerals \nBhoomi, Surya and Ajji come back \nhome from the forest. Bhoomi \nand Surya help Ajji in preparing \nthe soil in the garden for planting \nsome vegetables (Fig. 11.5). Ajji \nasks them to dig the soil gently \nand loosen the lumps. You have \nalready learnt in the chapter \n‘Living Creatures: Exploring their \nCharacteristics’ that for plants \nto grow,  the space between the \nsoil particles not only provides \nsufficient air but also space for the \nroots to grow easily. Bhoomi and Surya could see small \npebbles, the roots of plants and a few earthworms too in the \nsoil. Do you realise that earthworms are natural agents that \nhelp in turning and loosening the soil?\nWhile Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji, let us do our own \nexperiment by performing Activity 11.4.\nActivity 11.4:  Let us investigate\nFig. 11.5: Soil preparation for \nplanting vegetables\nCaution  \nRemember to wash your hands \nthoroughly after touching the \nsoil collected from different \nplaces.

There may be many small organisms that we \ncannot see with our naked eyes.  Plants and animals also \nbecome part of the soil as they decompose and decay. The \nsoil samples collected from different \nplaces may be of different colours \nbecause they may contain different \nmaterials. \nHave you ever wondered how \nsoil is formed? Soil is formed by the \ndisintegration (breaking apart) of \nrocks by actions of the Sun, water \nand living organisms over a long \ntime (thousands of years). There \nare different types of soils.

Soil is a precious treasure \nthat supports biodiversity. \nYou may have seen rocks in your surroundings. Rocks \nare used in the construction of houses, buildings, temples, \nroads, dams and table tops. Some rocks, like slate, are used \nfor roofing (Fig. 11.6) and laterite can be used as a building \nmaterial, like bricks (Fig. 11.7). Some of the important rocks \nare granite, sandstone and marble. Human beings have been \nusing rocks to make tools such as hand axes (Fig. 11.8a) and \narrowheads (Fig. 11.8b) since thousands of years. \nFig. 11.6: Rocks used for roofing\nFig. 11.7: Laterite rocks used as bricks \nFig. 11.8 (a): Hand axes\nMining of marble\nWhat are rocks made up of? \nThey are made up of minerals. \nImportant metals, such as \naluminium, \ngold, \ncopper \nand iron are extracted from \nminerals.

For example, the basic \nmobile phones that we use contain about a dozen minerals \nlike gold, silver, copper, cobalt, etc.\n Naturally occurring gold  \nSome minerals found in nature\nRocks play a vital role in our lives. It takes thousands to \nmillions of years to form rocks. Therefore, it is important to \nconserve and use them responsibly. Do you know how rocks \nand minerals are transported from one location to another? \nMost vehicles that we use for transportation use fossil fuels. \nLet us explore more about fossil fuels.\n11.6\tFossil Fuels\nFuel Station\nSurya, why do \ndifferent types \nof vehicles go \nto different \nfilling stations?\nThe reason is \nthat they use \ndifferent types \nof fuels. For \nexample, petrol \nand diesel.\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nLet us explore more about it by performing Activity 11.5.\nActivity 11.5: Let us conduct a survey\n\n\nConduct a survey of vehicles in your neighbourhood.\n\n\nWhich types of vehicles are there? What types of fuels \ndo they use? \n\n\nRecord the information that you collect in Table 11.3.\nEarlier, coal, wood and dung cakes were used \nas fuels for cooking. Nowadays, less polluting \nnatural gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) \nhave gradually replaced these domestic fuels. \nDo you \nknow?\nType of vehicle\nType of fuel used\nTable 11.3: Types of vehicles and fuels used\nWhat are the most common types of fuels used? Petrol \nand diesel are the two most widely used fuels for vehicles. \nPetrol, diesel and kerosene are obtained from petroleum. \nPetroleum along with natural gas and coal are commonly \ncalled fossil fuels. They are formed essentially from the \nremains of microorganisms and plants that got buried deep \ninside the earth, and were converted to petroleum, natural \ngas and coal. It takes millions of years for these fuels to form.\nNatural gas is used for cooking and generating electricity. \nNowadays, it is also used in the form of Compressed Natural \nGas (CNG) as a fuel for vehicles. It is a cleaner fuel than \npetrol or diesel. Coal is mainly used for the production of \nelectricity. It is found in several parts of India. Find out the \nmajor coal-producing states and mark them in a map of \nIndia.\nReprint 2025-26\nNature’s Treasures\nFossil fuels are found in limited quantities. Hence, we \nwill soon run out of fossil fuels if we continue to use them in \nthe manner that we currently do. To avoid such a situation, \nwe need to explore alternate sources of energy. When fossil \nfuels are burnt, smoke and carbon dioxide gas are produced \nwhich pollutes the air. Over-dependence on fossil fuels for \ntransportation and as domestic fuels has resulted in large \nscale air pollution.  \n11.7\tNatural Resources: renewable and  \nnon-renewable \nNature’s treasures fulfill our needs. They are essential \nresources to sustain all life forms on the Earth. For example, \nwe get heat and light from the Sun, water from rivers, and \nfood from plants and animals. These resources which we \nget from nature are called natural resources. We also \nuse natural resources to make many useful things for \nour convenience. For example, electric bulbs, furniture, \nsolar panels, bicycles, etc., make our lives comfortable. \nAll such resources created by human beings are called \nhuman-made resources. \nYou have learnt about various natural resources, such \nas air, water, energy from the Sun, forests, soil, rocks, \nminerals and fossil fuels. Some of these natural resources \nCoal\nPetrol\nNatural gas\nLet us do our bit to conserve the fossil fuels by—\n\n\nWalking or cycling to nearby places.\n\n\nUsing public transport.\nSuggest some more ways.\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nget replenished through natural processes over a period \nof time. If you remember, Ajji told Bhoomi and Surya that \nthey could collect only those nellikai that had fallen on the \nground. This makes sure that there would be enough fruits \nfor other animals and birds. The seeds from the droppings of \nanimals and birds would enable new trees to grow, though \nit would take some years before we get fruits from these \nnew trees. Thus, resources which get renewed, replenished \nor restored within a reasonable period of time are called \nrenewable resources. Air, water and forest are some of the \nexamples of renewable natural resources. Nature renews \nthem. We should use our natural resources judiciously. \nOn the other hand, fossil fuels take millions of years to \nform. They are found in limited quantities and once used, \nthey get exhausted. They are not produced or replenished \nwithin a reasonable period of time. These resources are called \nnon-renewable resources. Examples of non-renewable \nnatural resources are minerals, soil, rocks, coal, petroleum \nand natural gas.\n11.8 Resources we use\nIt is time for Bhoomi and Surya to go back home after a \nwonderful holiday at their Ajji’s home. Their Amma (mother) \ncomes to pick them up. Bhoomi and Surya show her the \nvegetable plants that have started to grow in the garden and \nthe dried chillies given by Ajji to take home.\nThey notice changes in the colour of the skyline and the \nsmell of the air once they reach the city. There are very few \ntrees. The air does not smell as good as the air at Ajji’s place. \nThey can smell smoke from the vehicles. The air is polluted. \nAmma says, “Yes. When we use fossil fuels in our vehicles, \nsmoke is generated. Now, there are vehicles which cause \nless pollution. For example, there are electric vehicles that \ndo not release any smoke. So, people are making an effort to \ncreate alternatives.” \nCan you list some alternatives for reducing air pollution?\nReprint 2025-26\nNature’s Treasures\nWe use many natural resources in our everyday life. \nLet us identify some resources that we use by performing \nActivity 11.6. \nActivity 11.6: Let us make a list of natural  \nresources used\nMake a list of activities you do in your daily life and write \ndown the natural resources used directly or indirectly for \neach activity.

Stars shine with their own light. \nSome groups of stars appear to form \npatterns which are like shapes of familiar \nthings. Long ago, when watching stars in \nthe night sky was a favourite pastime of our \nancestors, they identified these star patterns with animals, \nthings or characters in stories. Many cultures had names \nfor patterns based on their own stories. These imaginary \nshapes helped them in recognising stars in the sky. \nRecognising stars and their patterns was a useful skill \nfor navigation in the olden times. Before the arrival of \nmodern technology or even before the invention of the \nmagnetic compass, it helped people, particularly sailors \nand travellers, in finding directions at sea or on land. It is \nstill used in emergencies as a backup method.  \nIn earlier times, groups of stars forming patterns were \ncalled constellations. Currently, the regions of sky, which \ninclude these groups of stars, are defined as constellations. \nHowever, since in constellations, the patterns of stars are \noften the most prominent, the term constellation is still \ncommonly used for these groups of stars.\nDo we find patterns \namong the stars just \nfor fun or is there \nsome use of these \npatterns?\nSince different cultures denoted the constellation \nboundaries in different ways, an internationally agreed \nset of constellation boundaries were defined by the \nInternational Astronomical Union (IAU) in the early \ntwentieth century. 88 constellations were officially \nlisted, thus, dividing the entire sky into 88 regions.  \nThese regions of sky are now defined as constellations.\nMore to \nknow!\nSome constellations are shown in Fig. 12.3. The stars \nare joined by imaginary lines, drawn for easy identification. \nThe constellation Orion is often represented as a hunter. \nThere are three stars in the middle, which represent the belt \nof the hunter.

If you stay in a big city, you may find that \nthe sky is rarely clear and only a few stars are seen in the \nnight sky. This is due to light pollution, smoke and dust. The \npresence of excessive artificial light at night time is referred \nto as light pollution. In villages or areas where there is less \nlight pollution, a larger number of stars can be seen. Also, \nyour house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees, \nwhich may block your view. The night sky is best viewed \nfrom open dark areas. \nLight pollution is growing sharply globally. This is reducing our \nability to enjoy and study objects in the night sky. Some \ndark sky reserves and parks have been established \naround the world. Light pollution in the reserves is \ncontrolled to preserve dark skies for research.

To identify \na star or a constellation, you need to know \nhow a particular constellation looks like \nand where to look for it in the night sky. To \nget familiar with the pattern of a constellation \nyou may use images such as Fig. 12.3 and Fig. 12.4. \nTo find out when and in which portion of the sky a star or \na constellation will be visible from your location, you may \ntake the help of sky mapping apps that can be downloaded \non a mobile phone, or other online resources.\nSky Map is a very handy app for identification \nof stars, constellations and planets from mobile \nphones.

Look at the two stars present at the end of the \nBig Dipper’s cup and imagine a straight line passing \nthrough these towards the north. At about five times \nthe distance between these two stars, the imaginary \nline will lead to another star which is not very bright. \nThis star is the Pole Star. \nYou may also locate the bright constellation Orion and the \nstar Sirius in the night sky. \nActivity 12.3: Let us try to identify \n\n\nIn India, Orion is best viewed during the months of \nDecember to April after sunset. So, look for it during \nthat period. \n\n\nThree bright stars in a short straight line \nare located around the middle of Orion \n(imagined to be the belt of a hunter). \nIdentify these three stars first, as this is \nthe easiest way to find Orion.  \n\n\nOnce you identify Orion, it is easy to \nlocate the very bright star Sirius which is \nlocated close to Orion. Imagine a straight \nline passing through the three middle \nstars of Orion and look along this line \ntowards the east.

The Sun gives out a huge \namount of energy, and that is why it glows so brightly. \nWhich \nstar is \nclosest to \nus?\nReprint 2025-26\nBeyond Earth\nFig. 12.6: The rising Sun\nThe Sun, being the brightest \nobject and the source of light \nand heat on Earth, was elevated in most \nancient civilizations to the status of a deity. \nIn India, the Sun is worshipped as Sūrya. The \nheat provided by the Sun keeps the Earth \nat a temperature that makes life possible. \nSunlight is essential for plants to grow, \nwhich provide food and oxygen to animals, \nincluding humans. The Sun is responsible for \nclimate, seasons, weather, water cycle, \nwinds—all of which are important for \nsustaining life on the Earth. \nThe distance of the Sun from the Earth is about 150 million km. \nA useful unit for expressing distances within the solar system \nis ‘astronomical unit’ (au) which is approximately the \ndistance between the Sun and the Earth.\nThe Sun produces heat and \nlight, and is the main source \nof energy on the Earth \n(Fig. 12.6).\nHow big is the Sun? It is \nabout 100 times bigger than \nthe Earth in diameter. And \nstill, it looks so small because \nit is very far from the Earth.\nHowever, the Sun is much closer to us than the other stars \nhence it appears much bigger than the stars. As the stars \n(other than the Sun) are much farther away, they appear \nlike points, even though some of those stars are much bigger \nOur \nSun is also a \nstar. So how is it that \nthe Sun appears big and \nlights up the sky while the \nother stars look like bright \ndots in the night sky and \nare not even visible \nduring the day time?\nMore to \nknow!\nReprint 2025-26\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nthan our Sun. During daytime, due to the extreme brightness \nof the Sun, it is not possible to view the other stars.\nWhile revolving around the Sun, the Earth is also \nrotating about its axis. For one full rotation, the \nEarth takes about 24 hours which is called a day. \nLike the Earth, other planets also rotate about \ntheir axes while revolving around the Sun.  You \nwill learn more about this in the next Grade.\nMore to \nknow!\nPlanets\nA planet is a large, nearly spherical object that revolves \naround the Sun. Our Earth is a planet as it revolves around \nthe Sun as shown in Fig. 12.7. The Earth takes nearly one \nyear to complete one revolution. Like the Earth, there are \nother planets that revolve around the Sun.\nThe star nearest to us after the Sun is Proxima \nCentauri which lies at a distance of about \n269000 au. This means that its distance is about \n269000 times our distance to the Sun.\nMore to \nknow!\nThere are many more objects \nin the sky.  Our Earth, along \nwith some of these objects, \nand the Sun together form \nour Solar System (Fig. 12.7). \nMost of these objects move \naround \nthe \nSun. \nThe \nmovement of an object around \nthe Sun is called revolution.\nAre stars the only \nobjects in the sky? \nOr, are there more \nobjects which \nwe may not have \nnoticed? \nReprint 2025-26\nBeyond Earth\nFig. 12.7: An artist’s representation of the Solar System \n(To fit this figure within the page, the sizes and distances of various objects are not as per their \nactual sizes and distances in relation to each other, that is, the sizes and distances are not to \nscale in the figure)\nEarth\nVenus\nMercury\nAsteroid \nBelt\nSun\nMars\nJupiter\nSaturn\nUranus\nNeptune\nFrom ancient times, various names have been used \nacross India for the planets visible to the naked eye. \nFor example, Budha (Mercury), Śhukra (Venus), \nPṛithvī (Earth), Mangala (Mars), Bṛihaspati or Guru \n(Jupiter) and Śhani (Saturn). \nMore to \nknow!\nThe eight planets, in order of their increasing distance \nfrom the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, \nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune (Fig. 12.7). \nThe inner four planets nearest to the Sun—Mercury, \nVenus, Earth and Mars—are smaller in size. They have solid \nsurfaces with rocks on them. \nReprint 2025-26\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nVenus is usually seen shining brightly at dawn and dusk, \nand is commonly called the Morning Star or the Evening \nStar, even though it is not a star. Mars is called the Red Planet \nbecause it appears red. This is because the soil on Mars is \nreddish in colour.\nA large portion of the Earth’s surface is covered with \nwater and thus, it appears blue from the space. Due to this, \nthe Earth is also called the Blue Planet. \nThe four outermost planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and \nNeptune—are much larger compared to the Earth, and are \nmostly made of gases. These giant gaseous planets have \nlarge flat ring-like structures around them which are made \nof dust particles and rocky material. \nPlanets get most of their energy from the Sun. So, \nthe farther they are, the colder they are in general. The \npresence of an atmosphere on a planet can trap heat which \ncan significantly change the temperature of a planet. That is \nwhy Venus, for example, is hotter than Mercury, although it \nis farther from the Sun. \nThere is another object called Pluto that lies farther than Neptune, \nand revolves around the Sun. It is smaller than the Earth’s \nMoon. When it was discovered, it was called a planet of the Solar \nSystem. But later, when similar more small objects \nwere discovered, the International Astronomical \nUnion (IAU) in 2006 redefined the requirements of \nan object to be called a planet. As per this definition, \nthese smaller objects, including Pluto, are now called \ndwarf planets. \nMore to \nknow!\nCan we identify \na planet also, \nthe way we \nidentified the \nconstellations?\nAmong the planets, it is \neasiest to identify Venus \nwhich is very bright. After \nthe Sun and the Moon, Venus \nis the brightest object in the \nsky. Mercury, Mars, Jupiter \nand Saturn can also be seen \nwith the naked eye. They are \nReprint 2025-26\nBeyond Earth\nso far away that they look like shining dots, just like stars. \nSo how can we distinguish between planets and the stars? \nUnlike planets, the stars appear to twinkle a lot. \nActivity 12.4: Let us try to identify \n\n\nFor most of the year, Venus can be \nlocated either at dawn or at dusk. \n\n\nWhen you are viewing at dawn, \nlook for it near the Eastern \ndirection before sunrise. \n\n\nWhen you are viewing at dusk, look \nfor it near the Western direction after \nsunset.\nWhile many of the objects in the sky can be seen \nwith our naked eyes directly, we can see them brighter \nand larger using a pair of binoculars or an instrument \ncalled a telescope (Fig. 12.8). A telescope also helps us \nview many dim objects not visible by our naked eyes \ndirectly.\nYou may get an opportunity to view the sky through \na telescope whenever a night sky watching event is \norganised in your region.\nMany Higher Education \nInstitutions conduct night \nsky watching activities for \nschool students. There are \nmany Amateur Astronomy \nClubs all over the \ncountry which \norganise sky \nwatching events \nperiodically. Museums \nand Planetariums \nalso organise similar \nevents.\nDo you \nknow?\nHow can we \nsee the planets \nwhich are not \nvisible to the \nnaked eye?\nWe know that \nplanets move \naround the Sun. \nAre there any \nobjects that move \naround planets?\nFig. 12.8: A telescope\nReprint 2025-26\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nNatural Satellites\nObjects that move around planets are commonly called \nsatellites. They are smaller in size than planets. Moons are \nnatural satellites of planets. The Earth has one Moon, while \nMars has two moons. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \nhave a large number of moons. \n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 12.9: The Moon  \n(a) Image taken by Cartosat, ISRO.  \n(b) Close-up image by cameras onboard Chandrayaan-3, ISRO.\nThe Moon\nEarth’s natural satellite, the Moon, \ntakes about 27 days to complete \none revolution around the Earth. \nIt is our nearest neighbour in the \nspace. Unlike on the Earth, there \nis hardly any atmosphere on \nthe Moon. How big is the Moon \nas compared to the Earth? The \nMoon is about a quarter the size \nof the Earth in diameter. The \nMoon’s surface shows circular \nbowl-like structures called craters \n(Fig. 12.9). Most of these craters \nhave been formed due to the \nimpact of asteroids or rocks \nfrom \nthe \nspace \nhitting \nthe \nMoon’s surface. Since there is no \nIn general, any object \nthat moves around a \nmuch larger object can \nalso be called a satellite. \nFor example, Earth can \nbe considered \na satellite of \nthe Sun.\nThe Moon \nis about 3,84,000 km \naway from the Earth.\nMore to \nknow!\nReprint 2025-26\nBeyond Earth\nTo improve our understanding of the Moon, India’s ﬁ rst mission to \nthe Moon, Chandrayaan-1, was launched in 2008 and the second \nmission, Chandrayaan-2, in 2019. The third mission, Chandrayaan-3, \nwas launched in July 2023 and its Vikram lander carrying the Pragyan \nrover successfully soft-landed on the Moon on 23 August 2023. With \nthis mission, India became the ﬁ rst country in the world to \nachieve a landing near the little explored Moon’s south pole. \nTo mark this success, the Government of India declared \n23 August to be celebrated as ‘National Space Day’ in India. \nA fourth mission, Chandrayaan-4, is being planned which \naims to bring back soil and rock samples from the Moon.\nDo you \nknow?\nAsteroids\nThe Sun and the planets are nearly spherical in shape. There \nare many small objects in the Solar System which are rocky \nand irregular in shape. These are called asteroids. Many of \nthese asteroids revolve around the Sun \nin paths that lie between those of Mars \nand Jupiter. This region is called the \nasteroid belt (Fig. 12.7). Occasionally, \nasteroids pass very close to the Earth. \nComets\nSometimes we have visitors from the \nouter regions of the Solar System! These objects with long \ntails are called comets (Fig. 12.10). They are made up of dust, \ngases, rocks and ice.

Comets appear dim as \nthey move away from the Sun and then, it is not possible to \nsee them with the naked eye. \nMany comets have been \nfound that revolve around \nthe \nSun. \nThese \ncomets \napproach close to the Sun \nperiodically. However, there \nare a few comets that escape \nand move out of the Solar \nSystem. Few other comets \nget broken up, or fall into the \nSun or other planets when \nthey approach them.\nFig. 12.10: A Comet\nWe have learnt about the \nobjects which form the Solar \nSystem. Which are these objects? \nThe Sun, eight planets, their \nmoons, \nand \nmany \nsmaller \nobjects \nincluding \nasteroids, \nand comets, together form the \nSolar System.\nThe Sun—our star—is the \nlargest and the heaviest object \nin the Solar System. The Sun \nproduces almost all the energy in \nthe Solar System. All other objects \nin our Solar System shine due to \nthe sunlight that they reflect from \ntheir surfaces. \nIn Sanskrit and a \nfew other Indian \nlanguages, a comet \nis called Dhūmaketu. \nVarious tribes in \nIndia also call it Pucchya-Taro \n(star with a tail) or Zendya-\nTaro (star like a flag). \nIn many cultures, comets have \nbeen feared and it was earlier \nbelieved that comets bring \nbad luck. However, thanks to \nscientists, we now know that \nthese are just icy-rocky visitors \nmaking a trip close to the Sun!  \nOne famous comet is the \nHalley’s Comet which appears \nevery 76 years.

What do you think are the reasons behind \nit? Different students might have chosen different common \nfeatures for the grouping. For example, some students may \nhave chosen the height of plants as the basis for grouping \nwhile others might have chosen presence or absence of \nflowers as the basis for grouping of plants (See Fig. 2.2). \nReprint 2025-26\nDiversity in the Living World\nYou may have grouped animals based on varied features, \nsuch as what they eat, where they live, what colour they are \nand how they move.\nWhat is the importance of grouping? Grouping makes it \neasier to understand and study plants and animals on the \nbasis of their similarities and differences. \nYou will learn more about the importance of grouping in \nour daily lives in the chapter, ‘Materials Around Us’.\n2.2.1\tHow to group plants? \nYou must have noticed that plants show variation in the \nfeatures related to stems, leaves, flowers, and more. The \nstems of different plants vary in thickness, height, and \nhardness, while the leaves vary in shape, colour, size and \narrangement. You might have tried grouping the plants in \nActivity 2.3 using one of these features.\nYou might have also learnt in earlier classes that plants \ncan be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their \nheight and types of stem. Let us study the features of plants \nin more detail and group them on that basis.\nActivity 2.4: Let us group\n\n\nLet us go on a nature walk again for some more \ninteresting observations.\n\n\nLook closely at the height of different plants. Are \nthese plants shorter than you, as tall as you, or taller \nthan you? \n\n\nIs the stem brown or green? Touch and feel the stems \nand try to bend them gently.

How \ncan you group plants as herbs, shrubs, \nand trees based on the data entered in \nTable 2.3? \nSome plants grow really tall and have \nhard, thick, brown, and woody stems. \nTheir branches typically start higher up \non the stem and away from the ground. \nThese plants are called trees. For \nexample, a mango tree (Fig. 2.3a).\nTable 2.3: Grouping of plants based on height and nature of stem\nReprint 2025-26\nDiversity in the Living World\nFig. 2.4: Leaves showing different types of venation\n(a) Hibiscus leaf with \nreticulate venation\n(b) Banana leaf with \nparallel venation\n(c) Grass leaf with \nparallel venation\nSome plants are not as tall as trees. These plants often \nhave many brown woody stems that start branching very \nclose to the ground. These stems are hard but not as thick \nas the stem of a tree. These plants are called shrubs. For \nexample, a rose plant is a shrub (Fig. 2.3b).\nSome plants are typically small with soft and green stems. \nThese are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a \nherb (Fig. 2.3c).\nSome plants with weak stems need support to climb and \ngrow, and are called climbers. Some plants creep along the \nground and are called creepers.\nWhat can be other features on the basis of which you can \ngroup plants? Let us perform another activity.\nActivity 2.5: Let us compare\n\n\nLook at the leaves of different plants collected by you, \nduring the nature walk. \n\n\nDo you notice any variation in the shape and structure \nof these leaves?\nYou may observe thin lines on the leaves of the plants \n(Fig. 2.4a). These are veins. The pattern of veins on the leaf \nis called venation. What differences do you see in the veins \nof leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b?\nIn some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of \nveins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is \ncalled reticulate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus \nexhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you \nmay observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called \nparallel venation. For example, the leaves of banana plants \nand grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c).\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nDo you think that plants can be grouped on the basis of \nvenation present in their leaves?\nNow, let us try to explore roots of the plants. Do all plants \nhave roots? Are these roots similar? \nActivity 2.6: Let us find out\n\n\nVisit an open area where wild herbs and grasses are \ngrowing. You may use small herbs for this exercise. \n\n\nUsing a khurpi (trowel), carefully dig out a few different \nherbs without damaging the roots. To do this, you may \nwet the soil and loosen it. \n\n\nWash the roots with water and observe them. \n\n\nAfter you are done observing, make sure to replant the \nherbs so that they may continue to thrive and grow.\nWhat are the similarities and differences in the roots of \nthe plants collected by you? What differences do you see in \nthe roots of plants shown in Fig. 2.5a and Fig. 2.5b?\nCarefully observe the roots of a mustard plant in \nFig. 2.5a. The roots of this plant consist of one main root \nand small side roots arising from it. The main root is called \ntaproot. Another example of a plant having taproots is \nhibiscus observed by you in Activity 2.1. The plant in \nFig. 2.5b is a common grass plant. The roots of this plant \nappear as a bunch of similar-sized thin roots arising from \nthe base of the stem. Such roots are called fibrous roots \n(Fig. 2.5b). Does your collection include any other grasses? \nWhat kind of roots do they have? \nFig. 2.5: Types of roots\n(a) Taproot system in \na mustard plant\n(b) Fibrous root system \nin common grass\nReprint 2025-26\nDiversity in the Living World\nIs there any relation between the type of leaf venation \nand the type of root of the same plant?

Examples of such plants can include lemongrass, \nmarigold, sadabahar (periwinkle), and others. \n\n\nBefore planting them, observe their roots and the \nvenation in their leaves. \n\n\nRecord your observations in Table 2.4. \nTable 2.4: Types of leaf venation and roots\nS. no.\nName of the \nplant\nType of leaf \nvenation \n(reticulate/\nparallel) \nType of root \n(fibrous/tap)\n1.\nLemongrass\nParallel\nFibrous\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nDo you observe any relation between the leaf venation \nand types of root in these plants? A sadabahar plant has \na taproot and its leaves have reticulate venation. Do \nother plants with reticulate venation have taproots too? \nLemongrass, on the other hand, has fibrous roots and its \nleaves have parallel venation. Do other plants with parallel \nvenation have fibrous roots too? Generally, plants with \nreticulate venation have taproots while those with parallel \nvenation have fibrous roots. \nChickpea (chana) is another example of a plant with \ntaproots and reticulate venation in leaves. Wheat is an \nexample of a plant with fibrous roots and parallel venation \nin its leaves. \nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nIs there any relation among the seed of a plant, types of \nroot and leaf venation? Are all seeds similar?\nActivity 2.8: Let us compare\n\n\nSoak some chickpea and maize seeds in water for two \nor three days. \n\n\nRemove the seed coat of a chickpea. Now, observe the \nstructure of the chickpea and maize seeds. Are they \nsimilar or different?\nYou would notice that chickpea seeds are split into two \nparts (Fig. 2.6a). Each part is called a cotyledon. Plants that \nhave seeds with two cotyledons are called dicotyledons \n(dicots). Maize has a single thin cotyledon (Fig. 2.6b). Plants \nwith such seeds are called monocotyledons (monocots). \nWhat relation do you observe among leaf venation, root \ntypes and the number of cotyledons in seeds of a plant? \nDicot plants have reticulate venation and a taproot system \nwhile monocot plants have parallel venation and a fibrous \nroot system.\nYou have learnt about some features used for grouping \nplants. Now, let us explore the grouping of animals in more \ndetail.\n2.2.2\tHow to group animals?\nJust like plants, animals too are significantly different from \none another. How can we group such a wide variety of \nanimals? What features can you think of to group them? In \nActivity 2.3, you have already set some bases for grouping \nanimals. Let us explore a few of these in more detail.\nFig. 2.6: Dicot and monocot seeds\n(b) Monocot seed (maize)\n(a) Dicot seed (chickpea)\nCotyledons\nReprint 2025-26\nDiversity in the Living World\nFig. 2.7: Diversity in animals\nActivity 2.9: Let us find out\nYou have recorded the movement of a few animals in \nTable 2.2.

They may use wings, legs, and other parts \nthat help them to move. Here, we have identified animals \nbased on the types of movement and the body parts used \nfor movement. How can we group animals based on their \nmovements? Additionally, many animals differ from each \nother in shape, size, structure, colour, and other features. \nSome of these features can also be used to group animals in \nvarious ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important \nfor understanding their diversity.\nJanaki Ammal (1897–1984) was an Indian \nbotanist dedicated to environmental work and \nhelped to document and preserve India’s rich \nplant biodiversity. She played a key role in the \n‘Save Silent Valley’ movement. As the head \nof the Botanical Survey of India, she initiated \nprogrammes to document the plant diversity \nof India.\nKnow a scientist\nReprint 2025-26\nDiversity in the Living World\nMore to \nknow!\nSuccess Story—Save Silent Valley Movement\nThis is a real story of a forest in the Palakkad district of \nKerala. It is about preserving untouched beauty of a moist \nevergreen forest and its rich biodiversity. The now-famous \nSilent Valley was saved by a remarkable movement led by \ncommon people who were not even residing in the vicinity of \nthe forest. The battle against the proposal of a hydroelectric \ndam across the Kunthipuzha river persisted for 10 years. At \nthat time, people used all possible available means, such as \nwidespread awareness programmes, letters to editors, articles \nin, newspapers, seminars, and petitions and appeals in court. \nThe movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley.\n2.3 Plants and Animals in Different \nSurroundings \nYou might have observed during nature walks that \ndifferent \nanimals \nlive \nin \ndifferent \nsurroundings. \nYou have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. \nDoes the movement of these animals depend upon their \nsurroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. \nFishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and \nfins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy \nareas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes \nand shapes of animals also differ from one another.\nFig. 2.8: Body parts used by animals for movement\n(b) A goat walks on the ground \nwith the help of legs\nLegs\n(a) A fish swims in water \nwith the help of fins\nFins\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nS. \nno.\nIn the \ndesert\nOn \nmountains\nIn the \nocean\nIn the \nforest\nAny other \nregion\n1.\nCamel\nDeodar tree\nFish \nLion\n2.\nAny other\n3.\nActivity 2.10: Let us compare and analyse\n\n\nLook at Table 2.6. Recreate a similar table on the \nblackboard. \n\n\nList the names of plants and animals you or your \nclassmates have observed in the regions given in the \ntable or already know about. A few examples are given. \nYou can add more.\nTable 2.6: Animals and plants found in different surroundings\nWhat are your observations \nregarding plants and animals \nfound in various regions? Discuss \nyour observations with your \nclassmates.\nYou might observe from Table \n2.6 that the plants and animals \nfound in one kind of region are \ndifferent from those found in \nanother kind of region. \nFig. 2.9: Cactus with thick and \nfleshy stems in a desert \nFig. 2.10: A deodar \ntree in the mountains\nDuring a discussion in the classroom, \nAlex recalls that he observed cactus \nplants with thick and fleshy stems in \nthe deserts of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.9). Maya \nshares that she saw deodar trees in \nthe Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh \n(Fig. 2.10). These trees are conical in \nshape and have flexible and sloping \nbranches. \nNotice that these two types of plants \nfound in different regions are different \nReprint 2025-26\nDiversity in the Living World\nfrom each other. Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of \na region vary from that of another? Let us find out.\nThere is very little water available in the deserts. A hot \ndesert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at \nnight. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these \nareas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions \nduring the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems \nof plants found in the desert can store water and help them \ntolerate the hot conditions in these places. \nThe mountains in extremely cold regions experience \nfrequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, \nsome of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off \neasily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees \nenable them to do so easily.\nYou must have understood by now that the biodiversity \nvaries from region to region because of diverse conditions.\nLook at the images of a camel from the hot desert of \nRajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of \nLadakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe \nbetween them? What advantages do these differences \nprovide to these camels?\nThe camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. \nAlex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs \nand wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy \ndesert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the \nheight and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively \nshorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs \nallow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.\nFig. 2.11: A camel living in the hot \ndesert of Rajasthan\nHooves\nFig. 2.12: A camel living in the \ncold desert of Ladakh\nHooves\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nIn deserts, food is not available easily. Camels store food \nin their humps. Camels found in the hot desert have one \nhump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of \nfood. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. \nThese two humps shrink in late winters because there is not \nmuch food available in the cold desert and they have to use \nfood stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they \ngrow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive \nthe cold winters of Ladakh. \nWhat other features can help camels to survive in the \ndesert?\nOther students also start sharing their observations. \nKashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small \namounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. \nAs camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they \ncan survive for many days without drinking water. \nMaya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright \nflowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. \nHere, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller \nleaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain \ntops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she \nhas observed rhododendrons in the nearby mountains to \nbe taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons \nmay exhibit different features in different regions to survive \nthe conditions of those regions.\nSagar tells his classmates that he went to the Andaman \nand Nicobar Islands with his parents for a special event. \nHe saw huge whales and colourful fish in the ocean. His \nfather explained that the streamlined body of fish helps \nthem to swim in water. \nFig. 2.13: Different features of rhododendrons\nReprint 2025-26\nDiversity in the Living World\nWe have learnt that the plants and animals living in a \nparticular region have special features that make them fit \nto survive there. The special features that enable plants \nand animals to survive in a particular region are called \nadaptations.\nThe shape of the deodar tree and the height of the \nrhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive \nin the mountainous regions. \nThe place where plants and animals live is called their \nhabitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea \nor the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold \ndesert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. \nThe habitat of plants and animals provides them food, \nwater, air, shelter and other needs for their survival. Many \ntypes of plants and animals may share the same habitat. \nHabitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity \nof a region.\nWhat are the different ways in which you can group \nplants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to \ngroup them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live \nin water’. \nThe plants and animals that live on land are said to live in \nterrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats \nare forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains.\nSalim Ali (1896–1987) travelled across India \nto observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list \nof birds and documented their travel routes \nand habitats. He recorded the regions with \nhigh diversity of birds and took measures to \nconserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park \nin Bharatpur, Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird \nSanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of \nregions he preserved. He wrote a landmark series \nof 10 books on birds of the Indian Subcontinent. \nHe is referred to as the ‘Birdman of India’. He was \nawarded Padma Vibhushan in 1976.\nKnow a scientist\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nThe plants and animals that live in water are said to live \nin aquatic habitats. Some examples of aquatic habitats are \nponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSome animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as \non land. These are called amphibians.\nWhat would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal \nis damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass \nto eat? Can a fish survive without water? \nCheck with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours \nto know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal \nthey used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see \nas often now. These changes often happen when habitats \nare damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals \nresults in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. \nThis leads to the loss of biodiversity.\nThe population of the Bengal Tiger, Cheetah, and Great Indian \nBustard has declined in India due to loss of natural habitats \ncaused by human activities. The Government of India has \ninitiated several projects to conserve our biodiversity. ‘Project \nTiger’ was initiated in 1973 to protect the declining population \nof the Bengal Tiger. The ‘Cheetah Reintroduction Project’ was \ninitiated in 2022 to restore the population of the Cheetah. \nSimilarly, habitats of the Great Indian Bustards have been \ndeclared as Protected areas in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan \nand Maharashtra.\nBengal Tiger\t\n\t\n     Cheetah\t\n\t\n     Great Indian Bustard\n Do you \nknow?\nReprint 2025-26\nDiversity in the Living World\nKeywords\nMore to \nknow!\nTraditionally Protected Forests: Sacred Groves\nSacred groves are undisturbed patches of forests.

There is a significant difference between \ntraditional and modern culinary practices. Earlier, most \ncooking was done using a chulha (Fig. 3.1a). Nowadays, most \nof us cook using a modern gas stove (Fig. 3.1b). Earlier, most \ngrinding was done manually using a sil-batta (Fig. 3.1c). \nThese days, we use an electrical grinder for ease of grinding \n(Fig. 3.1d). Find out what were the other ways of cooking \nand grinding. Why have these culinary practices changed \nover time? These changes may be due to factors such as \ntechnological development, improved transportation and \nbetter communication.\n3.2 What are the Components of Food?\nMedu and Mishti visit the ‘Traditional Food Festival’ \norganised in their school. The theme of the festival is ‘Eat \nHealthy, Live Healthy’. \nThe festival features various stalls displaying different \nkinds of traditional dishes. Dr Poshita, a nutritional expert, \nexplains to students that ʻHealth is the Ultimate Wealthʼ. \nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nLet us understand what Dr Poshita means by this \nstatement. \nHave you ever missed a meal? How do you \nfeel when you miss a meal?\nWe feel tired and less energetic when we do not \neat for some time. Why do you think a marathon \nrunner drinks glucose water during and after a race?\nGlucose \nprovides \ninstant \nenergy. Glucose is an example of \na carbohydrate. Carbohydrates \nare one of the primary sources \nof energy in our diet. Cereals like \nwheat, rice, and maize, vegetables \nlike potato and sweet potato, and \nfruits like banana, pineapple, \nand mango are some sources of \ncarbohydrates (Fig. 3.2).\nDo you know that common \nsugar is also a type of carbohydrate?\nWhy do you think we prefer to have laddoos as a part of \nour traditional diet in winters? \nBesan or wheat flour (aata) and ghee \nare among the main ingredients of \nladdoos along with goond (edible \ngum), nuts, and seeds. Ghee and \nvarious kinds of oils are grouped \nunder \nanother \nkind \nof \nfood \ncomponent, which is called fat.\nYes, my grandma told \nme that laddoos rich in \nghee and nuts provide \nenergy to keep us warm. \nSources of fats can be from \nplants or animals (Fig. 3.3). Nuts, \nsuch as groundnuts, walnuts, \ncoconuts, and almonds, and \nseeds, such as pumpkin seeds \nand sunflower seeds, are some \nsources of fat.

People get proteins from plants as well as animals. \nSome excellent plant sources of protein are pulses, beans, \npeas and nuts (Fig. 3.4a). Animal sources of protein are milk, \npaneer, egg, fish and meat (Fig. 3.4b). Protein-rich foods help \nin growth and repair of our body. These are, therefore, called \nbody-building foods. \nFig. 3.4: Some sources of proteins\n(a) Plant sources\nGram\nMoong\nTuar Dal\nKidney beans\nPeas\nSoya bean\n (b) Animal sources\nFish\nEggs\nPaneer\nChicken\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nCase 1\nIn earlier times, during long voyages, sailors often suffered \nfrom bleeding and swollen gums. During a voyage in 1746, \nScottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who \nconsumed lemons and oranges recovered from these \nsymptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a \ndisease called scurvy.\nCase 2\nIn the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the \nhuman population in the Himalayan region and \nthe Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling \nat the front of the neck were prevalent. As per \nnorms of the Government of India, an effort was \nmade to supplement common salt with iodine for \npreparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised \nsalt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were \ndue to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting \nin a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling \nat the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre.\nThe right amount of protein must be included in the diet of \ngrowing children for their proper growth and development. \nWhich of these food components are part of your daily diet?\nHave you ever seen mushrooms?

Lemons and oranges help in curing scurvy. Scurvy \nis caused due to deficiency of Vitamin C. Vitamin C present \nin citrus fruits like lemons and oranges helps in curing this \ndisease.\nReprint 2025-26\nMindful Eating: A Path \nto a Healthy Body\nHow would you find out more about other food \ncomponents that protect our body from various diseases?\nActivity 3.4: Let us conduct a survey\n\n\nStudy the chart given in Fig. 3.5 to explore the functions \nand sources of various food components.

These nutrients protect our body from diseases and \nkeep us healthy. Your parents may have advised you to have \nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nmilk, green vegetables, fruits and wholegrains regularly. \nThese food items are some sources of vitamins (Fig. 3.6) and \nminerals. Although vitamins and minerals are required in \nsmall amounts, they are essential to keep our body healthy. \nWhat differences do you observe in raw and cooked \nvegetables? Have you ever noticed that vegetables \nsometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and \nless crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and \nothers are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it \nnot be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into \nour diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may \nalso result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is highly \nrecommended that all fruits and vegetables be thoroughly \nwashed before consumption. \nFruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see \nhow dietary fibres are beneficial for us.\nIn addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary \nfibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do \nnot provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an \nessential component of our food. They help our body get rid of \nundigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage \nin our food is provided mainly by suitable plant products. \nDo we obtain all \nnutrients from \nplants and animals?\nNo, Medu. Nutrients like \nsalt can be obtained from \nseawater or from rocks. \nAlso, Vitamin D can be \nnaturally produced by our \nbody upon exposure to \nsunlight.\nReprint 2025-26\nMindful Eating: A Path \nto a Healthy Body\nGreen \nleafy \nvegetables, \nfresh fruits, wholegrains, \npulses and nuts are good \nsources of roughage. \nEating food that is \nlocally grown and plant \nbased, to the extent possible, is \nnot only healthy for the body but is also good for \nour environment and our planet. \nWater is also an essential \npart of our diet. It helps the \nbody absorb nutrients from \nfood. It removes waste from \nthe body \nthrough sweat \nand urine. We should drink \nsufficient water regularly to \nkeep ourselves healthy.\nMy grandma has difficulty in \npassing stool. Now I understand \nwhy the doctor advised her to \neat food that is high in fibre.\nColuthur Gopalan (1918–2019) initiated \nnutrition research in India. He analysed \nmore than 500 Indian foods for their \nnutritional value and recommended an \nappropriate diet in the Indian context. \nHe led surveys on the nutritional status \nof the Indian population, identifying \nwidespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food \ncomponents. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day \nMeal Programme in 2002, now a ‘PM POSHAN’ initiative, \nto provide balanced food in the government-run and \ngovernment-aided schools of our country. This scheme \nhas played a role in improving the health and nutrition of \nmillions of children nationwide.\nKnow a scientist\nWhat are the \nfood sources that \nprovide water to \nour body?

That is the reason they are \nalso called nutri-cereals. They contribute significantly to \na balanced diet required for the normal functioning of \nour body. \nPackaged food items must have information about \nthe nutrients on their cover. The information should \nlist the amount of each nutrient. Sometimes, more \nnutrients are added to the food during processing \n(fortification) to improve its nutritional quality. \nIodised salt and some baby foods are examples \nof fortified foods.

Her grandmother \nloves listening to her stories, so \nReshma was writing a new story \nto share with her grandmother \non her 60th birthday. \nExploring Magnets\nThe story was based on a ship \ncarrying spices from Kerala for \ntrade in the olden days. Reshma \nwas aware that in those days, \nthe sailors used stars to find \ndirections at night. But in her \nstory, a situation arose wherein \nthe sailors got caught in a storm \nwith an overcast sky and stars \nwere not visible. Reshma could not take her story forward \nas she could not think of a way for sailors to find directions. \nShe searched for information on the internet and her \nschool library. She learnt that the travellers used a device, \nknown as a magnetic compass, for finding \ndirections.  \nReshma had seen pencil boxes and \npurses which had magnets to keep them \nclosed. A writing board in her school \nalso had a duster with a magnet. But \nshe had never looked at those carefully. \nShe now became curious to learn more \nabout magnets and magnetic compasses.\nReprint 2025-26\nThe magnets used by sailors in the olden days were based \non naturally occurring magnets, known as lodestones which \nwere discovered in ancient times. Later on, people found \nout that magnets could also be made from pieces of iron. \nNowadays, we have magnets made of different materials. \nThe magnets that you find in your school laboratory and \nthose used in pencil boxes, stickers, toys are all artificial \nmagnets (Fig. 4.1). The magnets can be of various shapes, \nsome of which are shown in Fig. 4.2.\nFig. 4.1: Some common items that have magnets attached to them\n4.1 Magnetic and Non-magnetic Materials \nActivity 4.1: Let us explore\n\n\nCollect a few objects made of different materials and \nalso a magnet. \n\n\nPredict which of the objects will stick to the magnet. \nWrite your prediction in Table 4.1. \n\n\nNow hold a magnet in your hand and bring it near \nthe objects one by one (Fig. 4.3).

Which \nmaterials stuck to the magnet? What conclusion can you \ndraw?\nThrough this activity, we found out that some of the \nobjects were attracted to the magnet and stuck to it, while \nothers were not. The materials which are attracted towards \na magnet are called magnetic materials. \nThe metal iron is a magnetic material. \nNickel and cobalt are other metals that are \nalso magnetic. Some of their combinations \nwith other metals are also attracted \ntowards magnets. The materials which are \nnot attracted towards a magnet are called \nnon-magnetic materials. \nWhich materials listed in Table 4.1 were \nfound to be non-magnetic? \n4.2 Poles of Magnet\nActivity 4.2: Let us investigate\n\n\nSpread some iron filings (very small pieces of iron) on a \nsheet of paper. \n\n\nPlace a bar magnet over them. Tap the paper and \nobserve carefully what happens to the iron filings. \nDo you observe anything special about the way they stick \nto the magnet? Do the iron filings stick all over the magnet \nuniformly? Or do the iron filings stick more at some places? \nWe find that maximum iron filings stick near the ends of \nthe bar magnet, as shown in Fig. 4.4, while a very few iron \nfilings stick at the remaining part of the magnet.\nFig. 4.4: Iron filings sticking \nto a bar magnet \nDo all parts of a \nmagnet attract \nmagnetic \nmaterials \nequally?\n?\nIf we repeat this \nactivity with \nmagnets of other \nshapes, do we get \nthe same result?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nReprint 2025-26\nIf we have noticed the direction \nwhere the Sun rises or sets, we \nhave an approximate idea of \nwhere East or West is. Hence, we \ncan locate the direction along \nwhich the magnet rests.\nThese ends of the magnet are called the \ntwo poles of the magnet—the North pole and \nthe South pole. Most of the iron filings stick \nto the poles of a magnet of any shape. \nIt is not possible to obtain a magnet with \na single pole. If a magnet is broken into \nsmaller pieces, North and South poles always \nexist in pairs even in the smallest piece of the magnet. \nA single North pole or a South pole cannot exist.\n4.3 Finding Directions\nActivity 4.3: Let us experiment\n\n\nSuspend a bar magnet with a thread tied to the middle of \nthe magnet as shown in Fig. 4.5. You may need to adjust \nthe position of the string till the magnet is balanced \nhorizontally.\n\n\nNow rotate the magnet gently in the \nhorizontal direction and let it come to rest. \n\n\nMark the position corresponding to the \nends of the magnet on the ground (or on \na piece of paper stuck to the ground). Join \nthese two points on the ground with a \nline. This line indicates the direction along \nwhich the magnet comes to rest. \n\n\nNow again rotate the magnet by giving a \ngentle push at its one end and wait till it \ncomes to rest. Does the magnet rest along \nthe same line?\nFig. 4.5: A freely suspended \nbar magnet\nCan we find \na magnet \nwith a \nsingle pole? ?\nWhat direction does \nthis line indicate \nalong which the \nmagnet rests? How \ncan we find it out?\nExploring Magnets\nReprint 2025-26\nA freely suspended magnet comes to rest along the \nnorth-south direction. The end of the magnet that points \ntowards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or \nthe North pole of the magnet. The other end that points \ntowards the South direction is called the South-seeking \npole or the South pole of the magnet. A freely suspended \nmagnet rests along the north-south direction because our \nEarth itself behaves like a giant magnet.\nRepeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of \nthe bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest \nalong north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along \nany direction. This implies that only magnets rest along \nnorth-south direction. This activity provides us with a way \nto test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. \nThe property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest \nalong the north-south direction is used to find directions. \nBased on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was \ndeveloped in olden days for finding directions. It \nhas a magnet in the shape of a needle which can \nrotate freely (Fig. 4.6). The needle of a magnetic \ncompass indicates the north-south direction.\nThe compass is kept at the place where we \nwish to know the directions. After some time, the \nneedle comes to rest in the north-south direction. \nThe compass box is then gently rotated until the \nnorth and south marked on the dial are aligned \nwith the needle. Now all directions at that place \nare as indicated on the dial.\nA magnetic compass is usually a small circular box \nwith a transparent cover on it, as shown in Fig. 4.6. \nThe magnet, in the shape of a needle, is mounted \non a pin standing on the bottom of the box. This \nneedle is balanced on the pin in such a \nmanner that it can move around this point \neasily, that is, it can rotate freely. The end of \nthe needle which rests in the North direction \nis usually painted red. Below the needle, \nthere is a dial with directions marked on it. \nHow can we \nmake our \nown magnetic \ncompass?\nMore to \nknow!\nFig. 4.6: A magnetic \ncompass\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nReprint 2025-26\nActivity 4.4: Let us construct\n\n\nCollect a few materials like a cork piece, iron sewing \nneedle, a permanent bar magnet, a glass bowl, and water.\n\n\nPlace the iron sewing needle on a wooden table.

Our handspans are of \ndifferent sizes.”\nAnish gives an idea, “Let us check this.”\nSo, all five of them put their handspans along each \nother and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their \nhandspans are different.\nDeepa says thoughtfully, “No wonder people use scales \nand measuring tapes.”\nDeepa and her friends compare the length of the table \nwith the length of their handspans. The length of the table is \nexpressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan \nused for measurement is an example of a unit. And the length \nis expressed in two parts, a number and a unit. For example, \nif the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then \n13 is the number and ‘handspan’ is the unit selected for the \nmeasurement.\nHowever, handspans and other similar units, such as \nlength of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to \nperson. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which \nmeasurements of the same length made by different people \ndo not differ.\nTable 5.1: Measuring the length of the table\nName of the Student\nNumber of Handspans\nAnish\nSlightly more than 13\nPadma\nTasneem\nSlightly less than 13\nDeepa\nBetween 13 and 14\nHardeep\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nIndia has a rich history of measurement \nsystems dating back to ancient times. Angula \n(finger width), multiples of angula, dhanusa, \nand yojana are some of the units mentioned \nin ancient Indian literature, and used in \nmeasuring artefacts, architecture, and \ntown planning. The angula is still used by \ntraditional craftspeople like carpenters \nand tailors. Several objects with ruled \nmarkings which could be scales have been \nexcavated from sites of the Harappan \nCivilisation. \nMore to \nknow!\nFig. 5.2:  \nA metre scale\n5.2 Standard Units\nSeveral systems of units evolved with time in \ndifferent parts of the world. However, when \npeople started travelling from one place to \nanother, it created a lot of confusion. This led \nto the different countries coming together \nand adopting a set of standard units of \nmeasurement. The system of units now used is \nknown as the ‘International System of Units’ or \nSI units. \nThe SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol \nis  m. A metre scale is shown in Fig. 5.2. One \nmetre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. \nEach division is called a centimetre (cm). You \nmay be familiar with a smaller part of the \nmetre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in \nFig. 5.3.\nLook carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has \nmarkings (in  cm) from 0 to 15. The length \nof any section between two consecutive big \nmarks, such as between 1 and 2 or between \n5 and 6, is 1  cm. Observe that these sections \nReprint 2025-26\nMeasurement of Length and Motion\nFig. 5.3: A 15-cm scale\nof 1  cm length are further divided \ninto 10 equal parts. The length of \none of these smaller parts is called \na millimetre (mm). 1 mm is the \nsmallest value of length that you \ncan measure using this scale. 1 mm \nis equal to one-tenth of a centimeter \n(1 mm = 0.1 cm).\nFor measuring larger lengths, we \nuse a larger unit called a kilometre \n(km) which is equal to 1000 metres. \nAnd for measuring smaller lengths, \nwe use units such as centimetre or \nmillimetre. \n1 km = 1000 m\n1 m = 100 cm\n1 cm = 10 mm\nWould it be convenient to use \nthe unit metre to measure \nlarger lengths, such as the \nlength of a railway track \nbetween two cities, or to \nmeasure smaller lengths, \nsuch as the thickness of a \npage of a book?\n?\nIn some scales, you might have noticed another scale \nmarking. This scale marking is in inches, where  \n1 inch = 2.54 cm. In earlier days, units, such as inch and foot, \nwere used to measure length. These units are still used by \nsome people.\nDo you \nknow?\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n5.3 Correct Way of Measuring Length\nFor measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale. \nFor example, if you want to measure the length of your \npencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of \na room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a \nmeasuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a \ntree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such \nmeasurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor’s \ntape is more suitable. \nWhile measuring lengths, we need to take care of some \npoints. \nWhat is the correct way to place the scale?\nPlace the scale in contact with the object along its length as \nshown in Fig. 5.4.\nFig. 5.4: Method of placing the scale\n(b) Incorrect\n(a) Correct\nWhat is the correct position of the eye while reading \nthe scale?\nFor example, if you are trying to measure the length of a \npencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye \nshould be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5).\nNo, but we should \nfirst learn the correct \nway of using a scale \nto measure length.\nSuppose we all measure \nthe length of the table \nagain, but this time using \na metre scale. Will our \nresults still be different?\nReprint 2025-26\nMeasurement of Length and Motion\nHow to measure the length if the ends of the scale \nare broken?\nIf the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking \nis not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With \nsuch a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 \ncm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this \nmark from the reading at the other end. For example, in \nFig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other \nend, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is \n10.4 cm–1.0 cm = 9.4 cm. \nFig. 5.6: Correct method of placing the scale with broken end\nHow do visually challenged students measure lengths? \nThey use scales with raised markings that can be felt by \ntouching them. \nFig. 5.5: Correct position of the eye is ‘B’\nB\nC\nA\nDo you \nknow?\nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nObject\nLength of the object\nWhile writing the length, do not forget \nto write the unit also. Thus, your result \nwill consist of two parts—one part is a \nnumber and the other part is the unit of \nmeasurement.\nSome of your friends in the class \nwould have measured the length of the same \nobjects. Compare the lengths measured by you with that of \nyour friends. Are the measured lengths the same or slightly \ndifferent? If not the same, discuss the possible reasons for \nthe differences.\nWhy are some \nlength measuring \ndevices made \nup of flexible \nmaterials?\nUnits of length, such as kilometre, metre, centimetre and \nmillimetre, begin with a lowercase letter, except at the \nbeginning of a sentence. Their symbols km, m, cm and \nmm are also written in lowercase letters, and are never \nfollowed by ‘s’ for the plural. Note that a full stop is not \nwritten after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. \nWhile writing the length, always leave a space between the \nnumber and the unit.\nActivity 5.1: Let us measure \n\n\nSelect some objects around you, such as a comb, a pen, \na pencil, and an eraser to measure their lengths. \n\n\nMeasure their lengths one by one using a metre scale \nand note down the measurements in Table 5.2.\nTable 5.2: Measuring lengths \nDo you \nknow?\nReprint 2025-26\nMeasurement of Length and Motion\n5.4 Measuring the length of a curved line\nAnish and his parents fixed electric string lights on the \narches  of the verandah of their \nhouse, as shown in Fig. 5.7, for a \ncelebration at home.

If, instead, each of them had thought of distances \nfrom a same object or point, say, the bus stand, then their \nobservations would have been the same. \nWhen distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or \npoint, then this point is called a reference point.\nA few days later, Hardeep tells his friends excitedly, \n“Let us all go to the playground. The sports teacher wants \nus to help her to draw lines with chuna powder (limestone \npowder) for making the Kabaddi court for the sports day.” \nPadma: “We will need a longer measuring tape.

On one of the kilometre stones, it \nwas written ‘Delhi 70 km’ (Fig. 5.12).\nFurther on, the next kilometre stone \nread ‘Delhi 60 km’. Each kilometre stone \nindicated that she was getting closer to her \ngrandparents’ house.\nThese kilometre stones indicated \nher distance from Delhi. So, Delhi is \nthe reference point in this situation.\nFig. 5.13: Positions of kilometre stones with respect to Delhi as a reference point\nIf the kilometre stone reads ‘Delhi 70 km’ as shown in \nFig. 5.13, we can say that the position of Padma is 70 km \nfrom Delhi. When the kilometre stone reads ‘Delhi 60 km’, \nthe position of Padma is 60 km from Delhi.\nWhat do such \nkilometre stones \nindicate? How could \nPadma conclude that \nshe was getting closer \nto her destination?\n?\nFig. 5.12: \nA kilometre stone\nDoes this mean that the position of \nPadma, with respect to the reference \npoint, is changing with time?

How can one \ndecide if an object is in motion or at rest?\nAn object is said to be in motion if its position changes \nwith respect to the reference point with time. If an object is \nnot changing its position with respect to the reference point \nwith time, it is said to be at rest.\nReprint 2025-26\nMeasurement of Length and Motion\nDeepa looked around her in the bus and noticed that all \nthe passengers were seated. She looked around again after \na minute and found them still occupying their seats. She \nwondered, ‘Are they moving?’ She concluded that the position \nof the passengers was not changing with time. Therefore, they \nwere certainly at rest. However, when she looked outside, she \nfelt they were in motion as their positions were changing with \nrespect to things outside.\nThe reference point is important in deciding whether an object \nis at rest or in motion. If Deepa considered herself (or \nthe bus) as the reference point, then the passengers \nwere at rest. However, if she considered any object \noutside the bus (say a building) as the reference point, \nthen the passengers (and the bus) were in motion.\nSuppose you are travelling on a ship which is \nmoving at a constant speed along a straight \nline on a calm sea.

For example, a pen may be made up of \ndifferent materials like plastic, metal and ink.\nWould it be a \ngood idea to \nuse paper-like \nmaterials for \nmaking cooking \nutensils? \n?\nWhy cannot a \ntumbler made of \ncloth be used for \nstoring water?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nReprint 2025-26\nActivity 6.4: Let us explore \nFig. 6.3 illustrates a variety of balls that are of the same size \nbut made up of different materials. \n\n\nTake each ball and drop it from a fixed height. \n\n\nNote the height to which the ball bounces and record it \nin Table 6.2. \n\n\nIdentify the ball that achieves the highest bounce.\nFig. 6.3: Different types of balls used for various purposes \nTennis ball\nCricket ball\nHand exercise ball\nCan a cricket ball \nbe used to play \ntennis?\nTable 6.2: Bouncing level of the balls\nBall\nBounce (high, medium or low)\nTennis ball\nCricket ball\nHand exercise ball\nAny other\nWhy are different \nmaterials used for \nmaking balls for \nvarious sports? \nMaterials Around Us\nReprint 2025-26\nFig. 6.4: Grouping of objects\nDiscuss in class other properties of sports balls, such as size, \ncolour, texture and how high they bounce and understand \nwhy balls are made up of specific materials for specific sports.\nObserve Fig. 6.4 and group the objects in as many different \nways as possible.\nYou might have grouped \nthese objects according to \ntheir shapes or by their \ncolour or materials they are \nmade up of.\nWe \nhave \nlearnt \nthat \nmaterials may be classified on \nthe basis of their properties. \nFor \nexample, \nin \nthe \nkitchen, we usually store \nthings in such a manner \nwhere similar utensils are \nplaced together. Similarly, a grocer usually keeps all types \nof spices in one corner, pulses and grains in another corner \nand so on. You may also visit any chemist shop and enquire \nabout how medicines are arranged.\n6.3\t What are the different Properties of \nMaterials?\nLet us learn some more properties of materials.\n6.3.1 \u0007Observe and identify appearance of materials\nMaterials often look different from each other. Freshly cut \nwood, which is unpolished, has a distinct appearance, quite \ndifferent from that of iron. Similarly, iron looks different \nfrom copper or aluminium. However, there might be some \nsimilarities among iron, copper and aluminium that make \nthem different from wood.\nLet us do a sorting challenge! Collect small pieces of paper, \ncardboard, wood, chalk, copper wire, aluminium foil and any \narticle made up of brass, bronze, steel, etc. Take a look at the \npieces you have collected. Do any of these materials shine \nwhen light falls on them? Observe their texture (whether \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nReprint 2025-26\nrough or smooth), colour and other noticeable features, \nand record your observations in the notebook. Group the \ncollected pieces based on their appearance.\nMaterials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to \nhave a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are \nusually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, \naluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their \nlustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due \nto the effect of air and moisture on them. As \na result, we often notice the lustre only on \ntheir freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous \nmaterials are those that do not have a shiny \nsurface. Some examples of non-lustrous \nmaterials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc.\n“All that glitters is not gold” goes an old \nsaying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. \nSurfaces of some materials are made shiny by \npolishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, \nwax or any other material which makes them look \nshiny. These materials may not be metals. \n6.3.2 Which materials are hard?\nWhen you press different objects or materials with your \nhands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, \nwhile others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take \na metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of \nwood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other \nmaterial or object. Can some materials be scratched more \neasily than others? Materials which can be compressed or \nscratched easily are soft, while other materials which are \ndifficult to compress or scratch are hard. However, these \nproperties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is \nharder than sponge but softer than iron.\nActivity 6.5: Let us observe \n\n\nHold the objects given in Table 6.3 with your hands.\nFeel whether the objects are hard or soft. Find out the \nmaterials they are made up of.

Ghulan hides behind a wall, Sheeta hides \nbehind a big tree in the garden while Sara hides behind \nthe frosted glass door (which has a hazy surface). Sheeta’s \nyounger brother can see all of this happening through a \nglass window of his house. \nThe materials, through which things can be seen clearly, \nare called transparent. Glass, water, air, cellophane paper, \netc., are some examples of transparent materials.\nWhy did Ghulan, Sheeta and Sara choose these places to hide?\nDo you think it would be possible for Sheeta’s brother to \nsee her and her friends through a closed wooden window of \nthe house?\nObject\nHard/Soft\nMaterial(s)\nBrick\nHard\nBaked clay\nWater bottle\nPillow\nTumbler\nTable\nSweater\nAny other\nTable 6.3: Hard or soft objects and the materials \nthey are made up of\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nReprint 2025-26\nThere are many materials through which you are not \nable to see at all. These materials are called opaque. Wood, \ncardboard and metals are examples of opaque materials.\nThe materials through which objects can be seen, but not \nclearly, are known as translucent. Butter paper and frosted \nglass are examples of translucent materials.\nLook at Fig. 6.5.

Ghulan’s mother mixed a spoonful of sugar, \na pinch of salt and some lemon juice in a glass \ntumbler of water and offered him this shikanji \n(lemonade) to drink.\nGhulan noticed that while his mother was \nmixing sugar and salt in water, the salt and the \nsugar disappeared after a while. \nLet us try a simple activity to explore how \ndifferent materials behave when we mix them \nin water!\nActivity 6.7: Let us explore \n\n\nCollect small amounts of sugar, salt, chalk powder, sand \nand sawdust. \n\n\nTake five glass tumblers and fill them about two-third \nwith water. \n\n\nPut a teaspoonful of sugar in the first glass tumbler, salt \nin the second one, chalk powder in the third, sand in the \nfourth and sawdust in the fifth glass tumbler. \n\n\nOn stirring, predict what will happen in each case.\n\n\nUse a spoon to stir well the contents of each glass tumbler. \n\n\nWait for a few minutes and watch what happens. \n\n\nWrite down your observations in Table 6.5.\nTransparent\nTranslucent\nOpaque\nTable 6.4: Classification of objects\nIs water \ntransparent? \nCan it \nbe made \nopaque? ?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nReprint 2025-26\nYou might have noticed that some materials \ncompletely disappear when mixed in water. \nWe say that these materials dissolve in \nwater or, in other words, they are soluble \nin water (Fig. 6.6a). Some materials do not \nmix with water and do not disappear even \nafter we stir them for a long time.

If these are not available, \nORS can be prepared at home by mixing six teaspoons of sugar and \nhalf a teaspoon of common salt in one litre of boiled and cooled water.\nSome liquids get completely mixed with water. Some do \nnot mix with water and form a separate layer when left \nundisturbed for some time. Similarly, some gases are soluble \nin water whereas others are not.

She reciprocates and deliberately \nsays, “Please keep your bags on your seats and sit down.” \nStudents are not able to sit because bags are kept on their \nseats. Madam Vidya asks, “Why are you not sitting?” The \nstudents reply that there is no place to sit because the bags \nhave occupied that space.\nContinuing the conversation, \nshe provides two identical glass \ntumblers to two students and \nencourages them to pour the \nremaining water from their \ndrinking \nwater \nbottles \ninto \nthe respective glass tumblers. \nOn pouring water in the glass \ntumblers, the students observe \nthat one glass tumbler gets half-\nfilled with water (Fig. 6.8a) while \nthe other is almost completely \nfilled with water (Fig. 6.8b).\nMaterials Around Us\nReprint 2025-26\nWhy is the level of water different in the two tumblers?\nMadam Vidya elaborates that both tumblers have the \nsame capacity. The water levels differ in each case, which \nindicates that the amount of water in each tumbler is \ndifferent. \nThe water in the first tumbler occupies less space, \nindicating that the volume of water in this tumbler is less \nthan the water in the other tumbler. The space occupied by \nwater represents its volume.\nYou may have noticed drinking water bottles of different \nsizes being sold in the market. Have you noticed 1 L, 500 mL, \n200 mL, etc., written as net quantity on the bottles? These \nindicate the volume of water in the bottles.\nThe bottles of drinking \nwater and milk are \nlabelled as 500 mL, \nindicating the volume.\nDrinking\n water\n500 mL\nMilk\n500 mL\nWhy was I not able to \ntransfer water from the \njug into an empty water \nbottle completely? \nNow I know the reason \nbehind it …\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nReprint 2025-26\nNow you have become familiar with many properties \nof \nmaterials. \nHowever, \nall \nmaterials do not possess all \nthese properties. \nAre there any \nproperties which \ncan be shown by all \nmaterials? If yes, \nwhat are those?\n?\n6.4 What is Matter?\nMass and volume are the two \nproperties that are possessed \nby all materials. Can we give a \ngeneral name to anything that \npossesses these two properties? \nAnything that occupies space and has \nmass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter, \nand the units to measure it are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). \nThe space occupied by matter is its volume. The units to \nmeasure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL).\nKilogram is the unit of mass in the International System \nof Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. \nThere is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full \nstop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. \nWhile writing the mass, always leave a space between \nthe number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, \nif we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as \n7 kg and not as 7 kgs.\nSimilarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and \nmillilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ \nin mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, \nit would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower \ncase and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for \nvolume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m3. The \nabbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to \ndenote cubic metre. For example, if you have \nvolume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written \nas 2 m3. Always leave a space between number \n(numerical value) and the unit. 1 m3 =1000 L.\nDo you \nknow?\nMaterials Around Us\nReprint 2025-26\nCan all the materials around us be \nconsidered as different examples of \nmatter? Discuss with your friends.\nFor example, water is matter, sand and \npebbles are matter and so is the cup.\nMaterials are types of matter used in the \ncreation or making of objects.\nWe learnt that materials look different \nand behave differently. We grouped materials \non the basis of  similarities or differences in \ntheir properties. \nWe find grouping useful as it helps us study and \nobserve patterns in the properties of things. Humans have \nbeen classifying not only things, but also rocks, plants and \nanimals. We have learnt about the classification of the living \nworld in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Just like \nin the living world, classification of the non-living world is \nalso done on the basis of their properties.\nIs air \nmatter?\nYes! But most of the materials \nthat we see today would have \nalso existed earlier. I am \ncurious to know how people \nclassified them then.\nWe have explored \nand understood the \nvarious properties of \nmaterials.\nCan you think about what changes the \ninvention of plastic brought to humans? \nIs it a boon or a bane? \nThink it \nover!\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nReprint 2025-26\nKeywords\nOpaque\nNon-lustrous\nVolume\nTransparent\nTranslucent\nSoluble\nSoft\nExplore\nClassify\nRecord\nPredict\nObserve\nIdentify\nHard\nInsoluble \nLustrous\nMaterial\nMatter\nMass\t\nClassification\nA similar classification system existed in ancient India. \nAyurveda, one of the Indian medical systems, too has a \nsystem of grouping things.\nगुŁ मन्द हिम स्निग्ध श्‍लक्ष्ण सान्द्र मृददु स्थिराः|\nगुणणाः ससूक्ष्मम विशददा: विंशतिः स विपर्ययाः||\n(Aṣhtanga hṛidaya Sūtra sthāna 1.18)\nThe shloka precisely talks about the 20 properties (guṇa—ten \npairs of opposite properties), which are used to describe all \nphysical matter in Ayurveda.

A device that measures temperature is called \na thermometer.\nThere are two kinds of thermometers that you are \nlikely \nto \ncome \nacross—clinical \nthermometers \nand \nlaboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used \nto measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory \nthermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us \nnow learn more about thermometers and how to use them \nto measure temperature. \n7.3 \t Measuring Temperature\n7.3.1\t Clinical thermometer\nYou might be familiar with a thermometer, like that shown in \nFig. 7.2, which is used for measuring our body temperature. \nIt is called a clinical thermometer. Such thermometers show \ntemperatures digitally. These are also known as digital \nclinical thermometers and run on batteries. These measure \nThen how do we \nfind out how hot \nor cold a body \nis? \nFig.7.2: A digital clinical thermometer\nTip\nReprint 2025-26\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science| Grade 6\nDo you \nknow?\nEarlier, mercury thermometers were used for measuring \nthe body temperature. But mercury is an extremely toxic \nsubstance and is difficult to dispose of if the thermometer \nbreaks accidently. \nDigital thermometers pose no such risk and also the \nnumbers in its display are easier to read. Therefore, \nmercury thermometers are being replaced by digital \nthermometers. Temperature in a digital thermometer \nis determined with the help of heat sensors. \ntemperature when the thermometer is placed in contact \nwith a person’s body.\nFor measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers \ngenerally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this \nscale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is \ndenoted by °C.  \nThey are non-contact thermometers, \nalso called infrared \nthermometers. Such \nthermometers can \nmeasure temperature \nwithout touching a \nperson’s body and \nthus reduce the risk of \nspreading disease.\nDuring the COVID-19 \npandemic, some special \nthermometers were used, \nwhich could measure the \ntemperature of a person \nfrom a distance. What were \nthose?\nReprint 2025-26\nTemperature and its Measurement\nActivity 7.2: Let us measure\nLet us now use a digital clinical thermometer \nto measure body temperature. You may \nmeasure your own temperature as well as \nthe temperature of some of your friends. \nTalk to your friends to find out who would \nbe willing to get their body temperatures \nmeasured by you.\n\n\nWash your hands and the tip of the \ndigital thermometer with soap and \nwater.\n\n\nReset the thermometer by pressing the \nreset button. \n\n\nPlace the thermometer under the \ntongue and close your mouth. \n\n\nWait till the thermometer makes a \nbeeping sound or flashes a light.\n\n\nTake it out from the mouth and read \nthe temperature on the digital display. \n\n\nRecord the temperature in Table 7.1.\n\n\nClean the tip of the thermometer with soap and water, \nand dry it.\n\n\nRepeat the above steps for measuring the temperatures \nof your friends. \nTable 7.1: Body temperatures of 10 persons\nPrecautions  \nto be taken while  \nusing a digital clinical \nthermometer\n•\t\nTo be used after reading the \ninstruction manual of the \nthermometer. \n•\t\nTip of the thermometer to \nbe washed with soap and \nwater before and after use.\n•\t\nWhile washing, care to be \ntaken to keep the digital \nportion such as the display \nout of water.  \n•\t\nDo not hold the thermometer \nby the tip.  \nS. no.\nName\nTemperature (°C)\n1.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n10.\nReprint 2025-26\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science| Grade 6\nThe normal temperature of a healthy human body is taken \nto be 37.0 °C. But in this activity, did you find that the normal \ntemperature of every person was 37.0 °C? Or did you find the \ntemperature slightly higher or lower for some people?  \nThe temperature of every person may not \nbe 37.0 °C. What we call normal temperature \nis the average body temperature of a large \nnumber of healthy people. A perfectly \nhealthy person may, therefore, have a \nnormal temperature slightly different from \n37.0 °C. The body temperature is influenced \nby several factors, such as age, time of the \nday and activity level.\nYou may try measuring your own \ntemperature at different times of the day and \non different days. Record the thermometer \nreadings in your notebook. After a month, \nanalyse your temperature record and see if \nthere are any variations. If yes, try to think \nwhat might be the reasons for that. \nThe temperature of human beings does \nnot normally go below 35 °C or above 42 °C. \nFor measuring the body temperature \nof small children or old people, the digital \nthermometer can also be placed in the \narmpit. The temperature measured this way \nis about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual \nbody temperature.\nThere is another scale of temperature \nknown as Fahrenheit scale. On this scale, the \nunit of temperature is degree Fahrenheit and \nis denoted by °F.  A temperature measured as \n37.0 °C on Celsius scale is equivalent to 98.6 °F \non Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is \nnot used in most scientific studies anymore. \nIn scientific work, there is another scale of \ntemperature known as Kelvin scale. On this \nscale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and \nis denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature \nis kelvin.\nDo small children \ngenerally have \nslightly higher body \ntemperatures as \ncompared to adults? ?\nDo old people, even \nwhen healthy, generally \nhave lower body \ntemperatures than \nyoung adults?\n?\nI have seen a friend of mine \nusing a digital thermometer \nthat reads temperature on \na different scale. It shows \nthe normal temperature of \na healthy human body as \n98.6 °F.  What is the reason \nfor this difference?\nReprint 2025-26\nTemperature and its Measurement\nThe names of temperature scales—Celsius scale, \nFahrenheit scale and Kelvin scale—start with a capital \nletter. For the units for temperature, degree Celsius and degree \nFahrenheit, the word degree starts with a lower-case letter while \nCelsius and Fahrenheit start with a capital letter. The unit kelvin \nstarts with a lower-case letter. The symbols of all units (°C, °F, K) are \ncapital letters. Note that degree sign (°) is not written with K. A full \nstop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. \nWhile writing the temperature, a space is left between the number \nand the unit. For temperatures more than one degree, use the plural \nof ‘degree’, that is, ‘degrees’, while writing the full form of the unit.\nWe can easily convert the \ntemperature from Celsius scale to \nKelvin scale by using:\nTemperature in Kelvin  \nscale = Temperature in  \nCelsius scale + 273.15\nMore to \nknow!\nAll three temperature \nscales, Celsius, Fahrenheit \nand Kelvin are named in \nhonour of the scientists who \ndeveloped these scales.\nHow was fever detected before \nthermometers were developed? Fever \naffects the pulse rate of a person. This \nwas known even in olden days \nin India. However, apart from \nfever, some other situations \nalso affect the pulse rate. \nHence, pulse rate alone is not \na reliable indicator of fever.\nDo you \nknow?\nNo, the \ntemperatures of \nboiling water and \nice are outside the \nrange of a clinical \nthermometer. \nCan a clinical \nthermometer be \nused for measuring \nthe temperature of \nboiling water? Or \nfor measuring the \ntemperature of ice?\n?\nHow can we measure \ntemperatures beyond \nthe range of a clinical \nthermometer?\nReprint 2025-26\n Curiosity | Textbook of Science| Grade 6\nFig.7.3(a): \nA laboratory \nthermometer\nBulb\n7.3.2 Laboratory thermometer\nThere are many types of laboratory thermometers but the \none that might be available in your school laboratory may \nlook like the one shown in Fig. 7.3a. It consists of a long, \nnarrow, uniform glass tube which is sealed. At one end of \nthe tube is a bulb which contains a liquid. Outside the bulb, \nin the tube, a narrow column of liquid can be seen. There \nis a Celsius scale marked along the tube. The liquid column \nrises or falls with change in temperature. The mark of the \nCelsius scale with which the top level of the liquid column \ncoincides is the temperature reading.\nThe liquid used in the laboratory \nthermometer is generally alcohol (coloured \nred to make it easily seen) or mercury. \nDo you \nknow?\nActivity 7.3: Let us observe\nLet us try to find the temperature range of a given laboratory \nthermometer. \n\n\nTake a laboratory \nthermometer and observe it \ncarefully. \n\n\nNote down the following:\n—\n—\nWhat is the lowest \ntemperature it \ncan measure? \n—\n—\nWhat is the highest \ntemperature it \ncan measure? \n—\n—\nSo, the range of this \nthermometer is \nNow look at the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3a carefully. \nCan you tell its range?

Can you now find the smallest value that \nthis thermometer can read?\nFor the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3b, the \ntemperature difference indicated between 0 °C and \n10 °C or between 10 °C and 20 °C is 10 °C. And the \nnumber of divisions between these marks are 10 \ndivisions. So, one small division can read 10/10 = 1 °C. \nThat is, the smallest value that this thermometer \ncan read is 1 °C.\nYour school laboratory may have thermometers \nfor which the range and the value of the smallest \ndivision may be different. It is, therefore, always \nnecessary to look carefully at the thermometer you \nare about to use.\nYou have learnt how to find the temperature range \nof a given laboratory thermometer.

Where else have you seen water droplets \nlike this?  \nYou might have seen dew drops on \nplants. Why do we see dew drops more \nin the morning? When we boil the \nwater in a half-filled utensil and cover \nit with a steel plate, some water drops \naccumulate on the inner side of the steel \nplate. Where do these water drops come \nfrom? What do you think? \nWhen the water vapour present in the \nair comes in contact with a cold surface, \nit forms water droplets. The process of conversion of water \nvapour into its liquid state is called condensation. \nAfter understanding the concept of condensation of water, \nlet us go back to Activity 8.3. Could the water appearing on \nthe outer surface of the glass tumbler in Activity 8.3 also be \ndue to condensation of water vapour present in the air?

Explain your \nobservations.\nYou may observe some water \ndroplets on the glass tumbler. \nWater vapour from the air \ncomes in contact with the cold \nsurface of the glass tumbler \nand gets converted into water \ndroplets on the glass tumbler \nthrough condensation. There is an increase in the reading \non the digital weighing balance. Can we conclude that water \nis not seeping through the wall of the tumbler? Can we also \nconclude that the water collected outside the tumbler is only \ndue to condensation? No, we cannot say that conclusively \nfrom Activity 8.4.

This activity shows that water is not seeping from \nthe glass tumbler and the extra water is getting collected \nbecause of condensation.  \n8.3\t What are the different States of Water?\nWater is a substance that can be observed in three different \nstates in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On \nheating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. \nOn further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous \nstate. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties \nof different states of water.\nActivity 8.5: Let us identify \n\n\nPut an ice cube in one container and transfer it to \nanother container of different shape.

What \nhappens to its shape? \n\n\nPour water on a clean surface and observe how it \nspreads. \n\n\nWhen water gets converted into water vapour, how \ndoes this water vapour spread? Compare this with the \nspreading behaviour of water. \nTable 8.3: Compare different states of water  \nProperty\nIce  \n(Solid state)\nWater  \n(Liquid \nstate)\nWater  \nvapour \n(Gaseous \nstate)\nShape\nAbility to flow\nAbility to spread\nReprint 2025-26\nA Journey through States of Water\nWhat are the differences in the properties of water in \nsolid, liquid and gaseous states?\nIce (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the \ncontainer in which it is placed while water takes the shape \nof the container. Ice does not flow or spread.  \nWater (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water \ndoes not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the \ncontainer in which it is kept, but the volume of water remains \nconstant. Does water also possess the property to spread? \nYes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the \nvolume constant. \nWater vapour (gaseous state) exhibits a property of \nspreading out in the entire available space. Gases do not \npossess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room \ntemperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the \nair around us. The water that evaporates during processes \nlike drying of clothes or mopping of floors contribute to the \nwater vapour in the air around us. \nYou are now familiar with the three states of water. Some \nother substances also exhibit these states. For example, wax, \noil and ghee. Let us look at some more examples of solids, \nliquids and gases.\nLook around and find some examples of solid substances. \nSome examples could be stones, wood and glass.\nWhat are the other examples of liquids you can think of? \nHere are two examples— milk and oil. Think of five more \nexamples.\nHave you ever noticed that you can smell the food being \ncooked even without entering the kitchen? How does this \nsmell reach us? \nIt is because the smell of yummy food from cooking \nspreads through the air and reaches our nostrils, even if we \nare not in the kitchen.\nWhat are the other examples of gases you can think of? \nWhat about oxygen and carbon dioxide? \n8.4\t How can we change the States of Water? \nSo far we have learnt that water can exist in solid, liquid \nand gaseous states. How can you change the state of water? \nReprint 2025-26\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\nHow can you quickly change ice \nto its liquid state, water? \nIf we have to change ice  into \nwater, and water into water \nvapour, we have to supply \nheat to it. If we want to change \nwater into ice, what should be \ndone?\nIt can be done by placing \nwater in a cold environment, \nsuch as a freezer. Water freezes and is \nconverted into ice. If we take the ice out of the freezer, \nit melts and is converted into water. \nCan you think of any other example, besides water, that \ncan change from solid to liquid? \nA candle, which is made of wax, is one such example. \nHow can we turn candle wax into liquid state? How can \nwe change the liquid wax back into solid state? We should \ncool the liquid wax to change it into a solid. What are the \nother liquids you have seen which get converted into a \nsolid? Have you ever seen coconut oil getting converted into \nits solid state during the winter season? \nHence, we can see that water and other substances change \ntheir states on heating or cooling. The process of conversion \nof a solid into liquid state is called melting. The process of \nconversion of liquid into solid state is called freezing.\nLet us check the connection between different states of \nwater through Activity 8.6. \nActivity 8.6: Let us complete the diagram \nFill up the blank boxes in Fig. 8.5 marked as A, B, C and 1, 2, \n3, 4 for conversion of different states of water using the \nwords given in the box.

Aavi expresses surprise and \nasks, “Why is the water in the earthen pot so cold? I never \nobserved water getting cold in a stainless steel pot.” What \ndo you think is the reason?\n\t\nWater seeps through the surface of the \nearthen pot and evaporates, which imparts \na cooling effect on the water. What are the \nother examples of cooling effect? Sprinkling \nwater on the floor or the roof during summer \nto cool it, is another example.\nHow do you feel when you rub sanitiser on \nyour hands?\nLet us perform Activity 8.9 to observe the cooling effect \nby making a simple and electricity-free model of pot-in-pot \ncooler. \nActivity 8.9: Let us make a model  \n\n\nTake two earthen pots of different sizes. \n\n\nFill the bottom of the larger pot with a layer of sand.\n\n\nPlace the smaller pot into the centre of the larger one \nas shown in Fig. 8.7.\n\n\nFill the gap between the pots with more sand.\n\n\nPour water in the sand area.\nNow, \nI can understand \nwhy we feel cooler if we sit \nunder a fan!

When air moves \nhigher \nabove \nthe \nEarth’s \nsurface, it becomes cooler and \ncooler. At certain heights, the \nair gets so cool that the water \nvapour in it turns into droplets \nwhich are generally formed \naround dust particles.

It is done \non the basis of differences in size, colour and \nshape of the particles. If the particles to be \nremoved are present in small quantities and \ncan easily be picked by hand, handpicking \nproves to be a convenient method.   \nAt lunch, Malli and Valli are served \nsteaming \nhot \nvegetable \npulao. \nWhile \neating the pulao, Nani observes that \nMalli is separating whole black peppers \nfrom \nthe \npulao \nand \nis \nplacing \nthem \naside on his plate (Fig. 9.1).

In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a \n3-3-3-3… pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.).\nThe Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan, \nNepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and \nMyanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words \nlakṣha (लक्ष) and koṭi (कोटि‍). The American system is also used in many \ncountries.\nObserve the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore.\n1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes.\n1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes.\nA lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a \nlakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand \nis 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).\nHow many zeros does a thousand lakh have? _____\nLarge Numbers Around Us\nHow many zeros does a hundred thousand have? ____\nThe number 9876501234 can be easily read by placing commas first:\n(a)\t 9,87,65,01,234 → 9 arab 87 crore 65 lakhs 1 thousand and 234 \nor 987 crore 65 lakh 1 thousand 234 (in the Indian system).\n(b)\t 9,876,501,234 → 9 billion 876 million 501 thousand 234 (in the \nAmerican system).\nFigure it Out\n1.\t \tRead the following numbers in Indian place value notation and \nwrite their number names in both the Indian and American systems:\n(a)\t 4050678\t\n(b)\t\n(c)\t 20022002\t\n(d)\t\n(e)\t 345000543\t\n(f)\t\n2.\t \tWrite the following numbers in Indian place value notation:\n(a)\t One crore one lakh one thousand ten\n(b)\t \tOne billion one million one thousand one\n(c)\t \tTen crore twenty lakh thirty thousand forty\n(d)\t Nine billion eighty million seven hundred thousand six hundred\n3.\t \tCompare and write ‘<’, ‘>’ or ‘=’:\n(a)\t \t30 thousand ____  3 lakhs\n(b)\t \t500 lakhs ______ 5 million\n(c)\t \t800 thousand ____ 8 million \n(d)\t \t640 crore ______ 60 billion\nWe shall come across even bigger numbers in later grades.\n1.4 Exact and Approximate Values\n1 lakh people \nvisited the \nbook fair.\nOhh, so \nmany \npeople!\nIf I had not gone, \nthey would have \nwritten “99,999 \npeople visited the \nbook fair last week”.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nWhat do you think of this conversation? Have you read or heard \nsuch headlines or statements?\nVery often, exact numbers are not required and just an approximation \nis sufficient. For example, according to the 2011 census, the population \nof Chintamani town is 76,068.

For example, if a school has 732 people including students, \nteachers and staff: the principal might order 750 sweets instead of \n700 sweets.  \nThere are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down \nis when the approximated number is less than the actual number). For \nexample, if the cost of an item is ₹470, the shopkeeper may say that the \ncost is around ₹450 instead of saying it is around ₹500. \nThink and share situations where it is appropriate to (a) round up, \n(b) round down, (c) either rounding up or rounding down is okay and \n(d) when exact numbers are needed.\nLarge Numbers Around Us\nNearest Neighbours\nWith large numbers it is useful to know the nearest thousand, lakh or \ncrore. For example, the nearest neighbours of the number 6,72,85,183 \nare shown in the table below.\nNearest thousand     \n6,72,85,000\nNearest ten thousand     \n6,72,90,000\nNearest lakh     \n6,73,00,000\nNearest ten lakh     \n6,70,00,000\nNearest crore     \n7,00,00,000\nSimilarly, write the five nearest neighbours for these numbers:\n(a)\t 3,87,69,957\n(b)\t 29,05,32,481\nI have a number for which all five nearest neighbours are \n5,00,00,000.

Such phrases are called arithmetic expressions. \nEvery arithmetic expression has a value which is the number it \nevaluates to. For example, the value of the expression 13 + 2 is 15. This \nexpression can be read as ‘13 plus 2’ or ‘the sum of 13 and 2’.\nWe use the equality sign ‘=’ to denote the relationship between an \narithmetic expression and its value. For example:\n13 + 2 = 15.\nExample 1: Mallika spends ₹25 every day for lunch at school. Write \nthe expression for the total amount she spends on lunch in a week \nfrom Monday to Friday.\nThe expression for the total amount is 5 × 25.\n5 × 25 is  “5 times 25” or “the product of 5 and 25”. \nDifferent expressions can have the same value. Here are multiple \nways to express the number 12, using two numbers and any of the four \noperations +, – ,  × and ÷:\n10 + 2, 15 – 3, 3 × 4, 24 ÷ 2.\nChoose your favourite number and write as many expressions as you \ncan having that value.\nComparing Expressions\nAs we compare numbers using ‘=’, ‘<’ and ‘>’ signs, we can also compare \nexpressions. We compare expressions based on their values and write \nthe ‘equal to’, ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ sign accordingly. For example, \n10 + 2 > 7 + 1 \nARITHMETIC \nEXPRESSIONS\nArithmetic Expressions\n\u0007because the value of 10 + 2 = 12  is greater than the value of 7 + 1 =  8. \nSimilarly, \n13 – 2 < 4 × 3.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t \tFill in the blanks to make the expressions equal on both sides of \nthe = sign:\n(a)\t 13 + 4 = ____ + 6 \t\n(b)\t 22 +  ____  = 6 × 5   \n(c)\t 8 × ____ = 64 ÷ 2\t\n(d)\t 34 – ____ = 25\n2.\t \tArrange the following expressions in ascending (increasing) order \nof their values. \n(a)\t 67 – 19\t\n(b)\t 67 – 20\n(c)\t 35 + 25\t\n(d)\t 5 × 11\n(e)\t 120 ÷ 3\nExample 2: Which is greater? 1023 + 125 or 1022 + 128? \nImagining a situation could help us answer this \nwithout finding the values.

In such cases, we \nneed some tools and rules to specify how exactly the expression has to \nbe evaluated. \nTo give an example with language, look \nat the following sentences:   \n(a)\t Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a \nfriend with toys”.  \n\t\n\u0007Meaning: The friend has toys and \nShalini sat next to her.\n(b)   \u0007Sentence:   “Shalini sat next to a \nfriend, with toys”. \n\t\nMeaning: Shalini has the toys \nand she sat with them next to her \nfriend. \nThis sentence without the punctuation could have been interpreted \nin two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how \nthe sentence has to be understood.\nLet us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way.\nExample 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun \nbrought 5 bags of marbles with 4 marbles in each bag. How many \nmarbles did Mallesh and Arun bring to the playground?\nMallesh summarized this by writing the mathematical expression —\n30 + 5 × 4.\nArithmetic Expressions\nWithout knowing the context behind this expression, Purna found \nthe value of this expression to be 140. He added 30 and 5 first, to get 35, \nand then multiplied 35 by 4 to get 140.\nMallesh found the value of this expression to be 50. He multiplied 5 \nand 4 first to get 20 and added 20 to 30 to get 50. \nIn this case, Mallesh is right. But why did Purna get it wrong? \nJust looking at the expression 30 + 5 × 4, it is not clear whether we \nshould do the addition first or multiplication. \nJust as punctuation marks are used to resolve confusions in language, \nbrackets and the notion of terms are used in mathematics to resolve \nconfusions in evaluating expressions.\nBrackets in Expressions\nIn the expression to find the number of marbles — 30 + 5 × 4 — we had \nto first multiply 5 and 4, and then add this product to 30. This order of \noperations is clarified by the use of brackets as follows:\n30 + (5 × 4).\nWhen evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find \nthe values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing \nother operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value \nof 5 × 4, and then do the addition. Thus, this expression describes the \nnumber of marbles:\n30 + (5 × 4 ) = 30 + 20 = 50.\nExample 5: Irfan bought a pack of biscuits for ₹15 and a packet of toor \ndal for ₹56. He gave the shopkeeper ₹100. Write an expression that can \nhelp us calculate the change Irfan will get back from the shopkeeper.\nIrfan spent ₹15 on a biscuit packet and ₹56 on toor dal. So, the total \ncost in rupees is 15 + 56. He gave ₹100 to the shopkeeper. So, he should \nget back 100 minus the total cost. Can we write that expression as—\n100 – 15 + 56 ? \nCan we first subtract 15 from 100 and then add 56 to the result? We \nwill get 141. It is absurd that he gets more money than he paid the \nshopkeeper!\nWe can use brackets in this case:\n100 – (15 + 56).\nEvaluating the expression within the brackets first, we get 100 minus \n71, which is 29. So, Irfan will get back ₹29.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nTerms in Expressions\nSuppose we have the expression 30 + 5 × 4 without any brackets. Does \nit have no meaning? \nWhen there are expressions having multiple operations, and the \norder of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion \nof terms to determine the order.\nTerms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For \nexample, in 12+7, the terms are 12 and 7, as marked below.\n7\n+\n12 + 7 =\nWe will keep marking each term of an expression as above. Note \nthat this way of marking the terms is not a usual practice. This will be \ndone until you become familiar with this concept.\nNow, what are the terms in 83 – 14? We know that subtracting a \nnumber is the same as adding the inverse of the number. Recall that \nthe inverse of a given number has the sign opposite to it. For example, \nthe inverse of 14 is –14, and the inverse of –14 is 14. Thus, subtracting \n14 from 83 is the same as adding –14 to 83. That is,\n– 14\n+\n83 – 14 =\n \nThus, the terms of the expression 83 – 14 are 83 and –14. \nCheck if replacing subtraction by addition in this way does not change \nthe value of the expression, by taking different examples.\nCan you explain why subtracting a number is the same as adding its \ninverse, using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class \n6 textbook of mathematics? \nAll subtractions in an expression are converted to additions in this \nmanner to identify the terms.\nHere are some more examples of expressions and their terms:\n– 18\n– 3\n+\n–18 – 3 =\n6 × 5\n+\n6 × 5 + 3 =\n– 10\n+\n2 – 10 + 4 × 6 =\n4 × 6\n+\nNote that 6 × 5, 4 × 6 are single terms as they do not have any ‘+’ sign.\nIn the following table, some expressions are given. Complete the table.\nTry\nThis\nArithmetic Expressions\nExpression\nExpression as the sum of its terms\nTerms\n13 – 2 + 6\n– 2\n+\n+\n13, – 2, 6\n5 + 6 × 3\n6 × 3\n+\n4 + 15 – 9\n+\n+\n23 – 2 × 4 + 16\n+\n+\n28 + 19 – 8\n+\n+\nNow we will see how terms are used to determine the order of \noperations to find the value of an expression. \nWe will start with expressions having only additions (with all the \nsubtractions suitably converted into additions).\nDoes changing the order in which the terms are added give different \nvalues?\nSwapping and Grouping\nLet us consider a simple expression having only two terms.\nExample 6: Madhu is flying a drone from a terrace. The drone goes 6 m \nup and then 4 m down. Write an expression to show how high the final \nposition of the drone is from the terrace.\nThe drone is 6 – 4 = 2 m above the terrace. Writing it as sum of terms:\n– 4\n+\n=\nWill the sum change if we swap the terms?\n– 4\n 6\n+\n=\nIt doesn’t in this case.\nWe already know that swapping the terms does not change the sum \nwhen both the terms are positive numbers.\nWill this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as \nwell? Take some more expressions and check. \nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nCan you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of  \nintegers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? \nThus, in an expression having two terms, swapping them does not \nchange the value.\nTerm 1\nTerm 2\nTerm 2\n+\nTerm 1\n=\n+\nNow consider an expression having three terms: (–7) + 10 + (–11). Let \nus add these terms in the following two different orders:\n– 7\n 10\n+\n– 11\n+\n(adding the first two terms and then adding their sum to the third \nterm)\n– 7\n 10\n+\n– 11\n+\n(adding the last two terms and then adding their sum to the first \nterm)\nWhat do you see? The sums are the same in both cases.\nAgain, we know that while adding positive numbers, grouping them \nin any of the above two ways gives the same sum. \nWill this also hold when there are terms having negative numbers as \nwell? Take some more expressions and check. \nCan you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of \nintegers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? \nThus, grouping the terms of an expression in either of the following \nways gives the same value.\nTerm 1\nTerm 2\nTerm 1\nTerm 3\nTerm 2\n+\nTerm 3\n+\n+\n=\n+\nLet us consider the expression (–7) + 10 + (–11) again. What happens \nwhen we change the order and add –7 and –11 first, and then add this \nsum to 10? Will we get the same sum as before?\nWe see that adding the terms of the expression (–7) + 10 + (–11) in \nany order gives the same sum of –8.\nTry\nThis\nTry\nThis\nArithmetic Expressions\nDoes adding the terms of an expression in any order give the same \nvalue? Take some more expressions and check. Consider expressions \nwith more than 3 terms also. \nCan you explain why this is happening using the Token Model of \nintegers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? \nThus, the addition of terms in any order gives the same value.\nTherefore, in an expression having only additions, it does not matter \nin what order the terms are added: they all give the same value.\nNow let us consider expressions having multiplication and division \nalso, without the order of operations specified by the brackets. The \nvalues of such expressions are found by first evaluating the terms. \nOnce all the terms are evaluated, they are added. \nFor example, the expression 30 + 5 × 4 is evaluated as follows:\n30\n5 × 4\n+\n+\n30 + 5 × 4 =\n=\n=\nThe expression 5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 is evaluated as follows:\n5 × (3 + 2)\n+\n5 × (3 + 2) + 78 + 3 =\n+\n7 × 8\nWhere (3+2) is first evaluated and this sum is multiplied by 5 (= 25). \nThe expression 7 × 8 is evaluated (= 56). This simplifies to 25 + 56 + 3 = \n84.\nManasa is adding a long list of numbers. It took her five \nminutes to add them all and she got the answer 11749. Then \nshe realised that she had forgotten to include the fourth \nnumber 9055.

Notice, that we did not do \n200 – 40 + 3.\nSo,\n200 – (40 + 3) = 200 – 40 – 3.\nExample 12: We also saw this earlier in the case of Irfan purchasing a \nbiscuit packet (₹15) and a toor dal packet (₹56). When he paid ₹100, the \nchange he gets in rupees is: \n100 – (15 + 56) = 29.\nThe change could also have been calculated as follows: \n(a)\t First subtract the cost of the biscuit packet (15) from 100: \n100 – 15 = 85.\n\t\nThis is the amount the shopkeeper owes Irfan if he had \npurchased only the biscuits. As he has purchased toor dal \nalso, its cost is taken from this remaining amount of 85. \n(b)\t So, to find the change, we need to subtract the cost of toor \ndal from 85.\n85 – 56 = 29.\n\t\nWhat we have done here is 100 – 15 – 56. So,\n100 – (15 + 56) = 100 – 15 – 56.\nNotice how upon removing the brackets preceded by a negative \nsign, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change.

Is it possible to \nwrite this expression without the brackets?\nTo evaluate this expression, we need to subtract 250 – 100 = 150 \nfrom 500:\n500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 150 = 350.\nIf we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have \nsubtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back \nthat 100 to 500 – 250 to make the expression take the same value as 500 \n– (250 – 100). This sequence of operations is 500 – 250+100. Thus,\n500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 250 + 100.\nCheck that 500 – (250 – 100) is not equal to 500 – 250 – 100.\nNotice again that when the brackets preceded by a negative sign \nare removed,  the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. In this \ncase, the signs of 250 and – 100 change to – 250 and 100.\nExample 14: Hira has a rare coin collection. She has 28 coins in one bag \nand 35 coins in another.

Since the terms \ncan be added in any order, this expression can simply be written as \n28 + 35 + (–10), or 28 + 35 – 10.

Can it be described by \nthe expression: 2 × 43 + 24? \nMath \nTalk\nArithmetic Expressions\nWriting it as sum of terms gives:\n2 × 43 \n+\nThis expression means 24 more than \n2 × 43. But, we want an expression \nwhich means twice or double of 43 + 24.\nWe can make use of brackets to write \nsuch an expression: \n2 × (43 + 24).\nSo, we can say that together they have \nto pay 2 × (43 + 24). This is also the same \nas paying for two vegetable cutlets and \ntwo rasgullas: \n2 × 43 + 2 × 24.\nTherefore, \n2 × (43 + 24) = 2 × 43 + 2 × 24.\nIf another friend, Sangmu, joins them and orders the same items, what \nwill be the expression for the total amount to be paid?\nExample 16: In the Republic Day parade, there are boy scouts and girl \nguides marching together. The scouts march in 4 rows with 5 scouts in \neach row. The guides march in 3 rows with 5 guides in each row (see \nthe figure below). How many scouts and guides are marching in this \nparade?\nThe number of boy scouts marching is 4 × 5. The number of girl \nguides marching is 3 × 5.\nThe total number of \nscouts and guides will be \n4 × 5 + 3 × 5.\nThis can also be found \nby first finding the total \nnumber of rows, i.e., 4 + \n3, and then multiplying \ntheir sum by the number \nof children in each row. \nThus, the number of boys \nand girls can be found by \n(4 + 3) × 5. \nTherefore, 4 × 5 + 3 × 5 \n= (4 + 3) × 5.\nComputing these expressions, we get\n4 × 5\n3 × 5\n+\n+\n4 × 5 + 3 × 5 =\n=\n=\n \n2 × 43 + 2 × 24\n2 × (43 + 24)\n₹ 43\n₹ 43\n₹ 24\n₹ 24\n3 × 5\n(4+3) × 5\n4 × 5\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\n(4 + 3) × 5 = 7 × 5 = 35\n5 × 4 + 3 ≠ 5 × (4 + 3).

Thus, \n10 × 98 +3 × 98 = (10 + 3) × 98.\nWriting this equality the other way, we get\n(10 + 3) 98 = 10 × 98 + 3 × 98.\nSwapping the numbers in the products above, this property can be \nseen in the following form:\n98 × 10 + 9 × 83 = 98 (10 + 3), and\n98 (10 + 3) = 98 × 10 + 98 × 3.\nSimilarly, let us consider the expression 14 × 10 – 6 × 10. This means \nsubtracting 6 times 10 from 14 times 10.\n10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10\n14 times\nClearly, this is 14 – 6 = 8 times 10.

The example below \ncompares how the same length is \nrepresented when the unit is split \ninto 10 equal parts and when the \nunit is split into 4 equal parts.\nIf an even more precise measure \nis needed, each quarter can further \nbe split into four equal parts. Each \npart then measures 1\n16 of a unit, i.e., \n16 such parts make 1 unit.\nThen why split a unit into 10 parts every time?\nThe reason is the special role that 10 plays in the Indian place value \nsystem. For a whole number written in the Indian place value system — \nfor example, 281 — the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is \ntens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger \nthan the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is \n10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left:\n10 ones make 1 ten,\n10 tens make 1 hundred,\n10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on.\n10,000\n100\n1\n× 10\n÷ 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\nIn order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities \nsmaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts. What does \nthis give? It gives one-tenth. Further dividing it into 10 parts gives \none-hundredth, and so on.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nCan we extend this further?\nWhat will the fraction be when 1\n100 is split into 10 equal parts?\nIt will be \n1000 , i.e., a thousand such parts make up a unit.\nJust as when we extend to the left of 10,000, we get bigger place \nvalues at each step, we can also extend to the right of \n1000 , getting \nsmaller place values at each step.\n10,000\n100\n1\n10\n100\n× 10\n÷ 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\nA Peek Beyond the Point\nThis way of writing numbers is called the “decimal system” since it \nis based on the number 10; “decem” means ten in Latin, which in turn \nis cognate to the Sanskrit daśha meaning 10, with similar words for \n10 occurring across many Indian languages including Odia, Konkani, \nMarathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Bodo, and Assamese. We shall learn \nabout other ways of writing numbers in later grades.\nHow Big?\nWe already know that a hundred 10s make 1000, and a hundred 100s \nmake 10000.\nWe can ask similar questions about fractional parts:\n(a)\t \tHow many thousandths make one unit?\n(b)\t \tHow many thousandths make one tenth?\n(c)\t \tHow many thousandths make one hundredth?\n(d)\t \tHow many tenths make one ten?\n(e)\t \tHow many hundredths make one ten?\nMake a few more questions of this kind and answer them.\nNotation, Writing and Reading of Numbers\nWe have been writing numbers in a particular way, say 456, instead of \nwriting them as 4 × 100 (4 hundreds) + 5 × 10 (5 tens) + 6 × 1 (6 ones). \nSimilarly, can we skip writing tenths and hundredths?\nCan the quantity 4 2\n10 be written as 42 (skipping the 1\n10 in 2 × 1\n10) ? \nIf yes, how would we know if 42 means 4 tens and 2 units or it \nmeans 4 units and 2 tenths?\nSimilarly, 705 could mean:\n(a)\t \t7 hundreds, and 0 tens and 5 ones (700 + 0 + 5)\n(b)\t \t7 tens and 0 units and 5 tenths (70 + 0 + 5\n10)\n(c)\t \t7 units and 0 tenths and 5 hundredths (7 + 0\n10 + 5\n100)\n1,00,000\n10,000\n100\n1\n10\n100\n1000 \n10,000 \n× 10\n× 10\n× 10\n× 10\n× 10\n× 10\n× 10\n× 10\n× 10\n÷ 10\n÷ 10\n÷ 10\n÷ 10\n÷ 10\n÷ 10\n÷ 10\n÷ 10\n÷ 10\nMath \nTalk\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nSince these are different quantities, we need to have distinct ways \nof writing them.\nTo identify the place value where integers end and the fractional \nparts start, we use a point or period (‘.’) as a separator, called a \ndecimal point.\nThe above quantities in decimal notation are then:\nQuantity\nDecimal Notation\n7 hundreds and 5 ones \n(700 + 0 + 5)\n7 tens and 5 tenths (70 + 0 + 5\n10)\n70.5\n7 units and 5 hundredths \n(7 + 0 + 5\n100)\n7.05\nThese numbers, when shown through place value, are as follows:\nDecimal \nnumber\nHundreds\nTens\nUnits\nTenths\nHundredths\n7 × 100\n0 × 10\n5 × 1\n70.5\n7 × 10\n0 × 1\n5 × 1\n7.05\n7 × 1\n0 × 1\n5 × 1\n× 10\t × 1 \t\n×  1\n10\t ×  1\nnumber of \ntens\nnumber of \nunits\nnumber of \none-tents\nnumber of one-hundredths\nA Peek Beyond the Point\nThus decimal notation is a natural extension of the Indian place \nvalue system to numbers also having fractional parts. Just as 705 means \n7 × 100 + 5 × 1, the number 70.5 means 7 × 10 + 5 × 1\n10 , and 7.05 means \n7 × 1 +5 × 1\n100. \nWe have seen how to write numbers using the decimal point (‘.’).

(1 euro-cent = 1/100 \neuro).\n•\t In 1983, a decimal error nearly caused a disaster for an Air Canada \nBoeing 767. The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300 \npounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1 \npound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the \npilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield. \nFortunately, everyone survived.\nSeveral incidents have occurred due to incorrect reading of decimal \nnumbers while giving medication. For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5 \nmg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed \nquantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the \nlocation of the decimal point.\nDeceptive Decimal Notation\nSarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post \nnoon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.? \nNone of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10 \nequal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60 \nminutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach \nthe station at 4:30.\nHere is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width \nof an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a \ndoor 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches \n(since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully.\nI said the door’s \nwidth should be \n2.5 ft.\nIt is 2.5 ft! You \ncan verify.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nIf you watch cricket, you might have noticed decimal-looking \nnumbers like ‘Overs left: 5.5’. Does this mean 5 overs and 5 balls or 5 \novers and 3 balls? Here, 5.5 overs means 5 5\n6 overs (as 1 over = 6 balls), \ni.e., 5 overs and 5 balls.\nWhere else can we see such ‘non-decimals’ with a decimal-like \nnotation? \nA Pinch of History – Decimal Notation Over Time\nDecimal fractions (i.e., fractions with denominators like 1\n10 , \n100 , \n1000 , and so on) are used in the works of a number of ancient Indian \nastronomers and mathematicians, including in the important 8th \ncentury works of Śhrīdharāchārya on arithmetic and algebra. Decimal \nnotation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in \nKitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al Hindī (The Book of Chapters on Indian \nArithmetic) by Abūl Ḥassan al-Uqlīdisī, an Arab mathematician, in \naround 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0ˈ 059375.\nIn the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional \nparts, a number of different notations were used:\n•\t a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as \nshown above),\n•\t use of different colours and\n•\t a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal \nplaces (0.36 would be written as 36\n).\nIn the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and \nChristopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period \n(‘.’) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while \nFrançois Viète, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead. \nCurrently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer \npart and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5 \nis written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator). But the decimal \npoint has endured as the most popular notation for writing numbers \nhaving fractional parts in the Indian place value system.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t \tConvert the following fractions into decimals:\n(a)\t\n100\n(b)\t\n1000\n(c)\t\n10\n(d)\t\n1000\nMath \nTalk\nA Peek Beyond the Point\n2.\t \tConvert the following decimals into a sum of tenths, hundredths \nand thousandths:\n(a)\t 0.34\n(b)\t 1.02\n(c)\t\n0.8\n(d)\t 0.362\n3.\t \tWhat decimal number does each letter represent in the number \nline below?\nb\na\nc\n6.6\n6.5\n6.4\n4.\t \tArrange the following quantities in descending order:\n(a)\t 11.01, 1.011, 1.101, 11.10, 1.01\n(b)\t 2.567, 2.675, 2.768, 2.499, 2.698\n(c)\t 4.678 g, 4.595 g, 4.600 g, 4.656 g, 4.666 g\n(d)\t 33.13 m, 33.31 m, 33.133 m, 33.331 m, 33.313 m\n5.\t \tUsing the digits 1, 4, 0, 8, and 6 make:\n(a)\t the decimal number closest to 30\n(b)\t the smallest possible decimal number between 100 and 1000.\n6.\t \tWill a decimal number with more digits be greater than a decimal \nnumber with fewer digits? \n7.\t \tMahi purchases 0.25 kg of beans, 0.3 kg of carrots, 0.5 kg of potatoes, \n0.2 kg of capsicums, and 0.05 kg of ginger.

When Aftab’s age \n10 years, Shabnam’s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab’s age is 18 years, \nwhat will Shabnam’s age be? _______ \nGiven Aftab’s age, how will you find out Shabnam’s age?\nEasy: We add 3 to Aftab’s age to get Shabnam’s age.\nCan we write this as an expression? \nShabnam’s age is 3 years more than Aftab’s. In short, this can be \nwritten as:\nShabnam’s age = Aftab’s age + 3.\nSuch \nmathematical \nrelations \nare \ngenerally represented in a shorthand \nform. In the relation above, instead \nof writing the phrase ‘Aftab’s Age’, \nthe convention is to use a convenient \nsymbol. Usually, letters or short phrases \nare used for this purpose.\nLet us say we use the letter a to \ndenote Aftab’s age (we could have \nused any other letter), and s to denote \nShabnam’s age. Then the expression to \nfind Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as\ns = a + 3.\nIf a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age?\nExpression for \nShabnam’s age\n4 + 3\n10 + 3\n23 + 3\n? + 3\na + 3\nAftab’s \nage \n10\n?\na\nFig. 4.1\nEXPRESSIONS \nUSING LETTER-\nNUMBERS\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nReplacing a by 23 in the expression a + 3, we get, s = 23 + 3 = 26 years.\nLetters such as a and s that are used to represent numbers are called \nletter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers, \nsuch as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions.\nGiven the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab’s age.\nWe know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab’s \nage will be 3 less than Shabnam’s. This can be described as\n\t\n\t\nAftab’s age = Shabnam’s age – 3.\nIf we again use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age and the letter s \nto denote Shabnam’s age, then the algebraic expression would be: \na = s – 3, meaning 3 less than s.\nUse this expression to find Aftab’s age if Shabnam’s age is 20.\nExample 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns.

It will be 45 × 2.\n\u0007Now, what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number \nof sticks?\nFirst, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L \nneeds 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2 \ntimes the number of L’s. This can be written as:\nNumber of matchsticks = 2 × Number of L’s\nNow, we can use any letter to denote the number of L’s. Let’s use n. \nThe algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be:\n2 × n.\nThis expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make \nn L’s. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the \nnumber of L.\nExample 3: Ketaki prepares and supplies coconut-jaggery laddus.

Many times they could have \nbeen read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping \n(adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers \nby grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating \nexpressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of \nthe expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including \nbrackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive \nproperty (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples).\nLet us revise these concepts and find the values of the following \nexpressions:\n1.\t\n23 – 10 × 2\t\n2. \t\n83 + 28 – 13 + 32\n3.\t\n34 – 14 + 20\t\n4. \t\n42 + 15 – (8 – 7)\n5.\t\n68 – (18 + 13)\t\n6. \t\n7 × 4 + 9 × 6\n7.\t\n20 + 8 × (16 – 6)\nLet us evaluate the first expression, 23 – 10 × 2. First we shall write \nthe terms of the expression. Notice that one of the terms is a number, \nwhile the other one has to be converted to a number before adding the \ntwo terms. \n23 – 10 × 2 = 23 + –10 × 2 = 23 + –20 = 3\nw – 1\nw\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nLet us now evaluate the second one. All the terms of this expression \nare numbers. If we notice the terms, we find that it will be easier to \nevaluate if we swap and group the terms. \n83 + 28 – 13 + 32 = \nLet us now look at the fifth expression. It has brackets with a negative \nsign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways — by solving the bracket \nfirst (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets \nappropriately (as on the right side).\nNow, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions. \nAlgebraic expressions also take number values when the letter-\nnumbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for \nfinding Shabnam’s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the \nletter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26.\n4.3 \u0007Omission of the Multiplication Symbol in \nAlgebraic Expressions\nLook at this number sequence:\n4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...\nHow can we describe this sequence or pattern?

Let us now find an expression to find the \nperimeter of a rectangle. \nIf a = – 4,\nthen 10 – a = 6.\nIf d = 6,\nthen 3d = 36.\nIf s = 7,\nthen 3s – 2 = 15.\nIf r = 8,\nthen 2r + 1 = 29.\nIf j = 5,\nthen 2j = 10.\nIf m = –6,\nthen 3 (m + 1) = 19.\nIf f = 3, g = 1\nthen 2f – 2g = 2.\nIf t = 4, b = 3\nthen 2t + b = 24.\nIf h = 5, n = 6\nthen h – (3 – n) = 4.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nAs in the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter \nwhen the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known: \nFind the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth.\nLet us use the letter-numbers l and b in place of length and breadth \nrespectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have \np = l + b + l + b\nAs we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an \nexpression can be added in any order. Hence the above expression can \nbe written as:\n= l + l + b + b\nAs l + l = 2 × l = 2l, and b + b = 2 × b = 2b, we have \np = 2l + 2b.\nNotice that the initial expression (l + b + l + b) and the final expression \n(2l + 2b) that we got for the perimeter look different. However, they \nare equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by \napplying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are \nequal in the sense that they both take the same values when letter-\nnumbers are replaced by numbers. \nFor example, if we assign l = 3, b = 4, we get\nl + b + l + b = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14, and\n2l + 2b = 2 × 3 + 2 × 4 = 14.\nWe call the expression 2l + 2b the simplified form of l + b + l + b.\nLet us see some more examples of simplification.\nExample 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers \nsold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d. Find \nthe total money earned by the shopkeeper during these three days.\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\nPencils \n(Price ‘c’)\n3\nErasers \n(Price ‘d’)\n6\nLet us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils.\nThe money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c. Similarly, the \nmoney earned by selling pencils on Day 2 is _____, and Day 3 is ______.\nThe total money earned by the sale of pencils is 5c + 3c + 10c. Can we \nsimplify this expression further and reduce the number of terms?\nExpressions Using Letter-Numbers \nThe expression means 5 times c is added to 3 times c is added to 10 \ntimes c. So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This \nis what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus,\n5 × c + 3 × c + 10 × c = (5 + 3 + 10) × c\n(5 + 3 + 10) × c can be simplified to 18 × c = 18c. \nIf c = ₹50, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils.\nWrite the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers. \nThen, simplify the expression.\nThe expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and \nerasers during these three days is 18c + 11d.\nCan the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further?\nThere is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains \ndifferent letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form.\nIn this problem, we saw the expression 5c + 3c + 10c getting simplified \nto the expression 18c. \nCheck that both expressions take the same value when c is replaced by \ndifferent numbers. \nExample 6: A big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as \nshown. Write an expression describing the area of the bigger rectangle.\nThe areas of the smaller rectangles are 4v sq. units and 3v sq. units. \nThe area of the bigger rectangle can be found in two ways: (i) by \ndirectly using its side lengths v and (4 + 3), or (ii) by adding the areas \nof the smaller rectangles.\nThe first way gives 7v, and the second way gives 4v + 3v. We know \nthat they are equal: 4v + 3v = 7v, and this is the required expression for \nthe area of the bigger rectangle.\nAs earlier, a big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown \nbelow. Write an expression to find the area of the rectangle AEFD. \nAnother way of seeing \nthe distributive \nproperty.\n4\nv\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nEven in this case, the area of rectangle AEFD can be found in two \nways: (i) by directly using the side lengths n and (12 – 4), or (ii) \nsubtracting the area of the rectangle EBCF from that of ABCD.\nThe first method gives us 8n, and the second method gives us \n12n – 4n, and they are equal, since 12n – 4n = 8n. This is the expression \nfor the area of the rectangle AEFD.\nSets of terms such as (5c, c, 10c), (12n, – 4n) that involve the same \nletter-numbers are called like terms. Sets of terms such as {18c, 11d} \nare called unlike terms as they have different letter-numbers.\nAs we have seen, like terms can be added together and simplified \ninto a single term.\nExample 7: A shop rents out chairs \nand tables for a day’s use.

It appears for the first time at position 3, \nthe second time at position 6. \nWhere would design C appear for the nth time?\nWe can see that this design appears in positions that are multiples of \n3. So the nth occurrence of Design C will be at position 3n.\nSimilarly, find the formula that gives the position where the other \nDesigns appear for the nth time.\nThe positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on.\nWe can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one \nless than the position at which Design C appears for the nth time. Thus, \nthe nth occurrence of Design B is at position:\n3n – 1\nSimilarly, the expression describing the position at which the design \nA appears for the nth time is: 3n – 2.\nGiven a position number can we find out the design that appears there? \nWhich Design appears at Position 122?\nIf the position is a multiple of 3, then clearly we have Design C. As \nseen earlier, if the position is one less than a multiple of 3, it has Design \nB, and if it is 2 less than a multiple of 3, then it has Design A. \nCan the remainder obtained by dividing the position number by 3 be \nused for this?

Consider 2 × 2 squares, \nas marked in the calendar. The numbers in this square show an \ninteresting property.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nLet us take the marked 2 × 2 square, and \nconsider the numbers lying on the diagonals; \n12 and 20; 13 and 19. Find their sums; 12 + 20, \n13 + 19. What do you observe?\nThey are equal. \nLet us extend the numbers in the calendar beyond \n30, creating endless rows.\nWill the diagonal sums be equal in every 2 × 2 square in this endless \ngrid? How can we be sure? \nTo be sure of this we cannot check with all 2 × 2 squares as there are \nan unlimited number of them.\nLet us consider a 2 × 2 square. Its top left number can be any number. \nLet us call it ‘a’. \nGiven that we know the top left number, how do we \nfind the other numbers in this 2 × 2 square?\nAs we have been doing, first let us describe the other \nnumbers in words. \na\n?\n?\n?\n13\n20\nExpressions Using Letter-Numbers \n•\t the number to the right of ‘a’ will be 1 more than it.\n•\t the number below ‘a’ will be 7 more than it.\n•\t the number diagonal to ‘a’ will be 8 more than it.\nSo the other numbers in the 2 × 2 square can be \nrepresented as shown in the grid. Let us find the \ndiagonal sums; a + (a + 8), and (a + 1) + (a + 7).\nLet us simplify them.\nSince the terms can be added in any order, the \nbrackets can be opened.\na + (a + 8) = a + a + 8 = 2a + 8\n(a + 1) + (a + 7) = a + 1 + a + 7 = a + a + 1 + 7 = 2a + 8\nWe see that both diagonal sums are equal to 2a + 8 (8 more than \n2 times a).\nVerify this expression for diagonal sums by considering any 2 × 2 \nsquare and taking its top left number to be ‘a’. \nThus, we have shown that diagonal sums are equal for any value of \na, i.e., for any 2 × 2 square!\n \nConsider a set of numbers from the calendar (having endless rows) \nforming under the following shape:\nFind the sum of all the numbers. Compare it with the number in the \ncentre: 15. Repeat this for another set of numbers that forms this shape. \nWhat do you observe? \nWe see that the total sum is always 5 times the number in the centre.\nWill this always happen?

Similarly, find the number of matchsticks needed for Step 84 \nand Step 108.\n2\n4\nExpressions Using Letter-Numbers \nWhat could be an expression describing the rule/formula to find out \nthe number of matchsticks at any step?\nThe pattern is such that in Step 10, nine 2s and an added 3 (3 + 2 × \n9) gives the number of matchsticks; in Step 11, ten 2s and an added \n3 (3 + 2 × 10) gives the number of matchsticks. For step y, what is \nthe expression?\nIt is: one less than y (i.e. y – 1) 2s and a 3.\nTherefore, the expression is\n3 + 2 × (y – 1).\nThis expression gives the number of matchsticks in Step y. Now we \ncan find the number of matchsticks at any step quickly.\nYou might have already noticed that there is a 2 in the first step also, \n3 = 1 + 2. Using this, the expression we get is \n2y + 1.\nDoes the above expression also give the number of matchsticks at each \nstep correctly? Are these expressions the same?\nWe can check by simplifying the expression 3 + 2 × (y – 1).\n3 + 2 × (y – 1) = 3 + 2y – 2\n= 2y + 1.\nBoth expressions are the same.\nThere is a different way to count, or see the pattern. Let us take a \nlook at the picture again.\nMatchsticks are placed in two orientations — (a) horizontal ones at \nthe top and bottom, and (b) the ones placed diagonally in the middle. \nFor example, in step 2 there are 2 matchsticks placed horizontally and \n3 matchsticks placed diagonally. \nWhat are these numbers in Step 3 and Step 4?\nHow does the number of matchsticks change in each orientation as the \nsteps increase?

Now, on \nthe creases formed by the folds, draw lines using a pencil and a scale. \nYou will notice different lines on the paper. Take any pair of lines and \nobserve their relationship with each other. Do they meet? If they do \nnot meet within the paper, do you think they would meet if they were \nextended beyond the paper?\nFig. 5.1\nIn this chapter, we will explore the relationship between lines on a \nplane surface. The table top, your piece of paper, the blackboard, and \nthe bulletin board are all examples of plane surfaces.\nLet us observe a pair of lines that meet each other. You will notice \nthat they meet at a point. When a pair of lines meet each other at a \npoint on a plane surface, we say that the lines intersect each other.\nLet us observe what happens when two lines intersect.\nHow many angles do they form? \nIn Fig. 5.2, where line l intersects line m, we can see that four angles \nare formed.\nParallel and Intersecting Lines\nm\na\nb\nl\nc\nd\nFig. 5.2\nCan two straight lines intersect at more than one point?\nActivity 1\nDraw two lines on a plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure \nthe four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of \nintersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of \nintersection.\nWhat patterns do you observe among these angles?\nIn Fig. 5.2, if ∠a is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of ∠b, ∠c \nand ∠d, without drawing and measuring them?\nWe know that ∠a and ∠b together measure 180°, because when they \nare combined, they form a straight angle which measures 180°. So, if \n∠a is 120°, then ∠b must be 60°.\nSimilarly, ∠b and ∠c together measure 180°. So, if ∠b is 60°, then ∠c \nmust be 120°. And ∠c and ∠d together measure 180°. So, if ∠c is 120°, \nthen ∠d must be 60°.\nTherefore, in Fig. 5.2, ∠a and ∠c measure 120°, and ∠b and ∠d \nmeasure 60°.\nWhen two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled \na, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then ∠a and ∠c are equal, and ∠b and ∠d \nare equal!\nIs this always true for any pair of intersecting lines?\nCheck this for different measures of ∠a. Using these measurements, \ncan you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of ∠a?\nWe can generalise our reasoning for Fig. 5.2, without assuming the \nvalues of ∠a.\n\u0007Since straight angles measure 180°, we must have ∠a + ∠b = ∠a + ∠d \n= 180°. Hence, ∠b and ∠d are always equal. Similarly, ∠b + ∠a = ∠b + \n∠c = 180°, so ∠a and ∠c must be equal.  \nAdjacent angles, like ∠a and ∠b, formed by two lines intersecting \neach other, are called linear pairs. Linear pairs always add up to 180°.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nOpposite angles, like ∠b and ∠d, formed by two lines intersecting \neach other, are called vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite \nangles are always equal to each other.\nFrom the above reasoning, we conclude that whenever two lines \nintersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. Such a justification is \ncalled a proof in mathematics.\nFigure it Out\nList all the linear pairs and vertically opposite angles you \nobserve in Fig. 5.3:\nLinear Pairs\n∠a and ∠b, …\nPairs of Vertically \nOpposite Angles\n∠b and ∠d, …\nMeasurements and Geometry\nYou might have noticed that when you measure linear pairs, sometimes \nthey may not add up to 180°. Or, when you measure vertically opposite \nangles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this?\nThere could be different reasons:\n•\t Measurement errors because of improper use of measuring \ninstruments — in this case, a protractor\n•\t Variation in the thickness of the lines drawn. The “ideal” line in \ngeometry does not have any thickness! But it is not possible for us \nto draw lines without any thickness\nIn geometry, we create ideal versions of “lines” and other shapes \nwe see around us, and analyse the relationships between them. For \nexample, we know that the angle formed by a straight line is 180°. \nSo, if another line divides this angle into two parts, both parts should \nadd up to 180°. We arrive at this simply through reasoning and not \nby measurement. When we measure, it might not be exactly so, for \nthe reasons mentioned above. Still the measurements come out very \nclose to what we predict, because of which geometry finds widespread \napplication in different disciplines such as physics, art, engineering \nand architecture.\n5.2 Perpendicular Lines\nCan you draw a pair of intersecting lines such that all four angles are \nequal? Can you figure out what will be the measure of each angle?\nc\nb\na\nd\nl\nm\nFig. 5.3\nParallel and Intersecting Lines\nm\nl\nFig. 5.4\nIf two lines intersect and all four angles are equal, then each angle \nmust be a right angle (90°).\nPerpendicular lines are a pair of lines which intersect each other \nat right angles (90°). In Fig. 5.4, we can say that lines l and m are \nperpendicular to each other.\n5.3 Between Lines\nObserve Fig. 5.5 and describe the way the line segments meet or cross \neach other in each case, with appropriate mathematical words (a point, \nan endpoint, the midpoint, meet, intersect) and the degree measure of \neach angle.\nFor example, line segments FG and FH meet at the endpoint F at an \nangle 115.3°.\nS\nT\nV\nU\nC\nA\nB\nD\nX\nH\nM\nJ\nY\nI\nL\nR\nP\nO\nQ\nF\nG\n115.3°\nFig. 5.5\nAre line segments ST and UV likely to meet if they are extended?\nAre line segments OP and QR likely to meet if they are extended?\nHere are some examples of lines we notice around us.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nWhat is common to the lines in the pictures above? They do not seem \nlikely to intersect each other. Such lines are called parallel lines.\nParallel lines are a pair of lines that lie on the same plane, and do \nnot meet however far we extend them at both ends.\nName some parallel lines you can spot in your classroom.\nParallel lines are often used in artwork and shading.\nWhich pairs of lines appear to be parallel in Fig. 5.6 below?\na\nc\nd\ne\ng\nf\nh\ni\nb\nFig. 5.6\nNote to the Teacher: It is important that the lines lie on the same plane.

How \ndo you decide this?\nNote to the Teacher: It is easier to draw vertical and horizontal lines and the \nones inclined at 45° (on rectangular dot sheets), but drawing a line parallel to \none which has a different orientation is slightly harder. Let students use their \nintuition for this.\nFrom previous exercises we observed that sometimes it is difficult \nto be sure whether two lines are parallel. To determine this we use the \nidea of transversals.\na\nc\nb\nFig. 5.13\nParallel and Intersecting Lines\n5.5 Transversals\nWe saw what happens when two lines intersect in different ways. Let \nus explore what happens when one line intersects two different lines.\nl\n4\n8\n3\n7\nt\nm\nFig. 5.14\nIn Fig. 5.14, line t intersects lines l and m. t is called a transversal. \nNotice that 8 angles are formed when a line crosses a pair of lines.\nIs it possible for all the eight angles to have different measurements? \nWhy, why not?\nWhat about five different angles — 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2?\nIn Fig. 5.14, since ∠1 and ∠3 are vertically opposite angles,  they are \nequal. Are there other pairs of vertically opposite angles? We can see \nthat there are a total of four pairs of vertically opposite angles and in \neach pair, the angles are equal to each other.\nThus, when a transversal intersects two lines, it forms eight angles \nwith a maximum of four distinct angle measures.\n5.6 Corresponding Angles\nIn Fig. 5.14, we notice that the transversal t forms two sets of angles — \none with line l and another with line m. There are angles in the first set \nthat  correspond to angles in the second set based on their position. ∠1 \nand ∠5 are called corresponding angles. Similarly, ∠2 and ∠6, ∠3 and \n∠7, ∠4 and ∠8 are the corresponding angles formed when transversal \nt intersects lines l and m.\nActivity 3\nDraw a pair of lines and a transversal such that they form two \ndistinct angles.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nStep 1: Draw a line l and a transversal t intersecting it at point X.\nFig. 5.15\nX\nl\nt\n \nStep 2: Measure ∠a formed by lines l and t (let us say it is 60°).\n \na = 60°\nl\nX\nt\nFig. 5.16\nHow many distinct angles have formed now?\nIf one angle is 60°, the other angle of the linear pair should be 120°. \nSo, we already have two distinct angles.\nSo, when we draw another line intersecting the transversal t we \nwish to form only two angles, 60° and 120°. \nStep 3: Mark a point Y on line t.\na = 60°\nl\nX\nt\nY\nFig. 5.17\nStep 4: Draw a line m through point Y that forms a 60° angle to line t. \nThis can be done either by copying ∠a with a tracing paper or you can \nuse a protractor to measure the angles.\n \na = 60°\nb = 60°\nl\nm\nX\nt\nY\nFig. 5.18\nWhat do you observe about lines l and m? Do they appear to be \nparallel to each other?\nYes, they do appear to be parallel to each other.\nAngles, ∠a and ∠b are corresponding angles formed by the transversal \nt on lines l and m. These corresponding angles are equal to each other.\nParallel and Intersecting Lines\nFrom this we can observe:\nWhen the corresponding angles formed by a transversal on a pair \nof lines are equal to each other, then the pair of lines are parallel \nto each other.\nSuppose, we have a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. What \ncan be said about the corresponding angles?\nActivity 4\nFig. 5.19 has a pair of parallel lines l and m (what is the notation used \nin the figure to indicate they are parallel?) . Line t is the transversal \nacross these two lines. ∠a and ∠b are corresponding angles. Take a \ntracing paper and trace ∠a on it. Now place this tracing paper over \n∠b and see if the angles align exactly. You will observe that the angles \nmatch. Check the other corresponding angles in the figure using a \nprotractor. Are all the corresponding angles equal to each other?\nl\na\nb\nm\nt\nFig. 5.19\nCorresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair \nof parallel lines are always equal to each other.\nActivity 5\nIn Fig. 5.20, draw a transversal t to the lines l and m such that one pair \nof corresponding angles is equal. You can measure the angles with a \nprotractor.\nl\nm\nFig. 5.20\nAre you finding it hard to draw a transversal such that the \ncorresponding angles are equal?\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nWhen a pair of lines are not parallel to each other, the corresponding \nangles formed by a transversal can never be equal to each other.\n5.7 Drawing Parallel Lines\nCan you draw a pair of parallel lines using a ruler and a set square?\nFig. 5.21 shows how you can do it.\nDraw a line l with a scale. By sliding your set square you can make \ntwo lines perpendicular to line l.\nAre these two lines parallel to each other? How are we sure that they \nare parallel to each other? What angles are formed between these lines \nand line l?\nl\nFig. 5.21\nSince we used a set square, the angles measure 90°. The position \nof the lines is different, but they make the same angle with l. If line l \nis seen as a transversal to the two new lines, then the corresponding \nangles measure 90°.\nFig. 5.22\nl\nAs we know these are corresponding angles and they are equal, we \ncan be sure that the lines are parallel.\nDraw two more parallel lines using the long side of the set square as \nshown in Fig. 5.22.\nParallel and Intersecting Lines\nHow do you know these two lines are parallel? Can you check if the \ncorresponding angles are equal?\nNote to the Teacher: Students should be encouraged to check the equality of \ncorresponding angles both by using the tracing method and using protractors to \nmeasure the angles. Pay attention to the language used to make the relationship \nbetween corresponding angles and parallel lines. Equality of corresponding \nangles is both necessary and sufficient for the pair of lines to be parallel to \neach other.\nFigure it Out\nCan you draw a line parallel to l, that goes through point A? How will \nyou do it with the tools from your geometry box? Describe your method.\nFig. 5.23\nA\nl\nMaking Parallel Lines through Paper Folding\nLet us try to do the same with paper folding. For a line l (given as a \ncrease), how do we make a line parallel to l such that it passes through \npoint A?\nWe know how to fold a piece of paper to get a line perpendicular to l. \nNow, try to fold a perpendicular to l such that it passes through point \nA. Let us call this new crease t.\nNow, fold a line perpendicular to t passing through A again. Let us \ncall this line m. The lines l and m are parallel to each other.\nFig. 5.24\nl\nl\nA\nt\nl\nA\nl\nm\nA\nt\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nWhy are lines l and m parallel to each other?\n5.8 Alternate Angles\nIn Fig. 5.25, ∠d is called the alternate angle of ∠f, and ∠c is the alternate \nangle of ∠e. \na\nb\nd\nc\ne\nh\ng\nm\nl\nt\nf\nFig. 5.25\nYou can find the alternate angle of a given angle, say ∠f, by first \nfinding the corresponding angle of ∠f, which is ∠b and then finding the \nvertically opposite angle of ∠b, which is ∠d.\nActivity 6\nIn Fig. 5.25, if ∠f is 120° what is the measure of its alternate angle ∠d?\nWe can find the measure of ∠d if we know ∠b because they are \nvertically opposite angles. Remember, vertically opposite angles are \nequal.\nWhat is the measure of ∠b? It is 120° because it is the corresponding \nangle of ∠f.\nSo, ∠d also measures 120°.\nIn fact, ∠f = ∠b irrespective of the measure of ∠f. Why? Because ∠b \nis the corresponding angle of ∠f.\nSimilarly, ∠b = ∠d irrespective of the measure of ∠b. Why? Because \n∠d is the vertically opposite angle of ∠b. So, it must always be the \ncase that\n∠f = ∠d\nUsing our understanding of corresponding angles without any \nmeasurements, we have justified that alternate angles are always equal.\nAlternate angles formed by a transversal intersecting a pair of \nparallel lines are always equal to each other.\nExample 1: In Fig. 5.26, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the \ntransversal t. If ∠6 is 135°, what are the measures of the other angles? \nParallel and Intersecting Lines\nl\nt\nm\n3\n5\n135°\n8\nFig. 5.26\nSolution: ∠6 is 135°, so ∠2 is also 135°, because it is the corresponding \nangle of ∠6 and the lines l and m are parallel. \n∠8 is 135°, because it is the vertically opposite angle of ∠6. ∠4 is 135° \nbecause it is the corresponding angle of ∠8.\n∠2 is 135° because is the vertically opposite angle of ∠4. So, ∠2, ∠4, \n∠6, and ∠8 are all 135°.\n∠5 and ∠6 are a linear pair, together they measure 180°. If ∠6 is \n135°, then\n∠5 = 180 – 135 = 45°\nWe can similarly find out that ∠1, ∠3, and ∠7 measure 45°.\nExample 2: In Fig. 5.27, lines l and m are intersected by the transversal \nt. If ∠a is 120° and ∠f is 70°, are lines l and m parallel to each other?\ng\nl\nm\nt\nb\na\nd\nc\nf\nh\ne\n120°\n70°\nFig. 5.27\nSolution: ∠a is 120°, so ∠b is 60° because ∠a and ∠b form a linear pair.\n∠b is a corresponding angle of ∠f. If l and m are parallel, ∠b should be \nequal to ∠f, however, they are not equal.\nTherefore, lines l and m are not parallel to each other as the corresponding \nangles formed by the transversal t are not equal to each other.\nExample 3: In Fig. 5.28, parallel lines l and m are intersected by the \ntransversal t. If ∠3 is 50°, what is the measure of ∠6? \nl\nm\nt\n50°\n1\n3\n6\n8\nFig. 5.28\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nSolution: ∠3 is 50°; therefore, ∠2 is 130°, because ∠2 and ∠3 form a \nlinear pair, and linear pairs always add up to 180°.\n∠2 and ∠6 are corresponding angles, and they need to be equal since \nlines l and m are parallel.\nSo, ∠6 is 130°.\nAngles ∠3 and ∠6 are called interior angles.\n \nIs there a relation between ∠3 and ∠6? You could try to find the \nrelationship by taking different values for ∠3 and see what ∠6 is. \nOnce you find a relation, try to justify it or prove that this relation \nholds always. You will find that the sum of the interior angles on \nthe same side of the transversal always add up to 180°.\nExample 4: In Fig. 5.29, line segment AB is parallel to CD and AD is \nparallel to BC. ∠DAC is 65° and ∠ADC is 60°. What are the measures of \nangles ∠CAB, ∠ABC, and ∠BCD?\nSolution: Let us observe the parallel lines AB and CD. AD is a \ntransversal of these two lines.\t\n65°\n60°\nA\nB\nC\nD\nFig. 5.29\nWe know that the sum of the interior angles formed by a transversal \non a pair of parallel lines adds up to 180°. So\n∠ADC + ∠DAB = 180° \n60° + ∠DAB = 180°. \nSo ∠DAB = 120°.\nCan we find ∠CAB from this?\n∠DAB = ∠DAC + ∠CAB. \nSo 120° = 65° + ∠CAB.\nSo ∠CAB = 55°.\nLet us observe the parallel line segments AD and BC.

Each of the 4 angles in the first set has \na corresponding angle in the second set.\n•\t When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the \ncorresponding angles are equal. When a transversal intersects a pair \nof lines and the corresponding angles are equal, then the pair of lines \nis parallel.\n•\t When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the alternate \nangles are equal.\n•\t The interior angles on the same side formed by a transversal \nintersecting a pair of parallel lines always add up to 180°.\nSUMMARY", "source": "NCERT"}

What kind of number do you get? \nDoes it matter how many numbers are added?\nAny even number can be arranged in pairs without any leftovers. \nSome even numbers are shown here, arranged in pairs.\n \nAs we see in the figure, adding any number of even numbers\nwill result in a number which can still be arranged in pairs \nwithout any leftovers. In other words, the sum will always be an \neven number.\nNow, add a few odd numbers together. What kind of number do you \nget? Does it matter how many odd numbers are added?\nOdd numbers can not be arranged in pairs. An odd number is one \nmore than a collection of pairs. Some odd numbers are shown below:\n \nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nCan we also think of an odd number as one less than a collection \nof pairs?\nThis figure shows that the sum of two odd numbers must always \nbe even! This along with the other figures here are more examples \nof a proof!\nWe can see that \ntwo odd numbers added \ntogether can always be \narranged in pairs.\nWhat about adding 3 odd numbers? Can the resulting sum be arranged \nin pairs? No. \nExplore what happens to the sum of (a) 4 odd numbers, (b) 5 odd \nnumbers, and (c) 6 odd numbers.\nLet us go back to the puzzle Kishor was trying to solve. There are \n5 empty boxes. That means he has an odd number of boxes. All the \nnumber cards contain odd numbers.\nThey should add to 30, which is an even number. Since, adding any \n5 odd numbers will never result in an even number, Kishor cannot \narrange these cards in the boxes to add up to 30.\nTwo siblings, Martin and Maria, were born exactly one year apart. \nToday they are celebrating their birthday.

Can their ages be 51 and 52? 51 + 52 = 103.  Try some other \nconsecutive numbers and see if their sum is 112.\nThe counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... alternate between even and odd \nnumbers. In any two consecutive numbers, one will always be even \nand the other will always be odd!\nWhat would be the resulting sum of an even number and an odd \nnumber? We can see that their sum can’t be arranged in pairs and thus \nwill be an odd number.\nNumber Play\nSince 112 is an even number, and Martin’s and Maria’s ages are \nconsecutive numbers, they cannot add up to 112.\nWe use the word parity to denote the property of being even or odd. \nFor instance, the parity of the sum of any two consecutive numbers is \nodd. Similarly, the parity of the sum of any two odd numbers is even.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Using your understanding of the pictorial representation of odd \nand even numbers, find out the parity of the following sums:\n(a)\t Sum of 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers (e.g., even + even \n+ odd + odd)\n(b)\t Sum of 2 odd numbers and 3 even numbers\n(c)\t Sum of 5 even numbers\n(d)\t Sum of 8 odd numbers\n2.\t Lakpa has an odd number of ₹1 coins, an odd number of ₹5 coins \nand an even number of ₹10 coins in his piggy bank.

Meanwhile, in \na 3 × 4 grid, there are 12 small squares, \nwhich is an even number.\nGiven the dimensions of a grid, can you \ntell the parity of the number of small \nsquares without calculating the product?\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nFind the parity of the number of small squares in these grids:\n(a)\t 27 × 13\n(b)\t 42 × 78\n(c)\t 135 × 654\nParity of Expressions\nConsider the algebraic expression: 3n + 4.

Try to find more.\nCome up with expressions that always have odd parity.\nCome up with other expressions, like 3n + 4, which could have either \nodd or even parity.\nThe expression 6k + 2 evaluates to 8, 14, 20,... (for k = 1, 2, 3,...) — many \neven numbers are missing. \nAre there expressions using which we can list all the even numbers?\nHint: All even numbers have a factor 2.\nAre there expressions using which we can list all odd numbers?\nWe saw earlier how to express the nth term of the sequence of \nmultiples of 4, where n is the letter-number that denotes a position in \nthe sequence (e.g., first, twenty third, hundred and seventeenth, etc.).\nWhat would be the nth term for multiples of 2? Or, what is the nth even \nnumber?\nLet us consider odd numbers.\nWhat is the 100th odd number?\nTo answer this question, consider the following question:\nNumber Play\nWhat is the 100th even number?\nThis is 2 × 100 = 200.\nDoes this help in finding the 100th odd number? Let us compare the \nsequence of evens and odds term-by-term.\nEven Numbers:\t\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,...\nOdd Numbers:\t\n1, 3, 5, 7,  9,  11,...\nWe see that at any position, the value at the odd number sequence \nis one less than that in the even number sequence. Thus, the 100th odd \nnumber is 200 – 1 = 199.\nWrite a formula to find the nth odd number.\nLet us first describe the method that we have learnt to find the odd \nnumber at a given position:\n(a)\t Find the even number at that position. This is 2 times the \nposition number. \n(b)\t Then subtract 1 from the even number.\nWriting this in expressions, we get\n(a)\t 2n\n(b)\t 2n – 1\nThus, 2n is the formula that gives the nth even number, and 2n – 1 is \nthe formula that gives the nth odd number.\n6.3 Some Explorations in Grids\nObserve this 3 × 3 grid. It is filled following a simple \nrule — use numbers from 1 – 9 without repeating \nany of them. There are circled numbers outside the \ngrid.\nAre you able to see what the circled numbers \nrepresent?\nThe numbers in the yellow circles are the sums of the corresponding \nrows and columns.\nFill the grids below based on the rule mentioned above:\n5\n14\n12\n24\n3\n15\n17\n12\n7\n6\n2\n9\n16\n20\n17\n133\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nMake a couple of questions like this on your own and challenge your \npeers.\nTry solving the problem below.\nYou might have realised that it is not possible to \nfind a solution for this grid. Why is this the case?\nThe smallest sum possible is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. The \nlargest sum possible is 24 = 9 + 8 + 7. Clearly, any \nnumber in a circle cannot be less than 6 or \ngreater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26. \nTherefore, this is impossible!\nIn the earlier grids which we solved, \nKishor noticed that the sum of all the \nnumbers in the circles was always 90. Also, \nVidya observed that the sum of the circled \nnumbers for all three rows, or for all three \ncolumns, was always 45. Check if this is true \nin the previous grids you have solved.\nWhy should the row sums and column sums \nalways add to 45?\nFrom this grid, we can see that all the \nrow sums added together will be the same \nas the sum of the numbers 1 – 9. This can be \nseen for column sums as well. The sum of \nthe numbers 1 – 9 is\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.\nA square grid of numbers is called a \nmagic square if each row, each column and \neach diagonal, add up to the same number. \nThis number is called the magic sum. \nDiagonals are shown in the picture.   \nTrying to create a magic square by randomly filling \nthe grid with numbers may be difficult! This is because \nthere are a large number of ways of filling a 3 × 3 grid \nusing the numbers 1 – 9 without repetition. In fact, it \ncan be found that there are exactly 3,62,880 such ways. \nSurprisingly, the number of ways to fill in the grid can be \nfound without listing all of them. We will see in later years how to do this.\nInstead, we should proceed systematically to make a magic square. \nFor this, let us ask ourselves some questions.\n1.\t What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number?\n5\n19\n11\nThe 3 row sums \nadded together gives \n45! So does adding \nthe column sums.\n7\n6\n2\n9\n4+6+3\n5+2+8\n3+9+8\n6+1+2\n4+7+5\n7+1+9\nNumber Play\nLet us focus, for the moment, only on the row sums. We have seen that \nin a 3 × 3 grid with numbers 1 – 9, the total of row sums will always be \n45. Since in a magic square the row sums are all equal, and they add up \nto 45, they have to be 15 each. Thus, we have the following observation.\nObservation 1: In a magic square made using the numbers 1 – 9, the \nmagic sum must be 15.\n2.\t What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a \nmagic square?\nLet us consider the possibilities one by one. \nCan the central number be 9? If yes, then 8 must \ncome in one of the other squares. For example,\nIn this, we must have 8 + 9 + other number = 15.\nBut this is not possible! The same issue will \noccur no matter where we place 8.\nSo, 9 cannot be at the centre. Can the central \nnumber be 1?\nIf yes, then 2 should come in one of the other \nsquares. \nHere, we must have 2 + 1 + other number = 15.\nBut this is not possible because we are only \nusing the numbers 1 – 9. The same issue will \noccur no matter where we place 1.\nSo, 1 cannot be at the centre, either.\nUsing such reasoning, find out which other \nnumbers 1 – 9 cannot occur at the centre.\nThis exploration will lead us to the following \ninteresting observation.\nObservation 2: The number occurring at \nthe centre of a magic square, filled using 1 – 9, \nmust be 5.\nLet us now see where the smallest number 1 \nand the largest number 9 should come in a magic \nsquare. Our second observation tells us that \nthey will have to come in one of the boundary \npositions. Let us classify these positions into two categories:  \n9\n2\n135\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nCan 1 occur in a corner position? For example,\ncan it be placed as follows?\nIf yes, then there should exist three ways of \nadding 1 with two other numbers to give 15. \nWe have 1 + 5 + 9 = 1 + 6 + 8 = 15. Is any other \ncombination possible?\nSimilarly, can 9 can be placed in a corner position?\nObservation 3: The numbers 1 and 9 cannot occur in any corner, so \nthey should occur in one of the middle positions.\nCan you find the other possible positions for 1 and 9?\nNow, we have one full row or column of the magic square!\nTry completing it! \n[Hint: First fill the row or columns containing 1 and 9]\nFigure it Out\n1.\t How many different magic squares can be made using the \nnumbers 1 – 9? \n2.\t Create a magic square using the numbers 2 – 10.

The legend tells of a \ncatastrophic flood on the Lo River, during which the gods sent \na turtle to save the people. The turtle carried a 3 × 3 \ngrid on its back, with the numbers 1 to 9 arranged in \na magical pattern.\nMagic squares were studied in different parts of \nthe world at different points of time including India, Japan, \nCentral Asia, and Europe.\nIndian mathematicians have worked extensively on magic \nsquares, describing general methods of constructing them. \nThe work of Indian mathematicians was not just limited to 3 × 3 and \n4 × 4 grids, which we considered above, but also extended to 5 × 5 and \nother larger square grids. We shall learn more about these in \nlater grades.\nThe occurrence of magic squares is not limited to scholarly \nmathematical works. They are found in many places in India. \nThe picture to the right is of a 3 × 3 magic square found on \na pillar in a temple in Palani, Tamil Nadu. The temple dates \nback to the 8th century CE.\n3 × 3 magic squares can also be found in homes and shops in \nIndia. The Navagraha Yantra is one such example shown below.\n \n7\n9\n1\n3\n138\nNumber Play\nNotice that a different magic sum is associated with each graha. A \npicture of a Kubera Yantra is shown below:\n6.4 Nature’s Favourite Sequence: The Virahāṅka–\nFibonacci Numbers!\nThe sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . .  (Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers) \nis one of the most celebrated sequences in all of mathematics — it \noccurs throughout the world of Art, Science, and Mathematics. Even \nthough these numbers are found very frequently in Science, it is \nremarkable that these numbers were first discovered in the context of \nArt (specifically, poetry)! \nThe Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers thus provide a beautiful \nillustration of the close links between Art, Science, and Mathematics.\nDiscovery of the Virahāṅka Numbers\nThe Virahāṅka numbers first came up thousands of years ago in the \nworks of Sanskrit and Prakrit linguists in their study of poetry!\nIn the poetry of many Indian languages, including, Prakrit, Sanskrit, \nMarathi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, each syllable is classified as \neither long or short. \nA long syllable is pronounced for a longer duration than a short \nsyllable — in fact, for exactly twice as long. When singing such a poem, \na short syllable lasts one beat of time, and a long syllable lasts two \nbeats of time.\nThis leads to numerous mathematical questions, which the ancient \npoets in these languages considered extensively. A number of important \nmathematical discoveries were made in the process of asking and \nanswering these questions about poetry. \nOne of these particularly important questions was the following.\nHow many rhythms are there with 8 beats consisting of short syllables \n(1 beat) and long syllables (2 beats)? That is, in how many ways can one \n20\n22\n26\n28\n139\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7 \nfill 8 beats with short and long syllables, where a short syllable takes \none beat of time and a long syllable takes two beats of time.\nHere are some possibilities: \nlong long long long\nshort short short short short short short short\nshort long long short long\nlong long short short long\n\t\n      .\n\t\n      .\n\t\n      .\nCan you find others?\nPhrased more mathematically: In how many different ways can one \nwrite a number, say 8, as a sum of 1’s and 2’s?\nFor example, we have:\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n8 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n8 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n8 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\netc.\nDo you see other ways?\nHere are all the ways of writing each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, \nas the sum of 1’s and 2’s.\nDifferent Ways\nNumber of Ways\nn = 1\n1\nn = 2\n1 + 1\n2\nn = 3\n1 + 1 + 1\n1 + 2\n2 + 1\nn = 4\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n1 + 1 + 2\n1 + 2 + 1\n2 + 1 + 1\n2 + 2\nTry writing the number 5 as a sum of 1s and 2s in all possible ways \nin your notebook! How many ways did you find? (You should find 8 \ndifferent ways!) Can you figure out the answer without listing down all \nthe possibilities? Can you try it for n = 8? \nHere is a systematic way to write down all rhythms of short and long \nsyllables having 5 beats. Write a ‘1+’ in front of all rhythms having 4 \nbeats, and then a ‘2+’ in front of all rhythms having 3 beats. This gives \nus all the rhythms having 5 beats:     \nNumber Play\nn = 5\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n1 + 1 + 1 + 2\n1 + 1 + 2 + 1\n1 + 2 + 1 + 1\n1 + 2 + 2\n2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n2 + 1 + 2\n2 + 2 + 1\nThus, there are 8 rhythms having 5 beats!\nThe reason this method works is that every 5-beat rhythm must begin \nwith either a ‘1+’ or a ‘2+’. If it begins with a ‘1+’, then the remaining \nnumbers must give a 4-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. \nIf it begins with a 2+, then the remaining number must give a 3-beat \nrhythm, and we can write all those down. Therefore, the number of \n5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat rhythms, plus the number of \n3-beat rhythms.\nHow many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will \nbe the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms, \ni.e., 8 + 5 = 13. Thus, there are 13 rhythms having 6 beats.\nUse the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write \n6 as the sum of 1’s and 2’s in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways?\nThis beautiful method for counting all the rhythms of short syllables \nand long syllables having any given number of beats was first given by \nthe great Prakrit scholar Virahāṅka around the year 700 CE. He gave \nhis method in the form of a Prakrit poem! For this reason, the sequence \n1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . is known as the Virahāṅka sequence, and \nthe numbers in the sequence are known as the Virahāṅka numbers. \nVirahāṅka was the first known person in history to explicitly consider \nthese important numbers and write down the rule for their formation.\nOther scholars in India also considered these numbers in the \nsame poetic context. Virahāṅka was inspired by earlier work of the \nlegendary Sanskrit scholar Piṅgala, who lived around 300 BCE. After \nVirahāṅka, these numbers were also written about by Gopala (c. 1135 \nCE) and then by Hemachandra (c. 1150 CE).\nIn the West, these numbers have been known as the Fibonacci \nnumbers, after the Italian mathematician who wrote about them in \nthe year 1202 CE — about 500 years after Virahāṅka.

As we know, it consists of:\n•\t \tthree corner points, that we call the vertex of the triangle, and \n•\t \tthree line segments or the sides of the triangle that join the pairs \nof vertices.\nTriangles come in various shapes. Some of them are shown below.\nB\nC\n∆ ABC\nA\nX\nZ\nY\n∆ YZX\n∆WUV\nV\nU\nW\n∆BAU\nA\nB\nU\nObserve the symbol used to denote a triangle and how the triangles \nare named using their vertices. While naming a triangle, the vertices \ncan come in any order.\nThe three sides meeting at the corners give rise to three angles that \nwe call the angles of the triangle. For example, in ∆ABC, these angles \nare ∠CAB, ∠ABC, ∠BCA, which we simply denote as ∠A, ∠B and ∠C, \nrespectively.\nWhat happens when the three vertices lie on a straight line?\n7.1 Equilateral Triangles\nAmong all the triangles, the equilateral triangles are the most symmetric \nones. These are triangles in which all the sides are of equal lengths. Let \nus try constructing them.\nConstruct a triangle in which all the sides are of length 4 cm.\nA Tale of Three Intersecting Lines\nHow did you construct this triangle and what tools did you use? Can \nthis construction be done only using a marked ruler (and a pencil)?\nConstructing this triangle using just a ruler is certainly possible. But \nthis might require several trials. Say we draw the base — let us call it \nAB — of length 4 cm (see the figure below), and mark the third point C \nusing a ruler such that AC = 4 cm. This may not lead to BC also having \na length of 4 cm. If this happens, we will have to keep making attempts \nto mark C till we get BC to be 4 cm long.\nA\nB\nC\n4 cm?\n4 cm\n4 cm\nHow do we make this construction more efficient?\nRecall solving a similar problem in the previous year using a compass \n(in the Chapter ‘Playing with Constructions’). We had to mark the top \npoint of a ‘house’ which is 5 cm from two other points. The method we \nused to get that point can also be used here.\nAfter constructing AB = 4 cm, we can do the following.\nStep 1: Using a compass, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 4 cm \nfrom A, as shown in the figure. The point C is somewhere on this arc. \nHow do we mark it?\nA\nB\n4 cm\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nStep 2: Construct another arc of radius 4 cm from B.\nA\nB\n4 cm\nLet C be the point of intersection of the arcs.\nThe construction ensures that both AC and BC are of length 4 cm.

But it will involve several trials.\nA Tale of Three Intersecting Lines\nHow do we construct this triangle more efficiently?\nChoose one of the given lengths to be the base of the triangle: say 4 \ncm. Draw the base. Let A and B be the base vertices, and call the third \nvertex C. Let AC = 5 cm and BC = 6 cm.\nFig. 7.1\nLike we did in the case of equilateral triangles, let us first get all the \npoints that are at a 5 cm distance from A. These points lie on the circle \nwhose centre is A and has radius 5 cm. The point C must lie somewhere \non this circle. How do we find it?\n4 cm\nA\nB\n5 cm\nFig. 7.2\nWe will make use of the fact that the point C is 6 cm away from B.\nConstruct an arc of radius 6 cm from B.\nA\nB\n5 cm\n6 cm\nFig. 7.3\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nThe required point C is one of the points of intersection of the two \ncircles.\nThe reason why the point of \nintersection is the third vertex is the \nsame as for equilateral triangles. This \npoint lies on both the circles. Hence \nits distance from A is the radius of \nthe circle centred at A (5 cm) and its \ndistance from B is the same as the \nradius of the circle centred at B (6 cm).\nLet us summarise the steps of \nconstruction, noting that constructing \nfull circles is not necessary to get the \nthird vertex (see Fig. 7.2 and 7.3).\nStep 1: \u0007Construct the base AB with one of the side lengths. Let us choose \nAB = 4 cm (see Fig. 7.1).\nStep 2: \u0007From A, construct a sufficiently long arc of radius 5 cm \n(see Fig. 7.2).\nStep 3: \u0007From B, construct an arc of radius 6 cm such that it intersects \nthe first arc (see Fig. 7.3).\nStep 4: \u0007The point where both the arcs meet is the required third \nvertex C.

Are there \nlengths for which it is impossible to construct a triangle? Let us explore \nthis.\nConstruct a triangle with sidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm.\nWhat is happening? Are you able to construct the triangle?\nHere is another set of lengths: 2 cm, 3 cm, and 6 cm. Check if a triangle \nis possible for these sidelengths.\nTry to find more sets of lengths for which a triangle construction \nis impossible. See if you can find any pattern in them.\nWe see that a triangle is possible for some sets of lengths and \nnot possible for others. How do we check if a triangle exists for a given \nset of lengths? One way is to actually try to construct the triangle and \ncheck if it is possible. Is there a more efficient way to check this?\nTriangle Inequality\nConsider the lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm. Does there exist a triangle \nhaving these as sidelengths?\nTo tackle this question, let us study a property of triangles. Imagine \na small plot of plain land having a tent, a tree, and a pole. Imagine \nyou are at the entrance of the tent and want to go to the tree. Which is \nthe shorter path: (i) the straight-line path to the tree (the red path) or \n(ii) the straight-line path from the tent to the pole, followed by the \nstraight-line path from the pole to the tree (the yellow path)?\nMath \nTalk\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nClearly, the direct straight-line path from the tent to the tree is shorter \nthan the roundabout path via the pole. In fact, the direct straight-line \npath is the shortest possible path to the tree from the tent.\nWill the direct path between any two points be shorter than the \nroundabout path via a third point? Clearly, the answer is yes. \nCan this understanding be used to tell something about the existence \nof a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm?\nLet us suppose that there is a triangle for this set of lengths. Remember \nthat at this point we are not sure about the existence of the triangle but \nwe are only supposing that it exists. Let us draw a rough diagram.\nFig. 7.4\nA Tale of Three Intersecting Lines\nDoes everything look right with this triangle?\nIf this triangle were possible, then the direct path between any two \nvertices should be shorter than the roundabout path via the third \nvertex. Is this true for our rough diagram?\nLet us consider the paths between B and C.\nDirect path length = BC = 10 cm\nWhat is the length of the roundabout path via the vertex A? It is the \nsum of the lengths of line segments BA and AC.\nRoundabout path length = BA + AC = 15 cm + 30 cm = 45 cm\n\u0007Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes.\nLet us now consider the paths between A and B.\nDirect path length = AB = 15 cm\nFinding the length of the roundabout path via the vertex C, we get \nRoundabout path length = AC + CB = 30 cm + 10 cm = 40 cm\n\u0007Is the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? Yes.\nFinally, consider paths between C and A.\nDirect path length = CA = 30 cm\nRoundabout path length = CB + BA = 10 cm + 15 cm = 25 cm\nIs the direct path length shorter than the roundabout path length? In \nthis case, the direct path is longer, which is absurd. Can such a triangle \nexist? No.\nTherefore, a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm \ncannot exist.\nWe are thus able to see without construction why a triangle for the \nset of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm cannot exist. We have been able \nto figure this out through spatial intuition and reasoning. \nRecall how we used similar intuition and reasoning to discover \nproperties of intersecting and parallel lines. We will continue to do \nthis as we explore geometry.\nCan we say anything about the existence of a triangle having sidelengths \n3 cm, 3 cm and 7 cm? Verify your answer by construction.\n“In the rough diagram in Fig. 7.4, is it possible to assign \nlengths in a different order such that the direct paths are \nalways coming out to be shorter than the roundabout \npaths? If this is possible, then a triangle might exist.”\nIs such rearrangement of lengths possible in the triangle?\nMath \nTalk\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nFigure it Out\n1.\t We checked by construction that there are no triangles having \nsidelengths 3 cm, 4 cm and 8 cm; and 2 cm, 3 cm and 6 cm. Check if \nyou could have found this without trying to construct the triangle.\n2.\t Can we say anything about the existence of a triangle for each of \nthe following sets of lengths?\n(a)\t \t10 km, 10 km and 25 km\n(b)\t \t5 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm\n(c)\t \t12 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm\nYou would have realised that using a rough figure and comparing \nthe direct path lengths with their corresponding roundabout path \nlengths is the same as comparing each length with the sum of the other \ntwo lengths. There are three such comparisons to be made.\n3.\t For  each set of lengths seen so far, you might have noticed that \n\t\nin at least two of the comparisons, the direct length was less \nthan the sum of the other two (if not, check again!). For example, \nfor the set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm, there are two \ncomparisons where this happens:\n10 < 15 + 30\n15 < 10 + 30\nBut this doesn’t happen for the third length: 30 > 10 + 15.\nWill this always happen? That is, for any set of lengths, will there be at \nleast two comparisons where the direct length is less than the sum of \nthe other two? Explore for different sets of lengths.\nFurther, for a given set of lengths, is it possible to identify which \nlengths will immediately be less than the sum of the other two, without \ncalculations? \n[Hint: Consider the direct lengths in the increasing order.]\nGiven three sidelengths, what do we need to compare to check for the \nexistence of a triangle?\nWhen each length is smaller than the sum of the other two, we say \nthat the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. For example, the set 3, \n4, 5 satisfies the triangle inequality whereas, the set 10, 15, 30 does not \nsatisfy the triangle inequality.\nWe have seen that lengths such as 10, 15, 30 that do not satisfy the \ntriangle inequality cannot be the sidelengths of a triangle.\nTry\nThis\nA Tale of Three Intersecting Lines\nDoes a triangle exist with sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm?\nThis satisfies the triangle inequality:\n8 < 4 + 5 = 9\nWhy do we not need to check the other two sides?\nThis means that all the direct path lengths are less than the \nroundabout path lengths. Does this confirm the existence of a triangle? \nIf one of the direct path lengths had been longer, we could have \nconcluded that a triangle would surely not exist. But in this case, we \ncan only say that a triangle may or may not exist.\nFor the triangle to exist, the arcs that we construct to get the third \nvertex must intersect. Is it possible to determine that this will happen \nwithout actually carrying out the construction?\nVisualising the construction of circles\nLet us imagine that we start the construction by constructing the \nlongest side as the base. Let AB be the base of length 8 cm. The next \nstep is the construction of sufficiently long arcs corresponding to the \nother two lengths: 4 cm and 5 cm.\nInstead of just constructing the arcs, let us complete the full circles. \nSuppose, we construct a circle of radius 4 cm with A as the centre.\nNow, suppose that a circle of radius 5 cm is constructed, centred at B. \nCan you draw a rough diagram of the resulting figure?\nNote that in the figure below, AX = 4 cm and AB = 8 cm. So, what is \nBX? Does this length help in visualising the resulting figure?\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nSince BX = 4 cm, and the radius of the circle centred at B is 5 cm, it is \nclear that the circles will intersect each other at two points.\nFig. 7.5: Circles intersecting each other at two points\nWhat does this tell us about the existence of a triangle? The points \nA and B along with either of the points of intersection of the circles \nwill give us the required triangle. Thus, there exists a triangle having \nsidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Which of the following lengths can be the sidelengths of a triangle? \nExplain your answers. Note that for each set, the three lengths have \nthe same unit of measure. \n(a)\t 2, 2, 5\t\n(b)\t 3, 4, 6\n(c)\t 2, 4, 8\t\n(d)\t 5, 5, 8\n(e)\t 10, 20, 25\t\n(f)\t\n10, 20, 35\n(g)\t 24, 26, 28\nWe observe from the previous problems that whenever there is \na set of lengths satisfying the triangle inequality (each length < \nsum of the other two lengths), there is a triangle with those three \nlengths as sidelengths.\nWill triangles always exist when a set of lengths satisfies the triangle \ninequality? How can we be sure?\nA Tale of Three Intersecting Lines\nWe can be sure of the existence of a triangle only if we can show that \nthe circles intersect internally (as in Fig. 7.5) whenever the triangle \ninequality is satisfied. But are there other possibilities when the two \ncircles are constructed? Let us visualise and study them.\nThe following different cases can be conceived:\nA\nB\nCase 1: Circles touch each other\nA\nB\nCase 2: Circles do not intersect\nA\nB\nCase 3: Circles intersect each other internally\nNote that while constructing the circles, we take\n(a)\t\nthe length of the base AB = longest of the given length\n(b)\t the radii of the circles to be the smaller two lengths.\nWhich of the above-mentioned cases will lead to the formation of a \ntriangle? Clearly, triangles are formed only when the circles intersect \neach other internally (Case 3).\nLet us study each of these cases by finding the relation between the \nradii (the smaller two lengths) and AB (longest length).\nCase 1: Circles touch each other at a point\nFor this case to happen,\nsum of the two radii = AB\nor \nsum of the two smaller lengths = longest length\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nA\nB\nX\nCase 2: Circles do not intersect internally\nFor this case to happen, what should be the relation between the radii \nand AB?\nIt can be seen from the figure that,\nsum of the two radii < AB\nor \nsum of the the two smaller lengths < longest length\nA\nB\nCase 3: Circles intersect each other\nA\nradius 1\nradius 2\nB\nA Tale of Three Intersecting Lines\nAB is composed of one radius and a part of the other. So, \nsum of the two radii > AB,\nor \nsum of the two smaller lengths > longest length\nCan we use this analysis to tell if a triangle exists when the lengths \nsatisfy the triangle inequality?\nIf the given lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, then the sum of \nthe two smaller lengths is greater than the longest length. This means \nthat this will lead to Case 3 where the circles intersect internally, and \nso a triangle exists.\nHow will the two circles turn out for a set of lengths that do not satisfy \nthe triangle inequality? Find 3 examples of sets of lengths for which \nthe circles: \n(a)\t\ntouch each other at a point,\n(b)\t do not intersect.\nFrame a complete procedure that can be used to check the existence of \na triangle.\nConclusion\nIf a given set of three lengths satisfies the triangle inequality, then a \ntriangle exists having those as sidelengths.

In the beginning, the relationship between the third angle \nand the other two angles was not at all clear. However, a simple idea of \ndrawing a line parallel to the base through the top vertex (as in Fig.  7.7) \nsuddenly made the relationship obvious. This ingenious idea can be \nfound in a very influential book in the history of mathematics called \n‘The Elements’.

Do you \nsee any relation between the exterior angle and these two angles?\n[Hint: From angle sum property, we have ∠A + ∠B + ∠ACB = 180°.]\nWe also have ∠ACD + ∠ACB = 180°, since they form a straight angle. \nWhat does this show?\n7.4 Constructions Related to Altitudes of Triangles\nThere is another set of useful measurements with respect to a triangle —  \nthe height of each of its vertices with respect to the opposite sides.\nIn the world around us, we talk of the \nheights of various objects: the height of a \nperson, the height of a tree, the height of \na building, etc. What do we mean by the \nword ‘height’?\nConsider a triangle ABC.

Label the vertices A, B, C taking BC to \nbe the base. \nConstruct the altitude from A to BC, \nConstructing the altitude using just a ruler is not accurate.

Isosceles triangles \nhave two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three \ndifferent lengths. \nCan a similar classification be done based on equality of angles?

Can we frame a rule that tells us how to divide two fractions?\nLet us consider the previous problem.\nIn every division problem we have \na dividend, divisor and quotient. The \ntechnique we have been using to get \nthe quotient is:\n1.\t \tFirst, find the number which gives \n1 when multiplied by the divisor. \nWe see that the resulting number is \na fraction whose numerator is the \ndivisor’s denominator and denominator is the divisor’s numerator.\n\t\nFor the divisor 3\n5 this fraction is 5\n3. We call 5\n3 the reciprocal of 3\n5. \nWhen we multiply a fraction by its reciprocal, we get 1. So, the first \nstep in our technique is to find the divisor’s reciprocal.\n2 × 2 × 1\n5  = 1\nAnswer\n5 × 5\n3 × 2\n3  = 2\nAnswer\n3 ÷ 3\n5 \nDivisor\nQuotient\nDividend\n= 5\n3 × 2\n3 = 10\n188\nWorking with Fractions\n2.\t \tWe then multiply the dividend with this reciprocal to get the \nquotient.\n\t\nSummarising, to divide two fractions:\n•\t \tFind the reciprocal of the divisor\n•\t \tMultiply this by the dividend to get the quotient.\n            So,\t\n a\nb ÷ c\nd = d\nc × a\nb = d × a\nc × b.\nThis can be rewritten as:\na\nb ÷ c\nd = a\nb × d\nc = a × d\nb × c. \nAs with methods and formulas for addition, subtraction, and \nmultiplication of fractions that you learnt earlier, this method and \nformula for division of fractions, in this general form, was first explicitly \nstated by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (628 CE).\nSo, to evaluate, for example, 2\n3 ÷ 3\n5 using Brahmagupta’s formula \nabove, we write:\n3 ÷ 3\n5 = 2\n3 × 5\n3 = 2 × 5\n3 × 3 = 10\n9 .\nDividend, Divisor and the Quotient\nWhen we divide two whole numbers, say 6 ÷ 3, we get the quotient 2. \nHere the quotient is less than the dividend.\n6 ÷ 3 = 2, 2 < 6\nBut what happens when we divide 6 by 1\n4 ?\n6 ÷ 1\n4 = 24. \nHere the quotient is greater than the dividend!\nWhat happens when we divide 1\n8 by 1\n4 ?\n8 ÷ 1\n4 = 1\n2. \nHere too the quotient is greater than the dividend.\nWhen do you think the quotient is less than the dividend and when \nis it greater than the dividend?\nIs there a similar relationship between the divisor and the quotient?\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nUse your understanding of such relationships in multiplication to \nanswer the questions above.\n8.3 Some Problems Involving Fractions\nExample 3: Leena made 5 cups of tea. She used 1\n4 litre of milk for this. \nHow much milk is there in each cup of tea?\nLeena used 1\n4 litres of milk in 5 cups of tea. So, in 1 cup of tea the \nvolume of milk should be:\n4 ÷ 5.\nWriting this as multiplication, we have:\n5 × (milk per cup) = 1\n4.\nWe perform the division as follows as per Brahmagupta’s method:\nThe reciprocal of 5 (the divisor) is 1\n5.\nMultiplying this reciprocal by the dividend ( 1\n4 ), we get\n5 × 1\n4 = 1\n20.\nSo, each cup of tea has 1\n20 litre of milk.\nExample 4: Some of the oldest examples of working with non-unit \nfractions occur in humanity’s oldest geometry texts, the Śhulbasūtra. \nHere is an example from Baudhāyana’s Śhulbasūtra (c. 800 BCE). \nCover an area of 7 1\n2 square units with square bricks each of whose \nsides is 1\n5 units.\n4 litres of 5 cups\nMilk in \n1 cup\nWorking with Fractions\nHow many such square bricks are needed?\nEach square brick has an area of 1\n5 × 1\n5 = 1\n25 square units.\nThe total area to be covered is 7 1\n2 sq. units = 15\n2  sq. units.\nAs (Number of bricks) × (Area of a brick) = Total Area,\nNumber of bricks = 15\n2  ÷ 1\n25. \nThe reciprocal of the divisor is 25.\nMultiplying the reciprocal by the dividend, we get\n25 × 15\n2  = 25 × 15\n = 375\n2 .\nExample 5: This problem was posed by Chaturveda Pṛithūdakasvāmī \n(c. \n860 \nCE) \nin \nhis \ncommentary \non \nBrahmagupta’s \nbook \nBrāhmasphuṭasiddhānta.\nFour fountains fill a cistern. The first fountain can fill the cistern in a \nday. The second can fill it in half a day. The third can fill it in a quarter of \na day. The fourth can fill the cistern in one fifth of a day. If they all flow \ntogether, in how much time will they fill the cistern? \nLet us solve this problem step by step.\nIn a day, the number of times —\n•\t \tthe first fountain will fill the cistern is 1÷ 1 = 1\n•\t \tthe second fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ 1\n2 = _____\n•\t \tthe third fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷  1\n4= _____\n•\t \tthe fourth fountain will fill the cistern is 1 ÷ 1\n5 = _____\nThe number of times the four fountains together will fill the cistern \nin a day is ___ + ____ + ___ + ____ = 12.\nThus, the total time needed by the four fountains to fill the cistern \ntogether is 1\n12 days.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nFractional Relations\nHere is a square with some lines drawn inside.\nFig. 8.4\nWhat fraction of area of the whole square does the shaded region \noccupy? \nThere are different ways to solve this problem. Here is one of them:\nLet the area of the whole square be 1 square unit.\nWe can see that the top right square (in Fig. 8.5), occupies 1\n4 of the \narea of the whole square.\nFig. 8.5\nArea of red square = 1\n4 square units.\nMath \nTalk\nFig, 8.6\nWorking with Fractions\nLet us look at this red square. The area of the triangle inside it \n(coloured yellow) is half the area of the red square. So,\t \t\nthe area of the yellow triangle = 1\n2 × 1\n4 = 1\n8 square units.\nWhat fraction of this yellow triangle is shaded? \nThe shaded region occupies 3\n4 of the area of the \nyellow triangle. Are you able to see why?\nThe area of shaded part = 3\n4 × 1\n8 = 3\n32 square units.\nThus, the shaded region occupies 3\n32 of the area of the whole square.\nIn each of the figures given below, find the fraction of the big square \nthat the shaded region occupies.\nWe will solve more interesting problems of this kind in a later \nchapter.\nA Dramma-tic Donation\nThe \nfollowing \nproblem \nis \ntranslated \nfrom \nBhāskarāchārya’s \n(Bhāskara II’s) book, Līlāvatī, written in 1150 CE. \n“O wise one! A miser gave to a beggar 1\n5 of 1\n16 of 1\n4 of  1\n2 of 2\n3 of 3\n4 of \na dramma. If you know the mathematics of fractions well, tell me O \nchild, how many cowrie shells were given by the miser to the beggar.”\nDramma refers to a silver coin used in those times. The tale says that \n1 dramma was equivalent to 1280 cowrie shells. Let’s see what fraction \nof a dramma the person gave:\n(\n2 × 2\n3 × 3\n4 × 1\n5 × 1\n16 × 1\n4)\nth\n part of a dramma.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\nEvaluating it gives \n7680 . \nUpon simplifying to its lowest form, we get\n7680 = \n1280.\nSo, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar.\nYou can see in the answer Bhāskarāchārya’s humour! The miser had \ngiven the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie).\nAround the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in \ndifferent kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used \nwere gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called \ndrammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and \ncowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied \ndepending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of \ncoins and their purity. \nGold coins had high-value and were used in large transactions and \nto store wealth. Silver coins were more commonly used in everyday \ntransactions. Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller \ntransactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were \nused in very small transactions and as change.\nIf we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4 \ncopper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells, \n1 copper pana = 1\n48 gold dinar (\n12 × 1\n4)\n1 cowrie shell =____ copper panas\n1 cowrie shell =____ gold dinar.\nA Pinch of History  \nAs you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing \na critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing \nand dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions \nas we use them today — equipped with the arithmetic operations of \naddition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in \nIndia. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Śhulbasūtra — which \ngo back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction \nof fire altars for rituals — used general non-unit fractions extensively, \nincluding performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3.\nFractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of \nIndia as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to \nthe reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of \nthe revered Jain scholar Umasvati.\nWorking with Fractions\nGeneral rules for performing arithmetic operations on fractions — \nin essentially the modern form in which we carry them out today — \nwere first codified by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in \n628 CE. We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting \ngeneral fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta \nwrote: \n“Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the \nproduct of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.” \n(Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.1.3)\nThat is,\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\na\nb × c\nd = a × c\nb × d .\nFor division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote:\n“The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator \nand denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then \nmultiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new) \ndenominator.”\nBhāskara II in his book Līlāvatī in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s \nstatement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal:\n“Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of \nthe first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Līlāvatī, Verse 2.3.40)\nBoth of these verses are equivalent to the formula: \na\nb ÷ c\nd = a\nb ×d\nc = a × d\nb × c .\nBhāskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣhya on \nAryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the \ngeometric interpretation of multiplication \nof fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms \nof the division of a square into rectangles \nvia equal divisions along the length and \nbreadth. \nMany \nother \nIndian \nmathematicians, \nsuch as Śhrīdharāchārya (c. 750 CE), \nMahāvīrāchārya (c. 850 CE), Caturveda \nPṛithūdakasvāmī (c. 860 CE), and Bhāskara II \n(c. 1150 CE) developed the usage of arithmetic \nof fractions significantly further. \nThe Indian theory of fractions and \narithmetic operations on them was \ntransmitted to, and its usage developed further, by Arab and African \nmathematicians such as al-Hassâr (c. 1192 CE) of Morocco. The theory \nwas then transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few \nBhāskara I’s visual explanation that \n5 x 1\n4 = 1\n \n20\n5\n4\nGanita Prakash | Grade 7\ncenturies, and came into general use in Europe in only around the \n17th century, after which it spread worldwide.

And what can \nwe learn from the patterns that we see in nature? \nTo do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the \nclassroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities \nand experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not \njust be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones \nto a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of \nour place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you \nto see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just \nabout discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young \nscience explorers, you will soon see how human activities are \nlinked to what happens in the natural world and are connected \nto the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that \nscience can play in addressing environmental challenges and \nhelp in creating a more sustainable world. \nBut let’s get back into this book for now. You will read about \ntopics in diﬀ erent ﬁ elds of science, from physics and chemistry \nto biology and earth sciences. While they might appear as \ndiﬀ erent chapters, just as we had said in Grade 6, they are \nall interconnected. Scientiﬁ c ideas in one area often inspire \ndiscoveries in another, or at least allow us to ask questions in \nanother area. So, let’s take a quick journey through our book for \nthis year. We will start by looking at the properties of materials \naround us, mostly the things we experience but perhaps never \nask questions about — why are some fruits sour? What happens \nwhen we wash a haldi stain on our school uniform? \nThe Ever-Evolving World of Science\nWe then move on and play with some \nelectric batteries, lamps and wires to try to \nﬁ nd other kinds of properties of materials. \nWhat kind of materials do we need to make a \nlamp glow? This will lead us to classifying \nmaterials based on their properties — and we \nwill enter the world of metals and non-metals. \nWe know from our experience that a torch \nbattery runs out eventually, and can’t be used \nagain. We’ll explore what kind of changes happen around us. \nSome changes can be reversed and others cannot be reversed. \nBatteries run out, ice melts into water, fruits ripen, rocks break \ninto pebbles… what kind of changes are these? Some of these \nhappen, or happen faster, when things are heated. We will look \nat how heat ﬂ ows — whether it is the melting of an ice cube in a \nglass, or the melting of a glacier. Water is, of course, everywhere, \nand with the heat from the Sun, it evaporates from the seas and \nfalls as rain, perhaps trickling down into the ground, somewhere \nfar away.  \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nHowever, it isn’t just changes in materials \naround us that we see, or the hidden changes in \nwater that we do not see. As we are growing, our \nbodies are changing as well. Especially around \nthe middle-school years, our bodies are changing \nrapidly! Why? Not just us humans, there are \nlife processes that are essential to all animals \nfor their survival. To grow, we have to eat and \nbreathe, blood has to circulate the nutrients \nfrom the food all over the body and so on. But \nwhy animals alone? Don’t plants also need food \nto grow? How do they get their food? Do they also \nbreathe? How? Over the time that life has evolved \non our planet Earth, it has ﬁ gured out how to do this in a beautiful \nand carefully balanced way. Ah, but what is time? The clock on \nthe wall or a wrist watch tells us the time and how it passes. We \nget prepared to go to school in the morning and are ready to sleep \nat night but have you thought about how we measure time? And \nhow fast does something happen? \nLong before the age of electric clocks and digital watches, early \nhumans observed the shadows of objects in the Sun and used the \nposition of the shadows to tell the time. Light and shadows are \nnot just useful for shadow \npuppets or to tell the time. \nNaturally, light helps us see \nand today, we’ve developed \na lot of ways to generate \nlight (so we can read a \nbook at night, even when \nthe Sun doesn’t shine). But, \nmore importantly, asking \nquestions about the nature \nThe Ever-Evolving World of Science\nof light has given us a very deep understanding of the universe \nwe live in. While we’ll perhaps learn about it only later, light and \nshadows are not just limited to things around us at home. \nEven the Earth and the Moon can cast shadows, leading to \nthe fascinating phenomena of eclipses. And of course, we have \nday and night that depend on receiving light from the Sun. To \nunderstand all of this, we need to know how the Earth rotates \naround its axis, how the Moon goes around the Earth, and the \nEarth around the Sun. And the consequences of these movements \non life on our beautiful planet. While all this might have your \nhead spinning, think about it. Isn’t it amazing that we humans \ncan wonder about the wonderful world we live in?\nIn the chapters that follow, you’ll \nalso make simple observations and \ndo fun experiments, and dive into \ntopics that need careful thinking. \nEach chapter builds on what you \nalready know and encourages you \nto ask questions, explore, do hands-\non experiments, and think like a \nscientist! As you will ﬁ nd out, even \nthose experiments that seem to \nconﬁ rm what we think will happen, \nmight \nlead \nto \nsome \nadditional \nquestions that might need more \nexperiments and more questions. \n1.1 Happy Exploring!\ng\nppy\np\nActivity 1.1: Question the Answer\nIn school or during tests, you’re usually given questions and \nexpected to ﬁ nd the answers.

Also, in the previous chapter, we discussed the \nprocess through which animals obtain nutrition.  \nWe know that animals eat food to grow, but what about \nplants? Have you ever seen plants eating food like animals do? \nAs animals grow, their size and weight usually increase, and their \nbodies undergo various changes. What changes do you notice in \nplants when they grow?\nWe learnt that food provides nutrients like carbohydrates, \nfats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which, along with water, \nare all essential for growth. Let us explore how plants obtain \nnutrients for their growth.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n10.1 How Do Plants Grow?\nLook around your neighbourhood. Have you observed any \nchanges in a plant during its life span? As a plant grows, new \nleaves and branches emerge, its height increases, and its stem \nthickens. What do you think causes these changes? Discuss with \nyour friends and provide your explanation as well. \nWhen we water plants \nregularly, they grow better. \nSo, I think water also \ncontributes to its growth.\nI think sunlight plays \nsome role in the growth \nof  plants.\nMaybe plants take \nup food from the soil \nthrough their roots. \nI think, maybe, ________ \nplays some role!\nLet us perform an experiment to test some of these explanations. \nActivity 10.1: Let us test some explanations \nTake three earthen pots (or used bottles/containers) of the \nsame size ﬁ lled with garden soil.

The plant in Pot \nB may have died as it did not get water even though it received \nadequate sunlight.\nWhat do you infer from the observations made in this activity? \nThe results indicate that plants require both sunlight and water \nfor their growth. \n1   This experiment will need two weeks.

It records \nuseful observations about plant growth, soil, and agricultural practices to \nhelp improve crop health, growth and production. The knowledge in the \ntext seems to be based on practical experiences and patterns seen over \ntime. These ideas were then systematically documented to guide farming \npractices. For instance, there are references to diﬀ erent methods of organic \nmanure preparation, such as mixing water, barley, and various seeds, like \ngreen, black, and horse grams.\nds\nto\nhe\ner\nng\nic\nke\n10.2  How Do Plants Get Food for their \nGrowth?\nWe know that animals get their food from plants, either directly by \neating plants or indirectly by eating animals that in turn eat plants \nfor their nutrition and growth. But how do plants obtain the food \nthey need to grow? Unlike animals, plants do not eat food. \n10.2.1 Leaves: the ̒ food factories̓ of plants\nPlants store food in the form of starch, a type of carbohydrate. \nThis starch is produced in the leaves of a plant which, by design, \nare generally broad and ﬂ at. These are mostly green because of \nthe presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll, that helps in \ncapturing sunlight eﬃ  ciently.\nLet us ﬁ nd out the role chlorophyll plays in the preparation of \nfood in the form of starch in plants.  \np\nActivity 10.2: Let us check (demonstration activity)\nThe teacher may demonstrate this \nactivity.\nKeep a leaf in boiling water  for \nﬁ ve minutes to soften it.\nDip this leaf in a test tube \ncontaining alcohol.\nPlace the test tube in a beaker \ncontaining \nboiling \nwater. \nWait until the leaf becomes \ncolourless (Fig. 10.2a). \n(a) Boiling set-up\n(b) Iodine test\nFig. 10.2: Starch test in a leaf\nWater\nAlcohol\nLeaf\nSprit lamp\nWire\ngauze\nTest \ntube\nIodine \nsolution\nLife Processes in Plants\nTake out the leaf and place it on a plate. \nNow, put a few drops of diluted iodine solution with the help \nof a dropper on the decolourised leaf (Fig. 10.2b). Wait for a \nfew minutes and observe.\nIf the colour of the leaf changes to blue-black, it indicates the \npresence of starch.\nCaution — Alcohol should never be placed near a heat source directly, \nas it is highly ﬂ ammable and can easily lead to ﬁ re and burns. \nDid you wonder why we decolourise the leaf in the \nbeginning of this activity?\nDecolourisation of a leaf enables us to easily observe \ncolour change and, thus, the presence of starch.\nDIVE\nEEPER\nDIVE\nEEPER\nIn Activity 10.1, we have learnt that water and sunlight are \nessential for plant growth. In Activity 10.2, we have discovered \nthat green leaves store starch as food. \nBhaskar loves gardening during his free time. Being a curious \nstudent, he often looks around his garden and wonders how \nplants produce food. From his experiences, Bhaskar knows \nthat water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. But he \nwonders if sunlight contributes to the production of food in the \nform of starch in plants.\nHow does sunlight \ncontribute in the production \nof starch in plants? \nActivity 10.3: Let us check \nBhaskar took a leaf having both green and non-green patches \nfrom each of two similar potted plants — one kept in sunlight and \nthe other kept in the dark for 36 hours. He wanted to compare \nthe leaves before and after the starch test. \nHe made a sketch of the leaves to record the location of the \ngreen and the non-green patches on them with the help of a \ntracing paper. After that, he performed an iodine test (as shown \nin Activity 10.2) on the leaves. Bhaskar recorded his observations \nin Table 10.2. \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nPlant kept in sunlight\nPlant kept in the dark\n1.\n2.\nGreen and \nnon-green \npatches on \nthe leaf\nGreen \npatches of \nleaf turned \nblue-black\nNo change in \ncolour\nGreen and \nnon-green \npatches on \nthe leaf\nLight conditions for \npotted plant\nInitial colours \nbefore iodine test\nFinal colours after \niodine test\nS.No.\nTable 10.2:  Presence of starch in green and non-green parts of the \nleaves of plants\nf \nd\nIn Table 10.2, Bhaskar recorded a blue-black colour (indicating \nthe presence of starch) on the green patches of the leaf obtained \nfrom the plant placed in sunlight. Bhaskar also recorded that the \nleaf obtained from the plant kept in the dark does not show a \nblue-black colour, even on the green patches, indicating that no \nstarch has been produced. Non-green patches of the leaf obtained \nfrom the plant placed in sunlight do not turn blue-black. Does it \nindicate that there is no chlorophyll present in those patches? \nThe non-green patches may not have suﬃ  cient chlorophyll to \nprepare enough starch to be detected using the iodine test. \nFASCINATING FACTS\nSome plant leaves appear red, violet, \nor brown because they contain more \nof these coloured pigments than the \ngreen-coloured chlorophyll. This hides \nthe green colour. Some of these pigments \nalso help in photosynthesis. You can use \nan iodine test to check for the presence \nof starch in these leaves, indicating that \nphotosynthesis has indeed taken place. \n \n \nt \nLife Processes in Plants\nWhat do we infer from the observations listed in Table 10.2? \nAs we know, leaves are mostly green because of the presence \nof chlorophyll. We have also seen that the starch is produced \nwhere green patches of the leaf are present. We can infer that \nchlorophyll helps in preparing starch in the presence of sunlight. \nIn fact, it is essential for the preparation of starch. Hence, the \nleaves are also called ‘food factories’ of plants. \nWhat else is essential for the preparation of food in plants? \nLet us ﬁ nd out. \n10.2.2 Role of air in the preparation of food\nActivity 10.4: Let us experiment \n(demonstration activity)\nThe teacher may demonstrate this activity.\nTake a potted green plant and keep it in the \ndark for two to three days to allow it to destarch \n(i.e., lose any stored starch). Then, locate one \nleaf of this plant for this experiment.\nTake a wide-mouthed bottle and pour some \ncaustic soda (sodium hydroxide) into it \n(caustic soda absorbs carbon dioxide from \nthe air). \nCaution — Caustic soda is a strong chemical that can \ncause skin burns; only teachers should handle it.\nInsert half of the destarched leaf into the \nbottle through a split cork, leaving the other \nhalf of the leaf outside, and place the bottle as \nshown in Fig. 10.3a.\nWhile \nreading \ncontributions \nof \nscientists in plant nutrition, my sister \ntold me that air plays a role in the \nprocess of food preparation in plants. \n10.2.2 Role of\nW\ns\nto\np\nWhich gas from the air is \nessential in the process of \nfood preparation in plants? \n(b) Iodine test on the leaf\nFig. 10.3: Testing the role of \nchlorophyll and air\nDestarched \nplant\nSodium \nhydroxide \nsolution\n(a) The set-up\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nPlace the set-up in sunlight for a few hours.\nObserve and record the availability of water, sunlight, \nchlorophyll, and carbon dioxide in Table 10.3.\nRemove the leaf and test it for starch using the iodine test, as \nwas done in Activity 10.2. \nRecord your observations in Table 10.3.\nTable 10.3: Role of air in the preparation of starch by plants\nAvailability of \nPart of the \nleaf inside the \nbottle\nPart of the \nleaf\nPart of the leaf \noutside the \nbottle\nWater\nChlorophyll \nSunlight\nCarbon \ndioxide\nStarch \npresent \n(Yes/No)\nWe notice that the part of the leaf that was outside the bottle \nturns blue-black, indicating the presence of starch. However, the \npart of the leaf inside the bottle does not turn blue-black in colour, \nindicating that food is not made in that part of the leaf. This is \nbecause the caustic soda solution inside the ﬂ ask absorbs the \ncarbon dioxide present in the air. What does this experiment show?\nThis experiment shows that carbon dioxide present in the air \nis essential for plants to prepare starch. \nBased on Activities 10.3 and 10.4, what do you conclude? \nWhich part of the plant is involved in the synthesis of starch?  \nBased on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight, \nwater, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the \nsynthesis of food in plants. This process by which plants prepare \nfood in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called \nphotosynthesis. A leaf is the primary site for photosynthesis.  Do \nother green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, \nother parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform \nphotosynthesis.\nSo far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from \nthe air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the \nprocess of photosynthesis. But have you ever thought about what \nmore happens during this process? Do plants only take in \nLife Processes in Plants\nsubstances from their surroundings, or do they also release \nsomething? Let us explore this through an experiment performed \nby Barkha didi. \nActivity 10.5: Let us explore\nLook at Fig. 10.4. Compare the \ntwo set-ups labelled as A and B, \nand analyse. \nIn Fig. 10.4, set-up A is placed in \nsunlight, and set-up B is placed in \nthe dark. What diﬀ erence do you \nobserve in the two set-ups? Do \nyou observe air bubbles emerging \nin the inverted test tube in set-up \nA? The gas produced in this set-up \ncaused bubbles to emerge and get \naccumulated in the inverted test \ntube. Which gas is this?  \nFig. 10.4: Activity showing the release \nof oxygen during photosynthesis\nB\nBeaker\nInverted \ntest tube\nFunnel \nWater plant\nA\nf\nyg\ng p\nShe inferred that the gas in the test tube is rich in \noxygen. It indicates that oxygen is released during \nthe process of photosynthesis. It also indicates that \nphotosynthesis occurs in the presence of sunlight.\nWhen suﬃ  cient gas was accumulated in the \ninverted test tube, Barkha didi placed her \nthumb on the mouth of the test tube while \ntaking the test tube oﬀ  the set-up. She then \nquickly inserted a lit matchstick into the tube \nand the matchstick produced an intense ﬂ ame. \nOh yes! I remember. In our science lab,  I \nhave seen a similar set-up placed under \nsunlight near a window. \nBased on Barkha didi’s experiment, we can conclude that \noxygen is released during photosynthesis.\nAir bubbles\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n10.2.3 Photosynthesis: in a \nnutshell\nWe know that water, sunlight, carbon \ndioxide from the air, and chlorophyll \nare necessary to carry out the process \nof \nphotosynthesis \nthat \nproduces \ncarbohydrates \n(Fig. \n10.5). \nDuring \nphotosynthesis, \nfood \nis \nactually \nproduced in the form of glucose, a \nsimple carbohydrate. This glucose not \nonly serves as an instant source of \nenergy but also later gets converted into \nstarch for storage. The word equation \nof photosynthesis is given below —\n \n \n \n \n          Sunlight \nCarbon dioxide + Water \n  Glucose + Oxygen\n \n \n \n \n       Chlorophyll\nKNOW A SCIENTIST\nMany scientists across the world contributed to develop an \nunderstanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur \n(1896–1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. \nHe was a plant scientist and served as the head of the \nBotany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, \nBombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from \n1921–1935. He studied eﬀ ects of the amount of water \nand temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the \nimportance of water, temperature, and the colour of \nlight in the process of photosynthesis. \n10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during \nphotosynthesis?\nWe now know that photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, and \noxygen is released in the process. Which part of the plant helps in \nthe exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen? Let us conduct an \nactivity to understand where the exchange of gases takes place.\nFig. 10.5: A diagram showing \nphotosynthesis\nLight energy\nCarbon\ndioxide\nWater and \nminerals\nChlorophyll \npigment\nOxygen\nCarbohydrates\n(Glucose)\nLife Processes in Plants\nActivity 10.6: Let us examine \n(demonstration activity)\nThe teacher may demonstrate this activity.\nCollect a leaf from a plant such as rhoeo, \nmoney plant, onion, hibiscus, coleus, or \nany grass.\nPut it in a beaker ﬁ lled with water.\nCarefully peel a thin layer from the lower \nsurface of the leaf.\nPlace the peel in a watch glass with water.\nNow, take a microscope slide and \ncarefully put a drop of water on it.\nUsing forceps, transfer the peel of the leaf \nfrom the watch glass to the slide with the \nhelp of forceps.\nPut a drop of ink on the leaf peel with the \nhelp of a dropper. \nCover the peel with a coverslip and \nobserve it under a microscope.\nWhat do you observe? Do you notice tiny \npores on the peel, as shown in Fig. 10.6? \nThese pores are called stomata. Stomata, present on the surface \nof leaves, help in the exchange of gases.\n10.3 Transport in Plants \np\n10.3.1 Transport of water and minerals\nAll living beings need water to grow. Plants use water in the \nprocess of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in \nthe soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important \nnutrients for the growth of plants. How do water and minerals \ntaken up by the roots move to all parts of the plant? \nWe can study water transport in plants by carrying out an \nactivity. For this activity, we require two glass tumblers, some \nwater, red ink, and twigs of two similar tender plants, preferably \nwith white-coloured ﬂ owers (for example, white sadabahar, \nbalsam), as shown in Fig. 10.7.\nStomata\nFig. 10.6: Stomata on the lower \nsurface of a rhoeo leaf\n0.1 mm\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nActivity 10.7: Let us experiment\nTake two tumblers and label them A and B. \nFill one-third of each tumbler with water.\nAdd a few drops of red ink to tumbler B.\nObliquely cut the stems of both plants at their \nbase while keeping them inside the water and \nimmediately place one plant in each tumbler, \nas shown in Fig. 10.7a and Fig. 10.7b.\nObserve these plants the next day.\nWhat do you notice? Compare the plant \nstems placed in the tumblers. Do you observe \nred colour in the stem, leaves, and ﬂ owers of the \nplant from Tumbler B? Fig. 10.7c and Fig. 10.7d \nshow the plants after one day. Compare the plant \nin Fig. 10.7c with that in Fig. 10.7d. A red colour \nis visible in the stem, leaves, and ﬂ owers of the \nplant in Fig. 10.7d. How did diﬀ erent parts of the \nplant acquire this red colour? \nCut the stem from the upper part of the plant \nthat is not immersed in the red-coloured water. \nObserve the cut stem using a magnifying glass.  Do \nyou spot the red colour in the stem (Fig. 10.7e)? \nHow does the red colour ink move upwards? This \nis due to the thin tube-like structure called the \nxylem present in the stem, branches, and leaves \nof plants. Just like red ink, minerals dissolved in \nwater also move up the stem through the xylem. \nNow, we know that water and minerals are \ntransported to the leaves and other parts of \nplants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water \ntransported through the xylem is used to perform \nvarious functions. How does food get transported \nto other parts of a plant? \n10.3.2 Transport of food\nWe know that leaves are the primary site for \nphotosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the \nleaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This \nfood is transported through another set of thin \ntube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8). \nThe transported food may also be stored in some \nother parts of a plant, such as seeds and roots.\nA\nB\n(a) With water\n(b) With coloured water\nplant twigs placed in water with different \ntreatments \nA\nB\nplant twigs after one day\n(d) With coloured water\n(c) With water\n(e) Enlarged view of cut end of the twig\nFig. 10.7: Experiment to check for \nwater transportation in plants\nFig. 10.8: Transport of water \nand minerals in a plant\nWater transport \nthrough xylem\nFood transport \nthrough phloem\nCut\nPhloem\nXylem\nLife Processes in Plants\n10.4 Do Plants Respire? \np\nIn the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living \nCreatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, you learnt that all \nliving beings respire. Do plants also respire like we do?\nActivity 10.8: Let us ﬁ nd out\n(demonstration activity)\nSoak some moong bean seeds in water overnight.\nPut a layer of cotton in a conical ﬂ ask (Fig. 10.9) and moisten \nthe cotton with water to keep it wet. \nPlace the soaked seeds over the wet cotton in the conical ﬂ ask. \nCover the mouth of the conical ﬂ ask with \na cork having two holes. \nFit two tubes A and B through the two \nholes on the cork, as shown in Fig. 10.9. \nLeave it undisturbed for 24 hours in \nthe dark.\nTake two test tubes and ﬁ ll them with \nlime water.\nCover the mouth of one test tube with a \ncork having one hole in it.\nDip one glass tube in the test tube \nthrough a hole in the cork.\nConnect the ﬂ ask and test tube with a rubber pipe as shown \nin Fig. 10.9.\nCompare both the test tubes for any change in colour. Does \nthe lime water turn milky in both the test tubes? Why does the \nlime water turn milky in the test tube connected to the ﬂ ask? \nLime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon \ndioxide in the ﬂ ask. But where does this carbon dioxide come \nfrom? As we know, carbon dioxide is naturally present in very \nsmall quantities in the air. In the ﬂ ask, additional carbon dioxide \nis produced by the seeds as they respire. \nDuring respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of \noxygen, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The word \nequation for the proccess of respiration, is as follows — \nGlucose + Oxygen  \n  Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy\nThe energy produced during respiration is used by plants \nfor their growth and development. All parts of a plant, green or \nnon-green, carry out respiration.\nThus, plants have diﬀ erent mechanisms for synthesising, \ntransporting, and utilising food to get energy. \nFig. 10.9: Set-up to test respiration in plants\nTube A\nLime water\nTube B\nGerminating \nseeds \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nIn a Nutshell\nAll living organisms require food that provide energy for \ntheir growth and development.\nPlants use carbon dioxide and water in the presence of \nsunlight and chlorophyll to produce glucose and oxygen. \nThis process of synthesis of food is known as photosynthesis.\nLeaves are the ̒ food factories ̓ of a plant. \nTiny pores on the surface of leaves, called stomata, help \nin the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during \nphotosynthesis and respiration.\nThe xylem transports water and minerals from roots, while \nthe phloem carries food from leaves to all parts of the plants.\nPlants break down glucose and release energy by a process \ncalled respiration.

Having lived in a big city, he ﬁ nds the forests, fresh \nair, sounds of gushing streams, and chirping birds a novel \nexperience.\nHowever, for Keshav, the most fascinating sight is the \ndance of hundreds of ﬁ reﬂ ies at night, ﬂ ashing their lights \nin a wonderful performance. Jatin’s grandparents explain \nthat ﬁ reﬂ ies are seasonal insects and they use light to \ncommunicate. Unfortunately, Keshav also learns the number \nof ﬁ reﬂ ies is decreasing due to light pollution, reduced forest \ncover, and excessive tourism.\nAt the end of their vacation, Keshav and Jatin board an \nevening bus back to their city. As the bus winds through the \nhilly roads, Keshav watches the moonlit landscape and the \nbeams from the headlights of passing vehicles ﬂ ashing by. He \nis reminded of the many poems and songs about moonlight, \nand wonders — does the Moon actually produce its own \nlight? Did we not learn in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the \nGrade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that all other objects in \nour solar system shine only by reﬂ ecting the light of the \nSun? Is moonlight just reﬂ ected sunlight? Which objects give \noﬀ  their own light? While thinking, he notices something \nstrange — light seems to move in a straight line!\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n11.1 Sources of Light\ng\nThe Sun gives out or emits its own light and is the main source \nof natural light on the Earth. Stars, lightning, natural ﬁ re, and \ncertain animals also emit their own light (Fig. 11.1).\nIn ancient times, humans learnt to create \nﬁ re — the earliest form of artiﬁ cial lighting. With \ntime, they learnt to create \nﬁ re using diﬀ erent fuels, \nsuch as animal fat, oil, \nwax, and gas (Fig. 11.2). \nWith the invention of \nelectricity and diﬀ erent \nkinds of electric light \nsources, \nmost \nof \nthe \nlighting needs of humans \nare now met by electric \nlighting (Fig. 11.3).\nObjects that emit their own light are \ncalled luminous objects. Objects that \ndo not emit their own light are called \nnon-luminous objects. The Moon is a \nnon-luminous object. It does not emit its \nown light. It just reﬂ ects the light emitted \nby the Sun that falls on it.\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nLight Emitting Diode (LED) lamps are modern light \nsources that consume much less power, are brighter \nand last longer than traditional lamps. This not \nonly reduces electricity bills but is also better for \nenvironment. Recognising their advantages, the \nIndian government has made substantial eﬀ orts to \npromote the use of LED lamps nationwide. At their \nend of life, LED lamps must be appropriately disposed \nor recycled, and not thrown in the garbage.\na\no\ne\nI\np\ne\no\nFig. 11.3: Some sources of electric light\nob\nobject.

Make sure that all three holes are exactly \nat the same height and are in a line as shown \nin Fig. 11.4.\nPlace a torch light on one side of the matchboxes, ensuring \nthat its lamp is at the height of the holes.\nPlace a cardboard (screen) on the other side of the matchboxes \nand obtain a bright spot on it. (You may need to slightly adjust \nthe heights of boxes.)\nMove one of the matchboxes slightly to a side or up and down. \nAre you able to obtain the light spot on the screen now?\nWhen all the three holes are not in the same line, we could not \nobtain the light spot on the screen. These observations suggest \nthat light travels in a straight line.\nCan we somehow \ncheck it in some \nother way?\nI have an idea. Let us try \nto see the candle ﬂ ame \nthrough a bent pipe! \nShould we also try out this idea? \nActivity 11.2: Let us explore\nCaution — Use a lighted candle under adult supervision \nonly.\nTake a long hollow pipe of some ﬂ exible \nmaterial and align it so that you can see the \ncandle ﬂ ame as shown in Fig. 11.5a.\nNow, bend the pipe and try to see the candle \nﬂ ame again (Fig. 11.5b). Can you still see it? \nYou could see the candle ﬂ ame through a straight \npipe but not through a bent pipe.

Avoid \nusing high-power lasers for this activity; a low-power laser \npointer is suﬃ  cient. Never point the laser beam directly at \nanyone’s eyes, as it can cause serious eye damage.\nPass \na \nlaser \nbeam \nthrough a beaker ﬁ lled with \nwater in which a drop of \nmilk is added to make the \nlaser beam easily visible. \nWhat do you observe? Do you see that the \nbeam of laser light inside water follows a \nstraight path? \nHowever, light can sometimes even bend \naround corners! This is something you will \nlearn in the higher grades.\nDIVE\nEEPER\nLight: Shadows and Reﬂ ections \nFig. 11.6: Passing light \nthrough different materials\nList the materials of the objects in Table 11.1 and classify them \ninto transparent, translucent, and opaque (In the chapter \n‘Materials Around Us’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity\nyou learnt to classify materials into transparent, \ntranslucent, and opaque, depending on how \nyou could see through them).\nGo to a dark room, turn on the torch, and place \nit at such a position that you get a spot of light \nfrom the torch on a wall. Or you may place a \ncardboard screen as shown in Fig. 11.6 and get \nthe spot of light on it. \nWe will now conduct this activity in two \nparts — prediction and observation.\n\nPredict what will happen if you hold an object in front of \nthe light coming out of the torch. Would you continue to \nsee the spot of light on the screen? Note your prediction \nin Table 11.1.\n\nNow, actually place the object between the torch and \nthe screen. Does light pass through the object? Note your \nobservation in Table 11.1.\nRepeat this for all the objects.\nWas your observation the same as your prediction? What \nconclusions could you draw? Light passes almost completely \nthrough transparent materials. Light passes partially through \ntranslucent materials. Light does not pass through opaque\nmaterials.\nWhat happens when an \nopaque object blocks \nthe path of light?\nWha\nopa\nth\n11.4 Shadow Formation\nWhat did you see on the screen in Activity 11.3 when \nan opaque object was placed in the path of light? Did \nyou see a dark patch on the wall? Why was this dark \npatch formed? \nWe now know that light travels in a straight line. \nSo, when an opaque object is placed in its path, light is \nblocked. The dark patch, where light does not reach, \nis the shadow. \nFig. 11.7: Shadows around us\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nWe have noticed shadows of ourselves and other objects \naround us when we are in the Sun or under a light (Fig. 11.7). \nAlso, you might have had fun making diﬀ erent shapes with \nshadows sometime.  \nDo translucent and transparent objects create shadows or not? \nDid you notice that in Activity 11.3? Opaque objects form darker \nshadows. Translucent objects make lighter shadows. Even some \ntransparent objects can create faint shadows!\nLet us learn more about shadows.\nActivity 11.4: Let us explore\nCollect some opaque objects of diﬀ erent shapes and sizes. \nRepeat Activity 11.3, but this time, carry out the actions \nmentioned in the ﬁ rst column of Table 11.2.\nObserve the shape and size of the shadow on the screen for \neach of the actions. \nDid the shadow form in all cases? Was the shape and size of the \nshadow the same as the object?\nRecord your observations in the second column of Table 11.2.\nTable 11.2: Observation of shadows\nAction\nObservations regarding \nshadow\nThe screen is removed.\nThe object is removed.\nThe torch is switched oﬀ .\nThe colour of the object is changed.\nThe object is moved closer to the screen, \nkeeping the torch and the screen ﬁ xed.\nThe object is moved closer to the torch, \nkeeping the torch and the screen ﬁ xed.\nThe object is tilted, keeping the torch and \nthe screen ﬁ xed.\nWhat conclusions do you draw from this activity? What do \nwe need to observe a shadow? Does the colour of the shadow \nchange when the colour of the object is changed?\nShadows are formed when an object blocks light from falling on \na screen. We need a source of light, an opaque object, and a screen \nLight: Shadows and Reﬂ ections \nto observe a shadow. The walls, ﬂ oor, ground, or any other surface \nacts as a screen for observing shadows in our daily life.\nThe shape, size, and sharpness of the shadow depend on the \nposition of the object relative to the light source and the screen. \nThe shadows may give information about the object or we may \nnot be able to guess the object at all. Changing the colour of \nopaque objects does not change the colour of the shadows.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nShadow play, or shadow puppetry, \nhas been a part of our cultural \nheritage for centuries. In this art \nform, ﬂ at cut-out ﬁ gures called \nshadow puppets are placed between \na light source and a screen. By \nmoving the puppets and the light, \npuppeteers \ncan \ncreate \nlife-like \nmovements, bringing the characters \nto life. Diﬀ erent regions have their \nown unique styles, like the Charma \nBahuli Natya in Maharashtra, Keelu \nBomme and Tholu Bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, Togalu Gombeyaata\nin Karnataka, Ravana Chhaya in Odisha, Tholpavakoothu in Kerala, and \nBommalattam in Tamil Nadu. These are used not only for entertainment \nbut also communicate important messages to the community.\n11.5 Reﬂ ection of Light\ng\nWhen the opaque object was a shiny object like a \npolished steel plate, I got a shadow on the screen, \nbut I also saw that there was a bright spot of light \non the wall on the opposite side. Why was it so?\nActivity 11.5: Let us investigate\nFind a shiny ﬂ at steel plate or a plane mirror, that is, a mirror \nthat is ﬂ at and not curved. \nTake it outside and let the sunlight fall on the shiny surface. \nWhat can you do to redirect light on the wall on which the \nsunlight is not falling directly?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nWhat conclusion do you draw from your observations? This \nactivity suggests that a shiny surface or a mirror changes the \ndirection of light that falls upon it. This change in direction of \nlight by a mirror is called the reﬂ ection of light. Let us try to \nunderstand the reﬂ ection of light by a mirror.\nActivity 11.6: Let us experiment\nFig. 11.8: Using mirror to redirect \nsunlight on a wall\nTurn the shiny plate or mirror in \ndiﬀ erent directions to redirect the \nlight onto a wall or a nearby surface \n(Fig. 11.8). Do you see a spot of light \non the wall? Does it mean that the \nshiny plate or mirror has changed \nthe direction of light?\nNow, tilt the shiny plate or mirror \nin diﬀ erent ways and observe \nthe light spot on the wall. Does it \nchange position? Notice how light \nalways travels in straight lines and \nchanges direction when it falls on \nthe shiny plate or mirror.\nTake a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a comb, \na sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper.\nUsing the black paper, close all openings of the \ncomb, except for one to make a thin slit. \nSpread a white paper on a table, hold the comb \nperpendicular to the sheet of paper and shine \nthe torch light on the slit. Adjust the comb and \ntorch slightly till you see a thin beam of light \nalong the paper which has passed through the \nslit (Fig. 11.9a).\nNow, place the mirror in the path of the light \nbeam while keeping the comb steady (Fig. 11.9b). \nWhat do you observe?\nThe path of the light beam is changed after falling \non the mirror. The reﬂ ection of light occurs at the \nmirror.\nmirror.\nIn a mirror, I can also see my \nface. Is that also due to the \nreﬂ ection of light?\n(a)\nFig. 11.9: (a) A light beam (b) Reﬂ ection \nof light in a plane mirror\n(b)\nThin slit\nPlane mirror\nLight: Shadows and Reﬂ ections \n11.6 Images Formed in a Plane Mirror\ng\nLook into the mirror. Do you see your face in it? What you see is \na reﬂ ection of your face in the mirror. We also see reﬂ ections of \nother objects that are in front of the mirror. Let us try to ﬁ nd out \nmore about this.\nActivity 11.7: Let us experiment\nTake a plane mirror and a pen or some other object.\nPlace the pen in front of the mirror as shown in \nFig. 11.10.\nWhat do you see in the mirror? It appears as if a similar \npen is placed behind the mirror. The pen which appears \nbehind the mirror is the image of the pen formed by the \nmirror. The pen itself is the object.\nNow, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the \nmirror and compare the sizes of the images of the pen at \neach position. \nAre the two sizes the same? The image formed by a plane \nmirror is of the same size as the object.\nAgain, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the \nmirror and observe if the image is upright at each position. \nDoes the tip of the pen appear on top at each position? An \nupright image is called erect. An image formed by a plane mirror \nis erect.\nNow, place a screen vertically behind the mirror. Move it \naround. Do you get the image on the screen? Repeat this by \nplacing the screen in front of the mirror.\nThe image formed by a plane mirror cannot be obtained on \na screen.\nActivity 11.8: Let us experiment\nStand in front of a plane mirror and look at your image \n(Fig. 11.11). Notice how far it appears to be from the mirror.\nNow, stand close to the mirror. Is the image also closer to the \nmirror?\nStand at diﬀ erent distances from the mirror and notice how \nfar the image appears to be from the mirror in each case. \nDo you ﬁ nd any relation between your distance from the \nmirror and the distance of your image from the mirror?\nFig. 11.10: Image of a pen \nin a plane mirror\nFig. 11.11: Observing one’s \nown image in a mirror\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nYou might have noticed that when you stand close to the \nplane mirror, the image also appears to be close to the mirror. \nThe image appears to be far from the mirror when you stand far \nfrom the plane mirror.\nRaise your left arm. Which arm does your image raise?\nTouch your right ear. Which ear does your image touch?\nYou ﬁ nd that your left appears right in your image and your \nright appears left in your image. This type of perceived left-right \nreversal is called lateral inversion. There is lateral inversion in \nthe images formed by a plane mirror.\nOh!

Since there are 3 mirrors, and multiple images (due to \nreﬂ ections of reﬂ ections), many interesting patterns are formed. \nDesigners and artists often use kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new \npatterns.\nIn a Nutshell\nObjects that emit their own light are called luminous objects.\nLight travels in a straight line.\nLight passes almost completely through transparent \nmaterials.

She was excited. That was \nthe day her science teacher had dedicated a class for students to \nshare and try to explain interesting observations.\nRashmika had been noticing that the coconut tree shadows \nwere long in the morning but shorter in the afternoon on her \nway back. She thought about it and decided that the size of the \nshadows changed because the Sun moved across the sky during \nthe day. But she also remembered learning that the Earth moved \naround the Sun (in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science \ntextbook Curiosity) so she was puzzled. She wondered — does the \nSun move in the sky? Or does the Earth move?\nCuriosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7\n12.1 Rotation of the Earth\nYou might have also noticed that the Sun rises in the East and sets in \nthe West. Have you ever wondered why? Let us try to understand \nwhy. Have you ever enjoyed riding a merry-go-round at a park or \nat your school? Let us go back to riding a merry-go-round!\nActivity 12.1: Let us explore\nSit on a merry-go-round facing towards the outer side as \nshown in Fig. 12.1.\nFig. 12.1: A girl observing objects around \nher while riding a merry-go-round\nAsk someone to turn the merry-go-\nround slowly in the anti-clockwise \ndirection as shown in Fig. 12.1. While \nyou are sitting on the moving merry-\ngo-round, look around you. Do the \nobjects around you appear to be \nmoving? In which direction do they \nappear to be moving? \nWhile you turn in the anti-clockwise \ndirection, the objects appear to turn \naround you in the opposite direction, that \nis, in the clockwise direction.\nNow ﬁ x your gaze at a particular tree \n(or a building) ahead of you while \nsitting on the merry- go-round turning \naround in anti-clockwise direction.\nIn which direction do you ﬁ nd the tree turning around you? Is \nit in your view all the time?\nThe tree appears to turn around you in the opposite direction, \nthat is, the clockwise direction. The tree appears in your view \nfrom your left-hand side and then moves out of your view on the \nright-hand side when you view it from a merry-go-round turning \naround in anti-clockwise direction.\nUsing the observations made by us while riding a merry-go-\nround, let us now think. When we view from the Earth, the Sun \nappears in the East, moves across the sky from the East to the West \nand disappears in the West. Does it indicate that the Sun is moving \nin the sky? Or might it be that the Earth itself is turning around \nand the Sun just appears to move?\nThe fact is that the Sun appears to be moving because we view \nit from the Earth, which is turning around itself. \nEarth, Moon, and the Sun\nIn which way is the Earth turning around itself? To visualise \nthis, let us recall some of the objects which turn around themselves. \nHave you watched a top spinning around its spindle (Fig. 12.2a)? \nOr a spinning fan (Fig. 12.2b)?

The Earth \ncompletes one rotation in about 24 hours.\nWhen viewed from the top of the North Pole \n(Fig. 12.3), the Earth is rotating in the anti-clockwise \ndirection, that is, from West to East.\nLet us try to understand this with the help of a \nglobe. You have used a globe in Grade 6 to represent \nthe Earth and identiﬁ ed North Pole, South Pole, and \nEquator on it. You also learnt that its axis passed \nthrough its North and South poles (in the Grade 6 Social \nScience textbook Exploring Society India and Beyond).\nActivity 12.2: Let us explore\nUse a globe to represent the Earth and place a small \nsticker to mark your location on it (Fig. 12.4a). \nWhile viewing from above the North Pole, slowly \nrotate the globe on its axis in anti-clockwise \ndirection. \nObserve how your location turns around \nand ﬁ nally comes back to its original position \ncompleting one rotation.\nRotation is the motion of an object \nin which all its parts move in circles \naround an imaginary line that passes \nthrough it.

Do you notice how half \nof the globe receives the light from \nthe torch, while the other half stays \ndark? \nIt is day time in that half of the globe \nwhich receives light, and night time in \nthe other half.\nIn India, sunrise ﬁ rst occurs in \nthe eastern part and then in other \nparts. While looking at the eastern part of India on the globe, \nrotate the globe in one direction and then in the opposite \ndirection. What is the direction of rotation when light falls on \nthe eastern part of India ﬁ rst? \nThe light falls on the eastern part of India ﬁ rst when the globe \nrotates from West to East with respect to the North-South axis of \nthe globe. \nNow while rotating the globe from West to East, observe your \nlocation on the Earth. Does it go through a cycle of day and \nnight?\nSunrise occurs as your location moves into light and sunset \noccurs as it moves into darkness.\nThe Earth’s rotation from West to East causes the day-night \ncycle.

In the middle of \nnineteenth \ncentury, \nanother \nscientist, \nLeon \nFoucault, used a long pendulum to give the ﬁ rst \nsimple demonstration of the Earth’s rotation. The \npendulum, known as a Foucault pendulum in his \nhonour, consists of a long string with a heavy bob, \nsuspended from a high ceiling.\nA Foucault pendulum with a length of 22 metres \nhas been hung from a skylight in the Constitution \nHall of the new Parliament building in New Delhi, \nIndia. It symbolises the integration of the idea of \nIndia with the vastness of the cosmos.\np\nho\nsu\nha\nHa\nIn\nIn\nCuriosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7\nYes, indeed! Let us look at the \nstars in the night sky to see the \neﬀ ect of Earth’s rotation.\nActivity 12.3: Let us explore\nOn an early evening between March and May, identify the \nBig Dipper (Saptarishi), and the Pole Star (Dhruva Tara), if \nvisible, as you did in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 \nScience textbook Curiosity.\nNote down your location and date \nof your night sky observations. \nThe activity must be carried out \non the same night.\nDraw the orientation of the Big \nDipper in the sky with respect \nto the Pole Star (or a ﬁ xed \ntree/building on the ground \nin a direction towards the Big \nDipper if you cannot see the \nPole Star). Mark the time of your \nobservation along with your \nsketch as shown in Fig. 12.7. \nAfter two hours, observe the Big Dipper again. Has it moved? \nAgain, draw its orientation and note down the time.\nRepeat the above step after two hours. Do you observe that \nthe Big Dipper appears to move around the Pole Star (notice \njust the movement even if you cannot see the Pole Star)? \nThe Earth’s axis of rotation points very close to the Pole Star in \nthe Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Pole Star appears nearly \nstationary in the sky from the Earth. All the stars appear to move \naround it. Just like the Sun, the Moon also appears to rise in the \neastward direction and set in the westward direction because the \nEarth rotates from West to East.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nAstrophotographers take long exposure \nphotographs, keeping the camera’s \nshutter open for a long time. In such \na photograph, the apparent motion of \nthe stars is recorded as arcs of a circle, \nknown as star trails. \n(Picture taken from Mahuli, Maharashtra)\na’s \nch\nof \ne,\nFig. 12.7: Illustrative sketch of Big Dipper (for activity 12.3) \nby a student located in Pune on the night of 1–2 April\n3 AM\n5 AM\n1 AM\n11 PM\n9 PM\n7 PM\nNortheast\nNorth\nNorthwest\nSince the Earth is rotating, \nshouldn’t the stars also \nappear to move in the sky \nlike the Sun?\nEarth, Moon, and the Sun\nFASCINATING FACTS\nAncient Indian astronomers, including Aryabhata, had also \nnoticed the daily apparent motion of the celestial objects, such \nas the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. Aryabhata was a famous \nmathematician and astronomer of ancient India who wrote an \nimportant treatise, Aryabhatiya, around the ﬁ fth century CE. The \napparent motion of the stars due to the rotation of the Earth is \nexplained in Verse 9, Golapada, Aryabhatiya.\n¥ÙéÜæð×»çÌÙæñüSÍÑ ÂàØˆØ¿Ü¢ çßÜæð×»¢ ØmÌ÷ïÐ\n¥¿ÜæçÙ ÖæçÙ ÌmÌ÷ï â×Âçp×»æçÙ ÜVæØæ×÷ïH\nJust as a man in a boat moving forward sees stationary objects as \nmoving backwards, so also the stars that are stationary are seen \nby people of Lanka as moving towards the west.\nAryabhata’s stated value for the time taken by the Earth to \ncomplete one full rotation about its axis is around 23 hours 56 \nminutes 4.1 seconds (in modern units). This value is impressively \nclose to the currently accepted value.\nI have seen that the stars and \nconstellations that appear in the \nEast at sunset change during \ndiﬀ erent months.\nYes. Maybe that is why we were told to \nlook for certain stars and constellations at \ncertain times of the year in Grade 6. But, \nwhy do diﬀ erent stars appear in the night \nsky over the course of a year?\n12.2 Revolution of the Earth\nWhile rotating on its own axis, the Earth also revolves around the Sun \nas we learnt in Grade 6. This movement is diﬀ erent from rotation. \nRevolution is the motion of an object around another object. \nCuriosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7\nThe path an object takes while revolving around another object \nis called its orbit. If viewed from the top (Fig. 12.8), the orbit of the \nEarth around the Sun is nearly circular. (In the ﬁ gure of the Solar \nSystem given in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science \ntextbook Curiosity, the orbit appeared elongated because it was \na side view of the orbit). The Earth completes one revolution\naround the Sun in about 365 days and 6 hours.\n12.2.1 Changing view of night sky from the Earth\nEvery evening the Sun sets in the westward direction and the night \nsky becomes visible. We know that this occurs due to the Earth’s \nrotation. As the Earth also revolves around the Sun continuously, \nthe stars seen in the night sky after sunset gradually change over \na year as we look in diﬀ erent directions, as shown in Fig. 12.8. \nFig. 12.8: Revolution of the Earth around the Sun leads to \nchanging view of the night sky throughout the year \n(The sizes and distances are not to scale)\nMarch\nStars that  \nrise at \nsunset\nStars that \nset at \nsunrise\nDifferent stars \nrise at sunset in \ndifferent months\nJune\nDecember\nSeptember\nSun\nYou can also notice this change by looking at the pattern of \nstars (such as those that you learnt about in Grade 6), at a ﬁ xed \ntime of the night, on days separated by a month. \nFASCINATING FACTS\nThe Bhil and Pawara are indigenous communities from the Tapi Valley \nin western India, who used the appearance of certain patterns of stars \nin the sky as markers for the arrival of monsoon rain.\nEarth, Moon, and the Sun\n12.2.2 Seasons on the Earth\nI have noticed that we go \nthrough a cycle of seasons \nevery year. Is it related to \nthe revolution of the Earth \naround the Sun in some \nway?\nI have also noticed \nthat days are longer \nin summer than in \nwinter.\nThe Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the \norbit, but is tilted. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits around \nthe Sun (Fig. 12.9). The tilt of the Earth’s axis and the spherical \nshape of the Earth gives rise to seasons. Let us ﬁ nd out, how.\nFig. 12.9: Different positions of the Earth while revolving around the Sun \n(The Earth’s orbit appears elongated because this is a side view and not the \ntop view.

So that area is heated more.\nFurther, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight for more \nthan 12 hours in June (Fig. 12.11a). So, the Northern Hemisphere \nexperiences more intense sunlight, which lasts for a longer time, \ncausing the summer season. In December, the situation is opposite \nin the Northern Hemisphere and it experiences winter season \nwith sunlight for shorter time (Fig. 12.10b and Fig. 12.11b).\nCuriosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7\nFig. 12.10: (a) More intense sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere and less intense sunlight \nin the Southern Hemisphere in June (b) The opposite situation happens in December.\nSame amount of \nsunrays are spread in \na smaller area in this \nhemisphere, hence are \nmore intense. \nSame amount of \nsunrays are spread in \na larger area in this \nhemisphere, hence \nare less intense. \nJune\nDecember\nNorth Pole\nNorth Pole\n(a)\n(b)\nSunrays\nFig. 12.11: In the Northern Hemisphere (a) Longer daytime in June\n(b) Shorter daytime in December\nPlaces in this hemisphere \nreceive sunlight for\nmore than 12 hours \nduring the 24 hour\nrotation of the Earth.\nThe North Pole receives sunlight for\nall 24 hours in June\nThe North Pole is in darkness for\n all 24 hours in December\nPlaces in this hemisphere \nare in darkness for\nmore than 12 hours \nduring the 24 hour\nrotation of the Earth.\nJune\nDecember\n(a)\n(b)\nThe seasons and length of daytime are reversed in the \nSouthern Hemisphere as compared to the Northern Hemisphere. \nThere, it is winter in June and summer in December (Fig. 12.10 \nand Fig. 12.11). \nTwo incorrect reasons often given to explain why seasons occur \non the Earth are:\nWhen the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, it is \ncloser to the Sun.\nThe orbit of the Earth is an oval with the Sun slightly displaced \nfrom its centre so the Earth is at diﬀ erent distances from the \nSun over the year.\nHowever, the diﬀ erence in distances in either of these cases is \nvery small and these are not the reasons why seasons occur on \nthe Earth. In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January.\nDIVE\nEEPER\no\n\n\nH\nDIVE\nEEPER\nSunrays\nEarth, Moon, and the Sun\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the longest day occurs around \n21 June—this is known as summer solstice. After the summer \nsolstice, the duration of a day becomes shorter while that of a \nnight becomes longer. The shortest day and longest night in this \nHemisphere occur around 22 December known as the winter \nsolstice. Around 21 March and 23 September, the daytime lasts \nfor 12 hours. In the Northern Hemisphere, these days are called \nthe spring and the autumn equinox, respectively.\nDIVE\nEEPER\nFASCINATING FACTS\nAt the North Pole, the Sun rises in the East direction on the equinox \nday — 21 March, and remains continuously in the sky for six months. \nThe Sun sets on 22 September. The South Pole experiences the opposite \nbehaviour. The polar regions thus experience continuous sunshine for \nsix months followed by a six-month period of darkness.\nF\nA\nd\nT\nb\ns\nOn the equator, there is always 12 hours of sunlight and 12 \nhours of darkness. There is little diﬀ erence in the intensity of the \nsunrays falling on the equator in diﬀ erent months. Thus, for the \nsouthern states of India that lie close to the equator, the eﬀ ect \nof seasons is not very prominent. Other eﬀ ects, such as local \ngeographical features and proximity to oceans or seas, can also \ninﬂ uence these broader patterns seen in the two hemispheres, as \nyou have learnt in social science. \n12.3 Eclipses\np\nDay and night cycle, seasons, the life \non the Earth... so much is dependent \nupon the Sun. Could the light from the \nSun get blocked by the two planets\nwhich are revolving between the \nEarth and the Sun?\nThe planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to \nthe Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching \nus. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can \ndo that. Do you remember studying in Grade 6 that the Moon is a \nnatural satellite of the Earth and it revolves around the Earth as \nthe Earth revolves around the Sun? \nCuriosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7\n12.3.1 Solar eclipse\nAt certain times, the Moon can come in between the Sun and the \nEarth in a way that obstructs the light from the Sun from reaching \nus. This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the \nMoon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from \nthe Sun that we see in the sky. \nActivity 12.4: Let us explore\nAsk your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about \n5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun.\nNow close one eye and show a thumbs up with your \noutstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. \nAre you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your \nthumb?\nYou can cover the entire head of your friend \nwith the help of your thumb, even though your \nthumb is much smaller than the actual size of \nyour friend’s head. How could it be? The size of \nany object as seen by your eye — also known as \napparent size — depends upon both its actual \nphysical size and its distance from you. The \nthumb being much closer to you as compared to \nyour friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and \nyour friend’s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 \nare similar.\nThe apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are \nsimilar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though \nthe Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon \nis much closer to us compared to the Sun. Therefore, the Moon \ncan appear to cover the entire Sun as viewed from the Earth.\nThough the planets Mercury and Venus are much larger than \nthe Moon in size, they are also much farther from the Earth as \ncompared to the Moon. Thus, their apparent sizes are very much \nsmaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example, \nwhen Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as \na tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This \nevent, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.\nDIVE\nEEPER\nth\nco\nsm\nwh\na \nev\nDIVE\nEEPER\nFigure 12.13 shows the arrangement of the Sun, the Moon, and \nthe Earth during a solar eclipse.

The observers in this area witness a total solar eclipse \n(Fig. 12.14a).\nFig. 12.12: Trying to cover a \nfriend’s head with the thumb\nFig 12 12: Trying to cover a\nEarth, Moon, and the Sun\nEarth’s orbit\nPartial \nsolar eclipse\nMoon\nSun\nTotal solar \neclipse\nMoon’s \norbit\nFig. 12.13: Geometry of solar eclipse \n(The sizes and distances are not to scale)\nIn areas where the Moon partially blocks out only some \nregions of the Sun, the observers see a partial solar eclipse \n(Fig. 12.13 and Fig. 12.14b). \nDuring a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark \nduring the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the \nEarth’s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the \nMoon’s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the \ntotal solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes. As the Moon \nbegins to move away from the front of the Sun (Fig. 12.14c), we \nsee a partial solar eclipse and daylight begins to return.\nSafe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse\nCaution— During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the \nSun, thinking that it wouldn’t be strong enough to cause harm to our \neyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to \ndamage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar \neclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses, \nbinoculars, or telescopes.\nUsually, \nastronomy \norganisations, such as planetaria \nand astronomy clubs hold eclipse \nviewing events during a solar \neclipse (Fig. 12.15). \nParticipating in such events \nis the best way to observe a solar \neclipse since the organisers not \nonly provide specialised eye \nprotection for solar viewing, but \nalso oﬀ er scientiﬁ c explanations.\n(a) Total solar eclipse \n(c) A ‘diamond ring’ seen \nafter a total solar eclipse, \njust when the Moon starts \nto move away\nFig. 12.14: Solar eclipse\n(b) Partial solar eclipse\nFig. 12.15: A public solar eclipse \nviewing organised in Ooty, Tamil Nadu \nBall with \nmirror\nScreen with the \nSun’s image\nCuriosity  Textbook of Science  Grade 7\nThis activity, similar to Activity 11.5, is to be set up by your \nteacher.

To solve this, make \na movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small \nhole, half-ﬁ ll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small \nmirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it. Place the ball on \na circular ring, like an adhesive tape ring, so it can be turned \naround easily. Adjust it until the Sun’s image appears on a \nwall or screen. Fig.  12.15 shows this set-up where the mirror \nis ﬁ xed to a green ball.\nCaution — This activity should be performed strictly under \nsupervision of a teacher.

When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they \nfeared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something \nblocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, \neven for a brief period of time, would have been extremely \nconcerning. Many superstitions were attached to solar eclipses in \nvarious parts of the world related to the activities that could not \nbe carried out during eclipses—such as eating, cooking, or going \nout of home. But now that we know the reason why a solar eclipse \noccurs, we need not fear these events as long as we do not look at \nthe Sun directly. In fact, scientists go around the world to observe \nthe eclipses from wherever these are observable. The eclipses \nprovide them an opportunity to study phenomena that cannot be \nobserved otherwise.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nAn eclipse is known as grahan in Sanskrit and in many Indian languages. \nMany ancient Indian astronomical texts provide calculations to \npredict eclipses. The best known and most referred text is the Surya\nSiddhanta, which is written in the classical Sanskrit poetry tradition \nin rhythmic shlokas.\n12.3.2 Lunar eclipse\nAs the Moon revolves around the Earth, sometimes the Earth can \nblock the sunlight from reaching the Moon. This is known as a \nlunar eclipse. On such days, we see the Earth’s shadow falling on \nthe full disc of the Moon. Fig. 12.16 shows the arrangement of the \nSun, the Earth, and the Moon during a lunar eclipse. \nEarth, Moon, and the Sun\nFig. 12.16: Geometry of lunar eclipse\n(The sizes and distances are not to scale in the ﬁ gure)\nSun\nMoon’s orbit\nEarth\nPartial lunar\neclipse\nMoon\nTotal \nlunar\neclipse\nPartial lunar\neclipse\nEarth’s orbit\nWhen the Moon is completely in the Earth’s shadow, it is \ncalled a total lunar eclipse. The bright disc of the Moon starts \nto appear dark red in colour and stays that way until the Moon \nmoves out of the shadow of the Earth. When part of the Moon \nis in the Earth’s shadow and the rest of the Moon is visible, it \nis called a partial lunar eclipse. Unlike the Sun, we can safely \nwatch the eclipsed full Moon with our naked eye. \nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nUsing the computer version of Stellarium app, which is free, you may \nget information about the upcoming solar and lunar eclipses (if any) \nwhich may be visible from your location.\ny\n) \nFASCINATING FACTS\nThe \nKodaikanal \nSolar \nObservatory \nis \nlocated \nin \nthe beautiful Palani range of \nhills in southern India.

At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and \nKeerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were \ncurious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them!\nA few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid \non these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets \nsprayed. To their surprise, the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful \nWorld of Science’ appeared on the papers the moment the liquid \nwas sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how \nthis happened and the reason behind it.\nTheir curiosity was partly satisﬁ ed at the ‘Colourful World \nof Substances’ stall. They saw many activities showing colour \nchanges on mixing diﬀ erent substances. They decided to explore \nthese changes further. Let us join them on this learning adventure.\nFig. 2.1: Scene of a science fair\nExploring \nSubstances: Acidic, \nBasic, and Neutral\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n2.1 Nature — Our Science Laboratory\n2.1.1 Litmus as an indicator\nActivity 2.1: Let us explore\nCollect samples of lemon juice, soap solution, amla juice, \ntamarind water, vinegar, baking soda solution, lime water, \ntap water, washing powder solution, sugar solution, and salt \nsolution.\nFig. 2.2(a): Colour change in \nblue litmus paper\nFig. 2.2(b): Colour change in \nred litmus paper\nTake a strip of blue litmus paper \nand cut it into small pieces.\nSpread these pieces on a clean \nand dry white tile.\nUsing a dropper, put one drop of \neach of the samples, one-by-one, \non these litmus paper pieces, as \nshown in Fig. 2.2a.\nDo you observe any change \nin the colour of the blue \nlitmus pieces?\nRecord your observations \nin Table 2.1.\nRepeat the same activity \nwith pieces of red litmus \npaper \nas \nshown \nin \nFig.  2.2b and record your \nobservations in Table 2.1.\nHow to prepare lime water?\nDo not confuse lime water with the word lime, which is a fruit \nsimilar to lemon.\nLime water (solution of calcium hydroxide in water) can be \neasily prepared by mixing lime (chuna, i.e. calcium oxide) in water \nand leaving it undisturbed for some time, say an hour.

It is \navailable  both as a solution and in the form of paper strips, \nknown as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two \ncolours—blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3. \nSubstances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in \nnature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic\nin nature. Since litmus shows diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic \nsolutions, it is called an acid-base indicator.\nSome other substances, both natural and synthetic, can \nalso be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in \nlaboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher \ngrades.\nHOLISTIC LENS\nLichens are formed by the association of two \nliving organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow \non rocks and trees in regions that have abundant \nrainfall and clean air. Do you ﬁ nd lichens on trees \nin your neighbourhood?\nLichens\nNow, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B, \nand Group C in Table 2.2.\nThe substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice, \ntamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to \nred, implying that these substances are acidic in nature. \nThe substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking \nsoda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution \nturned the red litmus paper to blue. Hence, these substances \nare basic in nature. \nThe substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, \nand salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus \npaper. Can you predict their nature?\nThese substances are said to be neutral because they are \nneither acidic nor basic.\nI am curious to know — what are these \nred and blue litmus paper strips made of? \nWhy do they change colour when drops \nof some samples are put on them?\nFig. 2.3: Blue and red litmus \npaper strips\n Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral\nNow, I can check \nthe nature of ﬂ oor \ncleaning liquid using \nan indicator! \nActivity 2.2: Let us relate and explore\nAre all the substances in Group A of Table 2.2 edible? Have you \never tasted these edible substances? Can you recall their taste? \nYou will ﬁ nd that all these substances taste sour. Thus, we can \nsay that substances that taste sour tend to contain acids and are \nacidic in nature.\nCaution — Do not taste anything until asked to do so. Do not taste any \nunknown substance.\nSome common edible substances and the names of the most \ncommon acids present in them are given in Fig. 2.4.\nTartaric acid\nAscorbic acid (Vitamin C) \nand Citric acid\nCitric acid and Oxalic acid\nCitric acid\nFig. 2.4: The most common acids present in some edible substances\nFind out and write the names of the most common acids \npresent in the following substances —\nLemon________, Curd________, Tamarind________, Vinegar________.\nNow, let us take one of the substances — baking soda \nsolution — from Group B. Rub the baking soda solution between \nyour ﬁ ngers. What do you observe? \nIt feels soapy or slippery. Basic substances are generally \nslippery to touch.\nAlso, bases generally taste bitter, but \neverything that tastes bitter may not \ncontain a base. For example, bitter gourd \n(karela) possesses a bitter taste but is not \nbasic in nature.\nIf litmus is not available, are there \nsome other natural substances \nthat \ncan \nserve \nas \nacid-base \nindicators?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n2.1.2 Red rose as an indicator\nYou might have observed many coloured ﬂ owers in your \nsurroundings.

(Group B, Table 2.2)\nAre the samples that do not change the colour of the ﬂ ower \nextract the same as those that did not change the colour of \nred and blue litmus papers? (Group C, Table 2.2)\nFrom the above activity, we can conclude that the red rose \nextract can also be used to test the nature of the substances; \nhence, it is another example of an acid-base indicator. We can \nconclude that the red rose extract seems to give red colour in an \nacidic solution and green colour in a basic solution.\nCan you now ﬁ ll in the nature of the substances in Table 2.3?\nAdd \n20 – 30 \ndrops \nof \nlemon juice in test tube A \nand 20 – 30 drops of soap \nsolution in test tube B with \nthe help of droppers. \nObserve and record any \ncolour changes (Fig. 2.8) to \nthe extract in Table 2.3. \nRepeat the same with the \nother \nsamples \nused \nin \nActivity 2.1 and record your \nobservations in Table 2.3.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nWe are sure that you will be excited about the above results. \nYou may repeat the process of preparing the extract and testing \nsubstances with some vegetables, fruits, or ﬂ owers, such as \nbeetroot, purple cabbage, turmeric, Indian blackberry (jamun), \nand red hibiscus (gudhal) ﬂ ower. They can also act as acid-base \nindicators.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nHydrangea is a plant that \ngrows in cooler climates in \nthe Himalayan region and the \nNorth-eastern states. It gives \nﬂ owers of diﬀ erent colours, \ndepending on the nature of the \nsoil. Acidic soil produces blue-\ncoloured \nﬂ owers, \nwhereas \nin basic soil, the ﬂ owers are \npink or red.

Ray) is known as the \n‘Father of Modern Indian Chemistry’. He earned a doctorate \nin chemistry from the United Kingdom and returned to \nIndia. He contributed towards advancing \nscientiﬁ c research in India. He also \nestablished India’s ﬁ rst pharmaceutical \ncompany (a  company in the ﬁ eld of \nmedicines) in 1901. He was a person rooted \nin Indian culture and knowledge traditions. \nThrough his writings on the history of \nchemistry in India, he highlighted the \nachievements and expertise of ancient \nIndian scientists to the modern world. Ray, a social reformer, \nalso advocated the use of the mother tongue as a medium of \ninstruction in educational institutions.\nf\nf\n2.2  What Happens When Acidic Substances \nMix with Basic Substances?\nLet us investigate by performing the following experiment.\nActivity 2.7: Let us experiment\nTake one drop of lemon juice in a test tube and \nadd around twenty drops of water to it. Observe \nthe colour.\nAdd a drop of blue litmus solution to it.\nDo you observe any colour change (Fig. 2.10a)?\nSlowly add drops of lime water to this test tube with \nthe help of a dropper and swirl it well. \nWhat do you observe? Is there any change in the \ncolour of the solution?\nA stage comes when the colour of the solution \nchanges from red to blue (Fig. 2.10b).\nAgain, add one drop of lemon juice to the above \nsolution.\nCan you predict why there is a change in colour?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nInitially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the \nlemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When \nlime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution \neventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution \nin the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised \nthe eﬀ ect of the acid.\nWhen the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a \nbase in suﬃ  cient quantity, we ﬁ nd that the resulting solution is \nneither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation\nreactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed \nwith the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. \nAcid + Base →Salt + Water + Heat\nThere are many examples in everyday life where you can \nobserve the use of neutralisation processes.\nLet us ﬁ nd out!\n  2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life\ny\nSituation 1: Keerthi was observing a butterﬂ y in \nthe garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk. \nSuddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red \nwith stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped \nher by applying moist baking soda to the aﬀ ected \narea, which relieved the pain. What do you think \nmight be the reason for this? \nWhen an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid \n(formic acid) into the skin. The eﬀ ect of the acid \ncan be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda, \nwhich is a base.\nWhat remedies do people use to treat ant bites \nin your region? \nSituation 2: On the Farmer’s Portal (an \nonline platform from the Department of \nAgriculture, Cooperation and Farmers \nWelfare), a query from a farmer states, “My \nplants are not growing well lately”. After \na detailed discussion, it was found that \nthe excessive use of chemical fertilisers \n(substances added to soil to help plants \ngrow better) made the soil acidic.

They also looked forward to the free 13 kilometre- \ntrain ride from Nangal in Punjab to Bhakra in Himachal Pradesh, \nalong the beautiful Sutlej river and through the Shivalik hills.\nPrior to the trip, Nihal and his classmates were given a group \nassignment to prepare a presentation on the uses of electricity. \nThey began by looking around their houses, then their school, \nfollowed by their neighbourhood, their city, and ﬁ nally they \nsearched the internet.

You have learnt earlier that electricity is \ngenerated in multiple ways — by windmills, by using wind \nenergy, by solar panels capturing the Sun’s energy, by falling \nwater and by using natural gas or coal (in the chapter ‘Nature’s \nTreasures’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity). The electric \nsupply from these sources reaches our homes and factories via \nwires. For example, at home we plug in various devices to the \nelectrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity, \nwe will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us \nmay have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like \na torchlight.\nCaution — The danger signs on electric poles and \nother appliances warn people that electricity can \nbe dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever \nperform experiments with power supply at your \nhome or school. Even electricity from portable \ngenerators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or \ncells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or \nremotes, for experiments with electricity.\n3.1 A Torchlight\ng\nYou might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a ﬂ ashlight.\nActivity 3.1: Let us explore\nTake a torchlight similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.1.\nObserve it carefully. Do you notice a lamp? And a switch?\nSlide its switch and observe. Does the torch lamp glow?\nNow slide the switch back to its original position and observe \nthe torch lamp.\nYou might have noticed that in the ﬁ rst position of the switch, \nthe torch lamp glows and in the other position the lamp does not \nglow.\nNow, open the torchlight. What do you ﬁ nd inside?\nInside the torchlight, you may ﬁ nd two or more electric cells. \nWhy does the torch lamp \nglow in one position of \nits switch?\nFig. 3.1: A torchlight\nElectricity: Circuits and their Components\n3.2 A Simple Electrical Circuit\np\nTo understand how a torch works, let us ﬁ rst ﬁ nd out about its \ncomponents.\n3.2.1 Electric cell\nActivity 3.2: Let us observe\nTake an electric cell, turn it around and look at \nit carefully (Fig. 3.2). Do you notice a positive \n(+) sign and a negative (–) sign marked on the \nelectric cell? Do you also notice that it has a \nsmall protruding metal cap on one side and a \nﬂ at metal disc on the other side?\nAll electric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) \nwhile the other is negative (– ve). The metal cap is the positive\nterminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative\nterminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy.\n3.2.2 Battery\nActivity 3.3: Let us experiment\nTake a torch which uses two cells. Open its cell compartment \nand take out the cells.\nPut the cells back in a diﬀ erent order. Also, try reversing \nthe direction of one cell. Then, slide the switch and check \nwhether the lamp glows in each case. \nCheck the order in which the cells were placed in the torch \nwhen the lamp glows. \nThe lamp glows when the cells are placed in the order as \nshown in Fig. 3.3. Notice how the terminals of the two cells are \nconnected. The positive terminal of one cell is connected to the \nnegative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or \nmore cells is called a battery. \n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 3.3: A battery made up of (a) two cells (b) four cells\nFig. 3.2: An electric cell\nPositive \nterminal\nNegative \nterminal\nIn a torch, we generally \nuse more than one cell. \nAre those placed in any \nparticular order?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nFig. 3.4: (a) A small incandescent \nlamp used in a torch (b) its \nsimpliﬁ ed drawing showing \nthe connection of wires to the \nterminals\nHowever, \nmy \ntorch \nhas \na \ndiﬀ erent kind of lamp.

Many old torchlights \nstill use such lamps. With your teacher’s help, conﬁ rm \nthat your torchlight uses an incandescent lamp.\nTake the torch and examine its lamp. What do you \nsee? Do you notice a thin wire ﬁ xed in the middle \nof the glass bulb? \nNow, switch on the torch. Which part of the lamp \nglows? \nThe thin wire inside the glass bulb of the lamp glows. \nThe glowing thin wire is called the ﬁ lament of the lamp. \nTake out the lamp with the help of your teacher and \ninspect it from all sides. How is the ﬁ lament ﬁ xed?\nThe ﬁ lament is attached to two thicker wires that \nsupport it, as shown in Fig. 3.4a. One thick wire connects \nto the metal case at the lamp’s base, while the other \nconnects to the metal tip at the centre of the base (Fig. \n3.4b). These form the two terminals of the lamp, and \nare ﬁ xed in a way that they do not touch each other. \nIn such incandescent lamps, the ﬁ lament gets hot and \nglows to produce light. \nElectricity: Circuits and their Components\nFig. 3.6: LEDs of different colours\n+\n- +\n+\n+\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\nLED Lamp\nMany torches in use today have a Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamp, \ninstead of an incandescent lamp, as shown in Fig. 3.5. \nFig. 3.5: An LED lamp for torch\nLED lamp\ng\nActivity 3.5: Let us observe\nTake an LED of any colour (Fig. 3.6) and \nobserve. Do you see any ﬁ lament inside it?\nNotice the length of two wires attached to \nthe LED. Do you ﬁ nd one of those longer \nthan the other?\nUnlike incandescent lamps, LEDs do not \nhave ﬁ laments (Fig. 3.6). They also have two \nterminals, but one is positive (attached to a \nlonger wire) and the other is negative (the \nshorter wire). A torch may use one or more \nLEDs, sometimes of diﬀ erent shapes, in its \nlamp.\nAfter having learnt about the electric cell, battery, and electric \nlamps, we are now ready to make the torch lamp glow using an \nelectric cell or battery.\n3.2.4 Making an electric lamp glow using an \nelectric cell or battery\nActivity 3.6: Let us construct\nTake an electric cell, an incandescent lamp used in a torch, a \ncell holder, a lamp holder, and four lengths of electric wire.\nRemove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of \neach wire to expose the metal.\nAttach two wires to the two ends of the cell holder as shown \nin Fig. 3.7a.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nSpring\nFig. 3.7: (a) An electric cell holder with two wires attached (b) An electric cell \ninside the cell holder (c) Wires connected to an electric cell using electrical tape\nInsert the cell in the holder such that its negative terminal \nis towards the spring side of the holder (Fig. 3.7b).

Fix the lamp in the holder by turning it around in \nthe holder (Fig. 3.8b).

Some of the ways in which the lamp and the cell \ncan be connected are shown in Table 3.1. \n\nPredict, for each arrangement, if the lamp will glow or \nnot and write your prediction in Table 3.1.\n\nNow, connect the lamp and the cell, and observe if the \nlamp glows or not. Note down your observation in Table \n3.1. Also, for the lamps which glow, colour their glass \nbulbs yellow.\nElectricity: Circuits and their Components\nTable 3.1: Trying to make the lamp glow\nS.No.\nArrangement of Cell and Lamp \n1.\n2.\n3.\n5.\n6.\n4.\nPrediction\nObservation\nNote: The lamps are not shown glowing in any circuit\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nThe lamp glows in the arrangements at S.No. 1 and 6 and does \nnot glow in the remaining arrangements. Now, carefully look at \nthe arrangements in which the lamp glows. Compare these with \nthose in which the lamp does not glow. Can you ﬁ nd the reason \nfor the diﬀ erence?\n3.2.5 An electrical circuit\nThe lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to \none terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the \nlamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This \nsetup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a \ncomplete path for electric current to ﬂ ow through \nthe lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes \nthrough the circuit.\nThe direction of electric current in an electrical \ncircuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative \nterminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of \nthe lamp are connected with those of the electric cell \nby wires, the current passes through the ﬁ lament \nof the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With \nan incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of \nits terminals connects to the positive or negative \nterminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as \nthe circuit is complete and current ﬂ ows through \nthe ﬁ lament.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nSometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when \nconnected to a cell. We say the lamp has ‘fused’ usually due to \na broken ﬁ lament. A broken ﬁ lament stops the ﬂ ow of current, \npreventing the lamp from glowing.\nLet us now try to make an LED glow.\nActivity 3.7: Let us experiment\nTake two electric cells, an LED of any colour, a cell holder \nthat can ﬁ t two cells (Fig. 3.8a), and two lengths of electric \nwire.\nRemove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of \neach wire to expose the metal.\nConnect the two wires to the cell holder as shown in \nFig. 3.10a. \nFig. 3.9: An electrical circuit\nElectricity: Circuits and their Components\nInsert two cells in the holder, taking care \nthat for each cell, its negative terminal \nis towards the spring side of the holder \n(Fig. 3.10b) and the battery is ready to use. \nHow will you decide which is the positive \nterminal of this battery?\nThe terminal of the holder which is connected \nto the positive terminal of one cell is positive \nand the one connected to the negative terminal \nof the other cell is the negative terminal.\nNow, connect the free end of the battery \npositive terminal wire to the longer wire of \nLED, and the free end of the second wire to \nthe shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c). Does the \nLED glow?\nRepeat the above step but interchange the \nwires connected to the LED (Fig. 3.10d). \nDoes the LED glow again?\nYou would have observed that the LED glows \nin the ﬁ rst case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in \nthe other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current \ncan pass through the LED in one direction only. \nThe current passes through the LED only when \nthe positive terminal (longer wire) of the LED is \nconnected to the positive terminal of the battery, \nand negative terminal (shorter wire) of the LED \nis connected to the negative terminal of the \nbattery. When current passes through the LED, \nit glows. Always take care to connect an LED \ncorrectly in a circuit to make it glow.\nFig. 3.10: Making an LED glow\n(c)\n+\n+\n–\n–\n(d)\n+\n+\n–\n–\n(a)\n(b)\n+\n–\nSometimes you may come across a device in which the cells are placed \nside by side. Then, how are the terminals of the cells connected?\nIf you carefully look inside \nthe battery compartment, you \nwill usually see a thick wire \nor metal strip connecting the \npositive terminal of one cell \nto the negative terminal of \nthe next.

Does the lamp glow?\nRotate the free end of the safety pin till it \ntouches the other drawing pin as shown in \nFig. 3.8b. Does the lamp glow now?\nWhen the safety pin touches both drawing \npins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and \nallows the current to ﬂ ow. We call this the ON\nposition (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed \nand current ﬂ ows from the cell’s positive to \nnegative terminal making the lamp glow. When \nthe safety pin does not touch the second drawing \npin, the gap in the circuit prevents current ﬂ ow, \nand the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position \n(Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open.\nNote that a switch can be placed anywhere in \na circuit. A switch is a simple device that either \ncompletes or breaks a circuit.

Did the lamp glow for all \nmaterials?\nThe lamp glows for some materials only. This means that \nelectric current can pass easily through some materials but not \nthrough others. The materials through which electric current \ncan ﬂ ow easily are called good conductors, or conductors of \nelectricity. The materials through which current cannot pass \nthrough are called insulators, or poor conductors of electricity. \nBased on the observations you have recorded in Table 3.3, \nconclude which materials are conductors of electricity and \nwhich are insulators. Note it in Table 3.3.\nFrom your conclusions in Table 3.3, you would have realised \nthat metals are conductors of electricity, and thus, are used for \nmaking wires. \nSilver, copper, and gold are the best electrical conductors. \nHowever, for making electrical wires, mainly copper is used \ndue to its comparatively lower cost and abundant supply. \nDiﬀ erent types of electrical wires are used for diﬀ erent uses.\nmak\nDIVE\nEEPER\nFrom Table 3.3, you would have also realised that plastic, \nrubber, and ceramics are electrical insulators. Have you now \nunderstood why wires are covered with those materials?\nConductors and insulators are both important. Electrical \nwires, switches, connectors of plugs, and sockets are made of \nconductors. Insulators like rubber, plastics, and ceramics are \nused to cover wires, plug tops, and switches to protect people \nfrom electric shocks.\nCaution — Our body is a conductor of electricity. Electric current \npassing through our body may cause severe injury or even death.\nAlways handle electrical appliances with care.

Electricity from batteries usually powers small \ndevices and is of a type called Direct Current (DC).

Their school \nhas assigned them a project to learn about craftspersons who \nwork with metals. They decide to visit the local ironsmiths who \npractise this craft. Yashwant and Anandi request their grandfather \nto accompany them (Fig. 4.1). They are curious to learn how these \nironsmiths make diﬀ erent items of daily use. They interact with \nan elderly craftsperson, Sudarshan uncle. \nYashwant: Which items do you generally make?\nSudarshan: Generally, we make items of daily use, such as ﬂ at \npans (tawas), buckets (baltis), tongs (chimtas), and farming tools \nlike spades (phawras), axes (kulhadis), trowels (khurpis), and \nrakes (jelees). \nAnandi: What materials are they made of?\n Fig. 4.1: Ironsmith making various items\nThe World of Metals \nand Non-metals\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nSudarshan: We use iron metal to make these items. We also use \nwood to prepare handles wherever required. Additionally, we \nuse coal in our furnaces to heat the iron.\nSudarshan is heating an iron block in the furnace. It has become \nred hot. He starts beating it hard with a hammer.\nAnandi is amazed and asks, “Why are you beating it?” \nSudarshan: I am beating it to shape it into an axe.\nAnandi: Wow, a piece of iron can be beaten into a ﬂ at shape! Can \nwe do this with other metals as well?\nYou may also have many such questions — let us explore what \nelse we can do with metals.\n4.1 Properties of Materials\n4.1.1 Malleability\nActivity 4.1: Let us explore\nCaution— Conduct this activity under the supervision of your teacher \nor an adult.\nCollect some waste pieces of copper and aluminium, an iron \nnail, a piece of coal, a pea-sized lump of sulfur (gandhak), \nand a block of wood.\nRecall the chapter ‘Materials Around Us’ in the Grade 6 \nScience textbook Curiosity and observe the appearances of \nthe above items. Are they lustrous? Also, note whether they \nare hard or soft and record  your observations in Table 4.1.\nFig. 4.2: Beating an iron nail with a hammer\nNow, place each of these \nitems one by one on any \nhard surface and beat them \nwith a hammer (Fig. 4.2). \nWhat do you think will \nhappen? \nDo \nthe \nobjects \nbecome slightly ﬂ attened or \ndo they break into pieces? \nRecord your observations in \nTable 4.1.\nThe World of Metals and Non-metals\nAppearance\n(lustrous/ \nnon-lustrous)\nEffect of hammering \n(ﬂ attens/breaks into \npieces)\nPiece of copper \n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\nPiece of aluminium\nIron nail\nLump of sulfur \n(pea-sized)\nPiece of coal\nBlock of wood\nObject/Material\nS.No.\nHard/Soft\nTable 4.1: Appearance, hardness, and eﬀ ect of hammering on diﬀ erent \nobjects or materials\nAnalyse Table 4.1. Identify the objects that are lustrous in \nappearance and hard. You might have observed that objects made \nfrom copper, aluminium, and iron are lustrous in appearance \nand are hard. Lustre shown by metals is known as metallic \nlustre. Materials like copper, aluminium, and iron are known as \nmetals, whereas, coal, sulfur, and wood are non-lustrous and \nnot as hard as metals. \nAre all metals hard and solid? Not really; some metals like \nsodium and potassium are so soft that they can be cut with a \nknife. There is one metal, mercury, that is found in a liquid state at \nroom temperature, which you might have seen in thermometers. \nRecall the chapter ‘Temperature and its Measurement’ from the \nGrade 6 Science textbook Curiosity. \nWhich objects did you ﬁ nd become ﬂ at on beating with a \nhammer?\nYou must have observed that objects such as a piece of copper, \nan iron nail, and a piece of aluminium become ﬂ at when beaten; \nwhereas other objects or materials behave diﬀ erently. This \nproperty by which materials can be beaten into thin sheets is \ncalled malleability. Most metals possess this property. Can you \ngive some examples of metal sheets? You might have seen thin \nsilver foil on some sweets and aluminium foil used for wrapping \nfood items. These are formed due to their malleability. Gold and \nsilver are the most malleable metals. \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nA piece of coal or a lump of sulfur does not show this behaviour. \nThey break into pieces and are said to be brittle. On the other \nhand, wood neither gets ﬂ attened into a sheet nor breaks into \npieces. Therefore, wood is neither malleable nor brittle. \nHOLISTIC LENS\nThe impact of iron on the progress of civilisation of India\nIn the Grade 6 Social Science textbook Exploring Society India and \nBeyond, you learnt about the Harappans. They knew how to use \nmetals like copper and gold. They used these metals to make various \nobjects, from utensils to jewellery. However, you would hardly ﬁ nd \nany evidence of the Harappans using a very prominent metal iron, \nwhich you see a lot around you today. This is because it took a long \ntime before iron was used in day-to-day activities.\n \nHowever, once the use of iron gained prominence in the times that \nfollowed, it contributed signiﬁ cantly to the progress of civilisation in \nIndia. For instance, due to its strength, agricultural tools like ploughs \nmade from iron were much superior to those used previously. \n \nWhat could be the potential reason that it is generally considered \nthat copper was discovered earlier as compared to iron?\nw\nt\nf\nI\nm\nt\n4.1.2 Ductility\nWhere do you ﬁ nd the use of metal wires? \nYou might have seen wires of metals like copper or aluminium \nin electrical ﬁ ttings. Some ornaments, like bangles, necklaces, \nearrings, etc., are also made from metal wires. Metal wires play \nimportant functions in a variety of stringed musical instruments, \nsuch as veena, sitar, violin, and guitar.\nThis property of materials by which they can be drawn into \nwires is called ductility.\nThis property of ductility is mainly possessed by metals.\nGold \nis \nso \nductile \nthat one gram of it \ncan be drawn into a \n2 kilometre-long wire! \nThe \nductile \nnature \nof \nmetals enables for \nthe creation of \nthis tea strainer \nwith metal wire.\nThe World of Metals and Non-metals\nHave you ever seen wires made of coal or sulfur? Obviously \nnot! We can say that coal and sulfur are not ductile.\nDo you know that ropes made of steel [a mixture \nof metal (iron) and non-metal (carbon)] wires can \nsupport heavy loads? Therefore, they are used in \nsuspension bridges and in cranes to lift heavy objects.\nDIVE\nEEPER\nSuspension bridge\n4.1.3 Sonority\nHave you ever noticed the sound produced when a metal spoon, \nor a metal plate, or a metal coin is dropped on the ﬂ oor? How is it \ndiﬀ erent from the sound produced when a piece of coal or wood \nis dropped on the ﬂ oor?  \nActivity 4.2: Let us investigate\nCaution— Be careful while dropping the \nobjects.\nTake a few objects, such as a metal \nspoon, a coin, a piece of coal, and \na block of wood. \nDrop them one by one from a certain height.\nDo you notice any diﬀ erence in the sound \nproduced by these objects? \nI use the diﬀ erence in \nsound when my stick \nhits wood or metal to \nhelp ﬁ nd my way.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nYou would observe that the metal spoon and the metal coin \nproduce a ringing sound. Coal and wood, on the other hand, \nproduce dull sounds. \nThis property of metals that enables them to produce a ringing \nsound is called sonority, and metals are said to be sonorous in \nnature. \nOh! The ringing sound \nof my ghungroos\nis also due to the \nsonority of metals.\nNow, I understand! \nThe ringing sound \nof the school bell is \ndue to the sonority \nof metals.\nN\no\nd\n4.1.4 Conduction of heat\nHave you ever observed the vessels used for cooking in the \nkitchen? You might have noticed that the vessels used for heating \nare made of metals. Can you name some metals that are used for \nmaking cooking vessels? Do you know why these metals are used \nfor this purpose?\nLet us ﬁ nd out!\nActivity 4.3: Let us investigate\nCaution— This activity must be performed under the supervision of \nyour teacher or an adult. Be careful while handling hot water.\nPlace a glass tumbler on a table. \nFill it with hot water. \nTake a metal spoon and a wooden \nspoon of almost the same size and \nthickness.\nImmerse \nboth \nthe \nspoons \nsimultaneously into the hot water \n(Fig. 4.3) and leave them undisturbed \nfor a few minutes.\nNow, carefully touch the upper end \nof each spoon.\nWooden \nspoon\nMetal \nspoon\nFig. 4.3: Metal and wooden spoons \nimmersed in hot water\nThe World of Metals and Non-metals\nSome discussion points:\nWhich of the spoons get hotter?\nWhat does this experiment tell us about heat transfer along \nthe two spoons? \nYou may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch \nthan the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed \nin the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This \nshows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it \nhotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. \nIn such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another \nof a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer \nheat are called conductors.\nBased on the observations, one can say that metals are good \nconductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat. \nNow, we can understand why mostly metal vessels are used \nfor cooking, and their handles are made with wood or other \nmaterials that do not conduct heat. You will learn more about \nthis in the chapter ‘Heat Transfer in Nature’. \n4.1.5 Conduction of electricity\nHave you ever seen an electrician using a screwdriver? What \ntype of material is used for making its handle? You may have \nalso noticed the electrician wearing rubber gloves and shoes \nwhile working. What can be the reason for this?\nActivity 4.4: Let us design and create\nDesign an electric circuit, like the ‘tester’ circuit in the chapter \n‘Electricity: Circuits and their Components’. Repeat the same \nactivity using the materials listed below and record your \nobservations in Table 4.2.\nYou may collect a few objects, such as a piece of aluminium \nfoil, an iron nail, a lump of sulfur (pea-sized), a copper wire, \na piece of coal, a piece of dry wood, a stone, an eraser made \nof rubber and a piece of nylon rope.\nPredict which of these could make the bulb of the tester \nglow and which could not. \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nTable 4.2: Conduction of electricity by diﬀ erent objects or materials\nObservation \n(bulb glows/does \nnot glow)\nPiece of \naluminium foil\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\nIron nail\n…\nLump of sulfur \n(pea-sized)\nObject/Material\nS.No.\nGood conductor of \nelectricity or poor \nconductor of electricity\nYou might have observed that objects made of aluminium, \niron, and copper make the bulb glow, whereas sulfur, coal, \nwood, stone, eraser, and nylon rope could not make it glow. Do \nyou see any pattern in the glowing of bulbs when using diﬀ erent \nmaterials in Activity 4.4? It is observed that all the materials that \nmake the bulb glow are metals.\nMaterials that allow electricity to ﬂ ow through them easily \nare called good conductors of electricity. In contrast, materials \nthat prevent the bulb from glowing by not allowing electricity to \npass through them are called poor conductors of electricity. \nSo, now we can understand that the plastic covering on \nscrewdrivers and rubber gloves protect the electrician from \nelectric shock because these materials are poor conductors of \nelectricity.\nWe learnt that metals are generally hard, lustrous, malleable, \nductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity. Now, let us \nlearn how metals behave in the presence of air and water.\n4.2 Eﬀ ect of Air and Water on Metals: Iron\nYou would have often noticed that iron objects develop brown \ndeposits when left in the open for a few days. In which conditions \nwould an iron object develop brown deposits? \nWhen it comes into contact with dry air only.\nWhen it comes into contact with water only.\nWhen it comes into contact with both air and water.\nThe World of Metals and Non-metals\nActivity 4.5: Let us experiment\nCaution— Be careful while handling iron nails.\nTake a few shining iron nails. If you are using old iron \nnails, make sure to remove brown deposits from their \nsurface by scrubbing them with the help of a small \npiece of sandpaper.\nTake three clean, dry glass bottles or test tubes with \ntight-ﬁ tting caps or stoppers. Label them A, B, and C.\nTake three iron nails and tie each iron nail with a thread. \nPlace one iron nail and some silica gel in the glass bottle \n‘A’, and tighten the cap or stopper (Fig. 4.4a). Silica gel \nmakes the air dry. It is the substance that is used in \nsmall pouches in some medicine bottles, water bottles, \nshoe boxes, etc., to keep them dry.\nPlace one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘B’. Pour freshly \nboiled and cooled water (to remove dissolved gases) \ninto it until the iron nail is completely dipped in it. Now, \npour some oil to form a layer over the surface of the \nwater (Fig. 4.4b). The layer of oil on the surface of the \nwater prevents the air from dissolving in the water. Cap \nthe glass bottle tightly. \nPlace one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘C’, and pour some \nwater so that the iron nail is partially dipped. Keep this \nglass bottle unstoppered. This allows the iron nail to \ncome into contact with both water and air, as shown in \nFig. 4.4c.\nPlace all the glass bottles undisturbed at room \ntemperature and observe the changes for 8 – 10 days.\nRecord your observations in Table 4.3.\nTable 4.3: Formation of brown deposit on iron nails\nConditions\nA\nNo\nB\nC\nGlass\nBottle\nObservations\nPresence of water \n(Yes/No)  \nPresence of air\n (Yes/No)  \nYes\nFig. 4.4: Glass bottles \ncontaining iron nails\nFig. 4.4(a)\nA\nIron nail\nThread\nSilica gel\nB\nFig. 4.4(b)\nIron nail\nThread\nOil\nWater\nC\nFig. 4.4(c)\nIron nail\nThread\nWater\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nWhat can you conclude from this experiment? \nIt is observed in glass bottles A and B that the iron nails do not \nshow any brown deposits. What does this observation indicate? \nThis indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron \nnails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone \n(bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the \niron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that \nthe presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits \nto develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of \nbrown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is \ncalled rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of \niron is called rusting. \nMany other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open \nin the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green \ncoating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the \nsurface of silver objects? Gradual deterioration of metal surfaces \ncaused by air, water, or other substances is known as corrosion. \nDo you know that rusting of iron is a serious problem in our \ncountry? Every year, an enormous amount of money is spent to \nreplace or repair iron structures damaged due to rusting. \nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by several methods such \nas painting, oiling, greasing, and applying a protective layer of \nzinc metal on iron (galvanisation). We will learn about this in \nhigher grades.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy!     \nThe Iron Pillar of Delhi was made in the time of \nChandragupta II more than 1600 years ago. It is about \n8 metres high and weighs more than 6000 kilograms. \nWhat is interesting about this iron pillar is that despite \nall these years of facing winds, rainfall, and intense \nweather, it has barely any rust. \nreplace or repair \nThe rusting of \nas painting, oilin\nzinc metal on iro\nhigher grades.\nFASCINATING\nThe wonder of\nThe Iron Pillar\nChandragupta II\n8 metres high a\nWhat is interest\nall these years \nweather, it has b\nThe Iron Pillar (Delhi)\nIn other words, it has been made in \na way that it resists rusting.

Clean \nit by rubbing with a piece of \nsandpaper.\nHold it with a pair of tongs. \nIgnite the other end using a \nspirit lamp or a candle (Fig. 4.5).\nLet the magnesium ribbon burn.\nWhat do you observe?\nYou must have observed that \nmagnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling white ﬂ ame and \nchanges into a white powder. Collect it on a watch glass. This \npowder is magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction \nbetween magnesium and oxygen present in the air. \nAdd a few drops of warm water to this white powder, stir it \nwell, and check its nature. \nRecall the chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and \nNeutral’. Find out whether the solution of magnesium oxide \nis acidic or basic or neutral in nature. You can use any \nacid-base indicator.\nWhat eﬀ ect does this solution have \non blue and red litmus papers?\nYou would observe that it changes \nthe colour of red litmus paper to blue \n(Fig. 4.6); hence, it is basic in nature. \nGenerally, oxides of metals are basic in \nnature.\nWe will discuss this burning of \nmagnesium \nribbon \nfurther \nin \nthe \nchapter ‘Changes Around Us: Physical \nand Chemical’.\nFig. 4.5: Burning magnesium ribbon\nFig. 4.6: Testing the nature of \nmagnesium oxide\nRed litmus \npaper\nBlue litmus \npaper\nWatch \nglass\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nFig. 4.7(a): Deﬂ agrating \nspoon\nDo you know that sodium is a metal which is stored in kerosene \nbecause it reacts vigorously with oxygen and water.

Burning sulfur produces gases, which \ncan be harmful if inhaled. \nTake a small amount of powdered sulfur in a \ndeﬂ agrating spoon (it is a long-handled metal \nspoon used in experiments to safely heat and burn \nsubstances Fig. 4.7a). If a deﬂ agrating spoon is not \navailable, you may take a metallic cap of any bottle, \nwrap a metallic wire around it and give it the shape \nas shown in Fig. 4.7b.\nHeat it on a ﬂ ame, and as soon as the sulfur starts \nburning, introduce the deﬂ agrating spoon into a \ngas jar or glass tumbler (Fig. 4.7c). Cover the gas jar \nor glass tumbler with a lid to ensure that the gas \nproduced does not escape.\nRemove the lid after 3 – 4 minutes and take out the \ndeﬂ agrating spoon. Add a small quantity of water \ninto the gas jar, quickly place the lid back and shake \nit so that the gas dissolves. \nAgain, recall the chapter ‘Exploring Substances: \nAcidic, Basic, and Neutral’. Using an acid-base \nindicator, check whether the solution obtained \nafter the addition of water to the gas jar is acidic or \nbasic or neutral. \nWhat do you observe?\nThe World of Metals and Non-metals\nYou would observe that it is acidic in \nnature (Fig. 4.7d). \nOn burning sulfur in air (oxygen), \nsulfur dioxide gas is formed. On dissolving \nsulfur dioxide gas in water, sulfurous acid \nis formed.\nDoes sulfur behave in water the same \nway metals do?\nActivity 4.8: Let us explore\nTake some sulfur powder in a glass tumbler. \nAdd a small amount of water to it.\nWhat do you observe?\nYou may have noticed that there is no reaction when sulfur is \nplaced in water. \nSubstances like sulfur and phosphorus behave diﬀ erently \nwith air and water than metals. Phosphorus is stored in water \nas it catches ﬁ re when exposed to atmospheric air. These \nsubstances are usually soft and dull in appearance. They are \nneither malleable nor ductile, and they are not sonorous. They \nare also poor conductors of heat and electricity. These are called \nnon-metals. Their oxides are acidic in nature. \nSome other non-metals are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, \netc. These must not be confused with materials such as plastic, \nglass, wood, rubber, and paper. These materials are not classiﬁ ed \nas metals or non-metals because they are not elements. \nMetals and non-metals are sub-categories of \nsubstances called elements. An element is a substance \nthat cannot be broken down into simpler substances. \nPresently 118 elements are known. These \nelements are the basic building blocks of all matter. \nSome are naturally occurring, while others are \nartiﬁ cially made in the laboratory, and do not exist \nin nature.

Some of them are listed in Table 5.1, you may notice that \nsomething is changing in each case. Take a moment to reﬂ ect on \nthe changes in each case. Record your observations in Table 5.1.\nTable 5.1: Some changes observed around us\nMaking popcorn from corn\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\nCutting a piece of paper\nAdding beetroot extract to water\nBurning wood  \nDrying wet clothes \n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\nMaking small balls of dough \nRolling small balls of dough into chapatis\nAny other\nObservation(s)\nMelting ice cubes\n1.\n2.\n3.\nChopping vegetables \nBoiling water\nChange\nS.No.\nYou might have noticed that these changes could be in the size, \nshape, smell, or other property of the substance or object. Can you \nthink of some other changes that happen in your surroundings? \nMake a list of those changes too.  \nWe observe the changes occurring around us with the help of \nour senses of sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste.\nCan we arrange these \nchanges into categories?\nLet us try to answer this question.\n Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical\n5.1 A Substance May Change in \nAppearance but Remain the Same!\npp\np\nActivity 5.2: Let us create and discuss\nA. Creating some objects with paper \nTake a few sheets of paper \nand fold them to create \nnew objects (Fig. 5.1).\nDo you get the same paper \nback when you unfold \nthese objects?\nB. Playing with a balloon\nTake a balloon and inﬂ ate \nit. Now, loosen your grip \nand let the air escape out.\nDo you get the uninﬂ ated balloon back? \nTake another balloon; inﬂ ate it and grip the opening \ntightly. Now, prick it with a pin. \nCaution — Be careful while using a pin.\nWhat happens? Will you be able to get the uninﬂ ated \nballoon back?\nC. Crushing a piece of chalk\nCrush a small piece of chalk into powder.\nCan you get the chalk piece back from the powder?\nIs there any similarity in the changes listed in A, B, and C?\nDuring all these changes, materials, such as the paper, the \nrubber sheet of the balloon, and the chalk, remained the same, \nthough their appearances (shape or size) may have changed. You \nmay also recall from the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity that \nwater can exist in diﬀ erent states (solid, liquid, and gas), and can \nchange from one state to another. \nIn all these cases, although we observe a change in the \nappearance, no new substance is formed. Such changes in which \nonly physical properties like shape, size, and state of substances \nchange are called physical changes. \nLet us explore a diﬀ erent type of change.\nFig. 5.1: Objects made from paper\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n5.2 A Substance May Change in \nAppearance and Not Remain \nthe Same!\nActivity 5.3: Let us explore \nTake two glass tumblers or small transparent bottles. Mark \nthem A and B. \nFill one-fourth of glass tumbler A with tap water and \none-fourth of glass tumbler B with lime water. \nNow, blow air (exhale) into each glass tumbler, one at a time, \nusing separate straws (Fig. 5.2) and observe them. \nCaution — Do not suck the water or lime water while doing this.\nStraw\nStraw\n(a)\nA\nB\n(b)\nGlass tumbler  \ncontaining tap \nwater\nGlass tumbler \ncontaining \nlime water\nFig. 5.2: Blowing air in (a) tap water; (b) lime water\nDo you notice any changes?  \nIn glass tumbler A, blowing air into water creates bubbles \nonly, and there is no change in the appearance of the water. In \nglass tumbler B, blowing air into lime water creates bubbles, and \nturns the lime water milky (or cloudy). If we leave it for some \ntime, a white substance settles at the bottom of the glass tumbler, \nindicating something new has formed. Such changes, in which \none or more new substances are formed, are called chemical \nchanges. New substances are formed through a process called \nchemical reaction. In this case, carbon dioxide from the air you \nbreathe out (exhale) reacts with lime water, and forms a new \nwhite-coloured substance (calcium carbonate) that is insoluble \nin water. Therefore, the liquid in the bottle appears milky. Along \nwith this a small amount of water is also formed. This formation \nof a new substance indicates a chemical change. The chemical \nreaction involved in this change can be represented in short \nform as a chemical equation. \n Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical\nCalcium hydroxide + Carbon dioxide \n Calcium carbonate + Water\n       (Lime water) \n(Insoluble substance)\nThe turning of lime water milky is also used as a test for \ncarbon dioxide. Let us explore this with another activity using \nsome substances from our kitchen.\nActivity 5.4: Let us experiment \nTake a teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon juice in a test tube.\nAdd a pinch of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) \nto it.\nWhat do you observe?\nYou would hear a ﬁ zzing bubbling sound and see the gas \nbubbles forming.\nPass this gas through freshly prepared lime water kept in \nanother test tube, as shown in Fig. 5.3a. \nWhat do you observe?\nThe lime water turns milky. What do you infer about the gas \nformed by mixing vinegar and baking soda?\nThis indicates that the gas formed is carbon dioxide.\nThis activity can also be performed using two small used \nbottles instead of test tubes and a ﬂ exible straw, as shown in \nFig. 5.3b.\nFig. 5.3: Reaction of vinegar and baking soda\nBubbles of \ncarbon dioxide gas\nLime water\nVinegar and \nbaking soda\n(a)\n(b)\nas\nSince a new substance, carbon dioxide, is formed in this \nreaction, we say that a chemical change has occurred here as \nwell. It can be represented as—\nVinegar + Baking soda \n Carbon dioxide + Other substances\nRepeat the above activity using baking soda and water. Do you \nobserve any bubble formation? Is this a physical or a chemical \nchange?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n5.3 Some Other Processes Involving \nChemical Changes\ng\n5.3.1 Rusting\nIn the rusting of iron, which you studied \nin the chapter ‘The World of Metals and \nNon-metals’, a new brown-coloured \nsubstance called rust is formed. Thus, \nrusting is also a chemical change because \nit involves the formation of a new \nsubstance, iron oxide (Fig. 5.4). \n5.3.2 Combustion\nLet us recall the burning of a magnesium ribbon \n(Fig. 5.5) learnt in the chapter ‘The World of \nMetals and Non-metals’. Can you predict if this is \na physical or a chemical change?\nWhen the magnesium ribbon is burnt, a new \nsubstance, magnesium oxide, is formed. So, the \nburning of magnesium ribbon also involves a \nchemical change. We observed that heat and light \nare also produced along with the formation of a \nnew substance in this reaction.\nThe burning of magnesium ribbon can be represented as—\nMagnesium + Oxygen \n Magnesium oxide + Heat + Light\n \n   (Ribbon)          (Air)         (White powder)\nA chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen \nand produces heat and/or light is called combustion. Substances \nthat undergo combustion reactions are called combustible\nsubstances. For example, wood, paper, cotton, kerosene, etc., \nare combustible substances.\nFig. 5.4: Rusted \niron nails\nFig. 5.5: Burning magnesium ribbon \nLet us ﬁ nd out whether the presence of oxygen \nis essential for combustion. \nActivity 5.5: Let us investigate \nPlace two identical candles on two separate \npetri dishes and light them.\nCover one of these with a glass tumbler, as \nshown in Fig. 5.6. \nWhat happens to the candle ﬂ ames in the two \ncases?     \nFig. 5.6: Candle (a) burning \n(b) covered with a glass tumbler\n(a)\n(b)\n Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical\nWe observe that the candle that was not covered (Fig. 5.6a) \ncontinues to burn, whereas the candle that was covered with a \nglass tumbler (Fig. 5.6b) stops burning after some time. Why does \nthis happen?\nSince the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have \na continuous supply of air, the ﬂ ame gets extinguished soon. \nThe component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This \ncan be conﬁ rmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass \ntumbler inverted on the candle. How can you test the presence \nof carbon dioxide gas? \nYou can test the carbon dioxide gas by adding a small amount \nof lime water in the petri dish. You will notice that it turns milky. \nThis carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and \nthe oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for \ncombustion.\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nIf a person’s clothes catch ﬁ re, what is the best way to extinguish \nthe ﬁ re?\nWrap a blanket or cloth around the person. This cuts oﬀ  the \nsupply of air, and the ﬁ re gets extinguished. \nCaution — Synthetic blanket or cloth should never be used to put \nout a ﬁ re, as these can melt and stick to the skin.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nNature’s wonders: You might have \nseen some insects emitting light in \na garden or a ﬁ eld in late evenings. \nThese insects are called ﬁ reﬂ ies, and \ntheir light is produced by a chemical \nchange. This type of light production \n(without heat) in living organisms is \ncalled bioluminescence.\nFireflies \n \n \nFireflies\nIs the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion?\nWe learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen \nare necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a \ncombustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any \nlength of time without it catching ﬁ re. What else is needed to \nstart combustion?\nLet us learn about this.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nActivity 5.6: Let us investigate \nCaution — Perform this activity under the supervision of your teacher \nor an adult.\nHold a piece of paper with a pair of \ntongs and bring a lighted matchstick \nto it. It quickly catches ﬁ re. Do we say \nthat we need a ﬁ re to start the burning \nprocess? \nTake another piece of paper. Using a \nmagnifying glass, focus the sunrays to \nmake the smallest and brightest spot on \nthe paper, as shown in the Fig. 5.7a. \nHold it there for some time. \nWhat do you observe?\nWe observe that the paper starts to \nemit \nsmoke, \nand \nthen \ncatches \nﬁ re \n(Fig. 5.7b). Thus, we ﬁ nd that a substance \ncan burn even without ﬁ re. How do we \nexplain this change?\nFocusing sunrays on the paper heats \nit. The temperature of the paper increases \nwith time. After some time, the paper \nbecomes so hot that it starts burning. \nThis minimum temperature at which a \nsubstance catches ﬁ re is called its ignition \ntemperature. Since the temperature of the \nlighted matchstick was already higher than \nthe ignition temperature of the paper, it \ncaught ﬁ re almost immediately.\nFig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a \nmagnifying glass\nFig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire\nSo, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur, \nthere are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) —\n(i) A combustible substance, also called ‘fuel’\n(ii) Oxygen\n(iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature.\n5.4 Can Physical and Chemical Changes \nOccur in the Same Process? \nWhat changes take place when a candle is lit? Let us explore!\nFig. 5.8: Fire triangle\n Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical\nActivity 5.7: Think, pair, and share\nLook at the Fig. 5.9. Analyse what students are discussing about \nthe burning candle. \nWhat do you think?\nFig. 5.9: What changes occur when a candle burns?\nThe wax melts and \nevaporates...\nI think the wax burns, \nand new substances \nare formed… \nMaybe \nthe \nwick \ndraws up the liquid \nwax…\nWax melts, ﬂ ows, \nand solidiﬁ es in \ndiﬀ erent shapes...\nMaybe...\nThe wax of the candle melts, is carried up the wick, and \nevaporates due to the heat of the ﬂ ame. The vapour of wax burns \nto produce a ﬂ ame. The melting of wax, its solidiﬁ cation, and \nevaporation are physical changes. The burning of vapour on the \nother hand, is a chemical change. This shows that the burning of \na candle involves both physical and chemical changes.\nKNOW A SCIENTIST\nThe candle you just observed has long been an object of curiosity for \nseveral scientists including Michael Faraday, who made signiﬁ cant \ncontributions to several areas of science. In the \nnineteenth century, Faraday delivered a series \nof lectures called Chemical History of a Candle. \nFaraday believed that the candle was the perfect \nobject to introduce scientiﬁ c study. Through \nit, he discussed diﬀ erences between various \nphysical and chemical processes like melting, \nvapourisation, and combustion.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n5.5 Are Changes Permanent?\nOnce something has undergone a change, can we get it back in \nits original form?\ng\nActivity 5.8: Let us think\nThink again about all the changes that we have discussed \nor talked about so far. In which of these can we get back the \nobject or substance in the form we started with? Record your \nobservations in Table 5.2.\nTable 5.2: Can changes be reversed?\n5.\n...\n12.\n4.\nMaking popcorn from corn\nNo\nThe original state can be \nbrought back (Yes/No)\nMelting ice cubes\n1.\n2.\n3.\nChopping vegetables \nBoiling water\nChange\nS.No.\nYes\nNo\nYes\nReturning to the original object or substance with which we \nstarted shows that the changes we brought can be reversed. For \nexample, when ice melts, it can be refrozen into ice. Similarly, \nwhen water evaporates, it can be condensed back into liquid \nwater. However, some changes cannot be reversed since we \ncannot get the original object or substance back after the change. \nFor example, chopped vegetables cannot return to their original \nsize and shape, and making popcorn cannot go back to its original \nform. Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that \ncan be reversed and those that cannot be reversed.\n5.6 Are All Changes Desirable? \ng\nMany useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the \nchanging of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, \nand cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you \nthink of some other desirable changes happening around you?\n Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical\nOn the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such \nas the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. \nA change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable \nin other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be \nvery useful in converting food waste into compost.\nSome changes occurring over the years due to human activity \ncan have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the \nincreased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., \nis increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. \nDrying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many \nsubstances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution.\n5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes\ng\n5.7.1 Weathering of rocks\nHave you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of \nmountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How \nhave these formed? These are formed by physical changes that \nbreak up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due \nto climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of \nwater within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break.\nWater or chemicals present in water, can also react with \nthe rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An \nexample of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, \nan originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains \niron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The \nred colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock \nsurface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing \nwater vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are \ncollectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the \nformation of soil.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 5.10: (a) Sediments at the base of a cliff (b) red sediment layer\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n5.7.2 Erosion \nHave you noticed ﬁ ne sand collecting on riverbeds or in lakes? \nThis sand is formed when rock pebbles, soil, and sediments are \nbroken down and moved from one location to another by natural \nforces like wind and ﬂ owing water. This process is called erosion.\nErosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. \nRiver rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the \nconstant erosion caused by the ﬂ owing water. When the speed \nof the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the \nmaterial transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. \nThese sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most \nof these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot \nbe reversed.\nIn a Nutshell\nA physical change is one in which a substance or object \nundergoes a change in its physical properties and no new \nsubstance is formed.\nA chemical change is one in which one or more new \nsubstances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and \ncan be represented by a chemical equation.\nCombustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical \nchanges.\nSubstances that undergo combustion are combustible \nsubstances. Heat and/or light are given out during \ncombustion.\nThe lowest temperature at which a substance can catch ﬁ re \nis called its ignition temperature. \nSome changes can be reversed and some cannot.\nSome changes are desirable and some are not.\nRocks undergo physical and chemical changes due to \nweathering to form soil.\nErosion caused by ﬂ owing water and wind is a physical \nchange.\n Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical\nENQUIRY\nWHAT IF\nW\nH\nE\nN\nW\nH\nI\nC\nH\nH\nO\nW\nL\nO\nN\nG\nW\nHAT\nELSE\nWHY\nWHERE\nWHAT\nCOULD\nCAN \nIT\n?\nWHOSE\nWHAT WILL\nHAPPEN\nWHAT \nSHOULD\nWHY \nNOT\n?\nLet Us Enhance Our Learning\n1.

Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the \nappearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits, \nand new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge.\nIt is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities \nto produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs \nto grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing \nseeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity \nbefore they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch \ninto young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to \nyoung ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size \nand develop over time.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nThe journey of life of a human can be divided into different \nstages—infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. \nEach person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the \nduration of each stage may vary from one individual to another. \nFrom infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes. \nUntil around 10–12 years of age, most changes are related to \nheight and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to \noccur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid \ngrowth and development, typically occurring between the ages \nof 10–19. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood.\nHumans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce \nimmediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and \nreach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce.\nAs humans grow and develop, they experience significant \nphysical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the \nability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly \nobservable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed. \nIn this chapter, you will explore adolescence, understand its \nimportance, and learn how to handle it with a sense of responsibility.\n6.1\t Growing With Age: The Teenage Years\nDuring the summer vacation, Venkatesh visited his grandparents. \nAs he entered the house, his 12-year-old cousin, Devyani came \nrunning to greet him.\nYou have become \nso tall, Devyani!\nYour voice has \nalso changed!\nVenkatesh, \nyou \nhave \na \nthin \nmoustache now!! \nLet us try to understand this interesting conversation \nbetween Venkatesh and Devyani.\nActivity 6.1: Let us discuss\n\t\n Take a jar and some paper slips.\n\t\n Write down the changes you can notice among students as \nthey go from Grades 5 to 8. These could be related to height, \nstrength, behaviour, or any other aspect.

Based on the information \non the slips, discuss the changes with the students in the class.\nWhat were the most commonly observable changes among \nstudents, as mentioned on the slips? List these in Table 6.1.\nHeight\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\nWeight and strength\nAppearance\n…\nChanges\nYour observations\nS.No.\nTable 6.1: Most common changes during growing up\nHave you also experienced some of these changes? If yes, then \nit is because you are also reaching this stage gradually. This stage \nstarts around 10 years of age and can continue up to the age of \n19. It is usually a stage of development between childhood and \nadulthood, and is called adolescence.\nWhile analysing Table 6.1, you might have noticed the following:\nChanges in body structure, weight gain, and \nstrength\nAs boys grow, it might be seen that along with growing \ntaller, they gain weight, their shoulders might become \na bit broader, and their chests may get wider.\n\t\nGirls also undergo changes in height and weight, \nand other body changes like development of breasts. \nIncrease in height\nFrom birth, our body undergoes continuous growth \nand development including an increase in height. \nHowever, the increase in height becomes more \nprominent during adolescence.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nChanges in voice\nIn adolescent boys, the growth of the voice box leads \nto a voice that sounds hoarse. The voice box is a \nstructure in our throat that helps us to speak. The \ngrowth may be seen as a bump in the throat region \nand is called the Adam’s apple. However, it is not \nnoticeable in every individual. The voice box also \ngrows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the \nboys, leading to only slight changes in voice. \nChanges in facial skin: emergence of pimples\nAnother common occurrence during the adolescent \nyears is a skin condition called acne, in which small, \nreddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible \non the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily \nsecretions from the skin during adolescence that can \nclog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne \nis a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it.\nAppearance of hair in different parts of body\nBoth boys and girls experience the growth of hair in \ndifferent parts of their bodies, such as the armpits and \npubic region. \n\t\nBoys often develop facial hair, which later grows \ninto a moustache and a beard as they move towards \nadulthood. Some boys may also develop chest hair and \nback hair, though few boys may have no significant \nhair growth. Variations in and timing of appearance of \nhair growth is completely normal.\nA key point to remember\nWhether it is a change in height, voice, or facial hair, it is \nimportant to recognise that the timing, nature, and extent \nof these changes vary among individuals. These variations \nare completely normal.\n\t\nEach person experiences adolescence at his or her \nown pace, and its duration also varies from one person to \nanother.\nAdam's \napple\nAdolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change\nNow, we have understood some of the changes that take place \nduring adolescence, particularly those that are easily observable. \nSome of these characteristic changes, like change in voice, the growth \nof facial and chest hair in boys, and the development of breasts \nin girls  are not directly involved in the process of reproduction. \nHowever, these characteristic changes help distinguish males \nfrom females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual \ncharacteristics.\nSecondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the \nbody is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty. \nPuberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes \nexternal and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of \nreproduction. \n6.2\t Changes that Indicate Reproductive \nCapability\nAdolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also \nby internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such \nchange is the maturation of various parts involved in the process \nof reproduction.\nBoth boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and \nthese changes are a natural part of the process of growing up. \nAn important internal change associated with adolescent girls is \nthe onset of the menstrual cycle. It recurs generally every 28–30 \ndays and is more commonly known as ‘the period’. Many healthy \ngirls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from \n21–35 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process \nand is one of the signs of good reproductive health. The phase of \nthe cycle when blood discharge occurs from the body is referred \nto as menstruation. It may last for three to seven days. Some girls \nmay feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these \ndays. Usually, by the age of 45–55, menstruation stops naturally, \nmarking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman’s life.\nBreaking myths about menstruation\nThere are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that \noften lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These \nbeliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among \nsuch myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating \ngirls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a \nnatural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By \nencouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can \nhelp society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive \nhealth of women and contribute positively towards a healthier \nlifestyle for women.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nAdolescence is not just about physical changes or changes \nassociated with reproductive capability but also about emotional \nand behavioural changes. Let us discuss them!\n6.3\t Emotional and Behavioural Changes \nin Adolescents\nActivity 6.2: Let us list\nTake a moment to think if there are any changes in your emotions \nor behaviour or that of your classmates and friends in the past \none or two years. These changes may be exciting, confusing, or \nboth.\nLet us list some emotional changes in Table 6.2 along with \ntheir probable effects on behaviour and ways for positive growth \nand development.\nKey emotional \nchanges\nProbable effects on \nbehaviour\nWays for positive growth \nand development\nMood swings\nStrong emotions \nEngage in varied \nactivities like music, \ndance, or sports\nIncreased sensitivity \nSelf-exploration and involvement \nin activities that may lead to \ncreativity and innovation \nAny other\nTable 6.2: Emotional changes, their probable effects on behaviour, and \nways for positive growth  and development\nCompassion, involvement in \nsocial work\nWhile discussing Table 6.2, you may have explored the \ndiverse behavioural changes in adolescents. This is because \nadolescence is often marked by stronger emotions than \nchildhood. These emotions might affect adolescents’ behaviour \nlike taking up/joining social initiatives to support the needy and \nthe disadvantaged, or developing deeper interest in new areas.\nUnderstanding how our emotions influence our behaviour \nand actions, can help us make better choices and respond to \nsituations thoughtfully.\nAdolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change\n6.4\t Making Adolescence a Joyful \nExperience\nThe journey of adolescence is a unique experience. Heightened \ncuriosity and excitement during this stage of life give adolescents \na new viewpoint towards almost everything around them. \nGood habits, thoughtful decisions, and small actions can have a \npowerful positive impact on the overall well-being of adolescents. \nLet us know about them!\n6.4.1 Meeting nutritional needs\nIn Grade 6 chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, \nyou learnt about the need for a healthy diet. Since adolescence is \na period of growth and development marked by several changes \nin the body, a nutritious diet is of utmost importance.\nFor proper growth, and to perform \nwell on the playground, we need \nproteins and carbohydrates!\nNot only that, we also need \nan adequate amount of fats, \nvitamins, and minerals as well!\nActivity 6.3: Let us list\nBased on the locally available foods, fill Table 6.3 with the healthy \nfood sources, nutrients present in them and how these nutrients \ncan help our growth and development. \nFood \nsources\nNutrients we get \nfrom them\nFunctions of these \nnutrients\nMilk, millets, curd, \ncheese, and paneer\n_________________\nCalcium, proteins, fats\n_________________\nProteins\n_________________\nTo help optimal bone \ngrowth _________________\nTo help in the formation \nof blood\nTo help proper growth, gain \nstrength, and improve levels \nof energy _________________\nSpinach, kidney beans, \nand dried fruits like \nraisins, and figs\nIron \n_________________\nTable 6.3:\t Food sources, nutrients present in them, and functions of \nthese nutrients\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nScience and Society\nAdolescents, especially girls, may sometimes suffer from \nblood-related health problem(s) because of a deficiency of \niron or vitamin B12 in the body.\n\t\n Find out about such health problem(s).\n\t\n How can we manage iron deficiency in our body?\n\t\n Find out about government schemes aimed to prevent \nsuch deficiencies.\nKnow a Scientist\nDorothy Hodgkin was a brilliant scientist who studied the \nstructure of vitamin B12. In 1964, she became the third \nwoman to win the Nobel Prize in the \nfield of chemistry. Did you know that \nvitamin B12 is required for the proper \nfunctioning of the human body? Like \nmost vitamins, it cannot be made in the \nhuman body and has to be obtained \nfrom the food we eat. Discuss the sources \nof vitamin B12 with your teacher.\n6.4.2 Personal hygiene\nBesides nutrition, personal hygiene is also crucially important during \nadolescence. Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits \nand the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections.\nFor girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation \nis essential for both comfort and health. Menstrual hygiene can \nbe maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and \nreusable cloth pads designed for this purpose.\nThe government also attempts to provide these products free \nof charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of \ngirls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure \nthe availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places \nto promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move \nforward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping \nin menstrual hygiene.\nIt is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly  by \nwrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This \nis to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness. \nThese days, biodegradable sanitary pads are also available that \nare environment-friendly.\nFig. 6.1: Sanitary pad\nAdolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change\nScience and Society\nTo support menstrual hygiene, the government has introduced \nseveral initiatives—\n\t\n Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS): Under this scheme by the \nGovernment of India, sanitary pads are provided free of charge \nor at a reduced price to adolescent girls in rural areas. Awareness \nprogrammes are also conducted to educate girls about menstrual \nhygiene and health.\n\t\n Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK): It aims to \nimprove the overall health of adolescents, including menstrual \nhealth and hygiene. It encourages peer education, where older \nstudents help younger ones learn about these topics.\n\t\n Suvidha Sanitary Napkin Initiative: Under this initiative, \nbiodegradable sanitary pads are provided at affordable prices \nthrough Jan Aushadhi Kendras. The initiative aims to improve access \nto menstrual hygiene products for women and adolescent girls.\n\t\n State-Level Initiatives: Various state governments have their \nown programmes, such as the ‘Shuchi Scheme’ in Karnataka \nand free sanitary napkin schemes in states like Tamil Nadu and \nOdisha. These programmes aim to distribute free sanitary pads in \ngovernment schools.\n6.4.3 Physical activities\nFig. 6.2: Physical activities for fitness\nRegular exercise and physical activities are also very important \nduring adolescence. Do you exercise regularly or participate in \ngames and sports? What kinds of exercises do you do? These \nactivities will keep your body and mind fit and healthy, build up \nyour stamina and boost your mood (Fig. 6.2).\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n6.4.4 Balanced social life\nWe all live in a society and interact with each other in our day-to-day \nlife. We should all be polite and respectful towards each other \n(Fig. 6.3). This helps create a favourable and safe environment.\nSince adolescence is a stage of life marked by new experiences \nand emotions, we must be thoughtful and responsible while \ninteracting with others — whether in person or through social \nmedia. This is the time adolescents may feel attracted to their \npeers, and mimic their behaviour. Today, they often interact \nwith each other online.\nFig. 6.3: Collaborative learning in action\nModern technologies have made online platforms \navailable for all to obtain information, make \nconnections, interact, and share information with \neach other. We should use these platforms responsibly \nfor the collective well-being of all. Sometimes, we, \nknowingly or unknowingly, use social media platforms \ncarelessly. Seeking guidance from elders and teachers \ncan help use these platforms positively.\nScience and Society\nCyberbullying involves the use of digital devices such as phones, \ncomputers, or online platforms to harass others by sending misleading \nmessages, spreading false rumours, or sharing personal information \nwithout consent (Fig. 6.4). However, if someone tries to bully you, it is \nimportant not to feel scared or helpless. Rather, handle it wisely and \nseek help from parents and teachers. \n\t\nAdditionally, you should be cautious when uploading any picture \nonline or sharing  personal information with strangers.\nFig. 6.4: Cyberbullying \nM\na\nk\ni\nn\ng\n f\nu\nn\nAdolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change\nActivity 6.4: Let us spread awareness\nWork in groups to design posters and pamphlets about various \naspects of responsible social media behaviour and paste them \nat designated places in the school.

Since adolescence is marked by curiosity and \nexcitement, adolescents might get influenced by such people and try \nthese substances.\nThese substances are not just harmful to physical and mental \nhealth but are also addictive. This means that once people start \nconsuming them, they develop a strong urge to take them again \nand again. Over time, they start using them regularly. This is called \nsubstance abuse.\n(a) Before\n(b) After\nLungs\nSay no to \naddictive \nsubstances the \nfirst time and \nevery time!\nSomeone who \nis addicted \ntoday, might \nhave started \nonce with ‘just \none time’!\n___________________\nFig. 6.5: Condition of the lungs before and after prolonged  \nexposure to bidi/cigarette smoke\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nUsing these substances can cause serious health problems, \nsuch as breathing difficulties, memory loss, and damage to the \nlungs (Fig. 6.5), depending on the substance. To stay healthy, it is \nimportant to completely avoid these substances and make healthy \nchoices instead. It is important to remain firm and confident in \nyour decision to say ‘NO’. \nThe first step to overcoming addiction is seeking help and \nsupport from family and friends, and talking to trusted people, \nsuch as parents or teachers. Counselling and medical advice can \nalso be helpful in handling such situations. Remember, your \nhealth and your future are in your hands — choose wisely! \nScience and Society\nNasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan\nThe Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan was launched by the Ministry \nof Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. It \nintends to reach out to the masses and spread awareness on the \nissue of avoiding substance abuse through active participation of \nthe youth, women, and the community. The special focus is on the \nprevention of substance abuse among early-age children. \nThe Government has launched a National De-addiction Helpline— \n14446, to deal with drug addiction and to help drug addicts.\n6.5 The ‘Why’ Question for Adolescence\nBut I wonder why these \nchanges occur at this stage \nof life!\nWe now understand the different \nchanges in adolescence and also know \nsome ways to handle it with a sense of \nresponsibility.\nMany changes in adolescence, including menstruation and \nother signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones — certain \nchemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial \nrole in regulating various aspects of growth and development, \ncontributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are \nproduced in different parts of the body and are released at an \nappropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some \nhormones influence mood and behaviour. \nAdolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change\nBy staying informed, seeking support and guidance when \nneeded, and making healthy decisions, you can build a strong \nfoundation for your life ahead.\nIn a Nutshell\n\t\n Adolescence is the period of change from childhood to \nadulthood. It generally begins around the age of 10 years \nand usually lasts until 19 years.\n\t\n Adolescence is marked by significant and characteristic \nphysical, biological, and emotional changes.\n\t\n Features that help to distinguish the male from the female \nbut are not directly involved in reproduction are called \nsecondary sexual characteristics.\n\t\n Puberty is the stage in which the body of a child undergoes \nobservable and internal changes to develop into an adult \ncapable of reproduction.\n\t\n Adolescence in girls is also marked by start of the menstrual \ncycle, during which there is a discharge of blood generally \nafter every 28–30 days, a process called menstruation. \nMenstruation begins at puberty and generally ends by the \nage of 45–55 years. \n\t\n Adolescents face several emotional and behavioural changes. \n\t\n Eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining good \npersonal hygiene, and participating in physical activities \nhelp adolescents to stay healthy. \n\t\n Addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, \nhave adverse effects on the body and mind. It is wise to say \n‘NO’ to these substances and stay away from them. \n\t\n Changes that take place in the body during adolescence are \nprimarily controlled by certain chemicals produced in the \nbody. These chemicals are called hormones.\n\t\n Proper guidance and awareness help adolescents manage \nphysical, emotional, and behavioural changes effectively.\nLet Us Enhance Our Learning\n1.\t Ramesh, an 11-year-old boy, developed a few pimples on \nhis face.

Palden shares his \nexperiences of visiting Kerala during the winter vacation. He \nsays that compared to Gangtok, winter in Kerala is comparatively \nwarm and humid. Both Pema and Palden are curious about why \nsome places are so cold and others quite hot. \nHearing them express their curiosity, their grandfather, a \nretired science teacher, says, “Kerala is closer to the equator than \nSikkim and it also has a long coastline, which results in warmer \nand more humid weather conditions”. Palden replies, “Yes, we \nlearnt in Grade 6 Science and Social Science that for us on the \nEarth, the Sun is the main source of heat and light, and around \nthe equator, the climate is generally hot”. \nAs they are talking, Pema is keenly observing her grandmother \ncooking thukpa (a traditional Sikkimese dish) in a large metal \npan. Pema asks, “Why are cooking utensils generally made of \nmetals?” Palden immediately responds that they had studied \nin the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-metals’ that such \nmaterials are good conductors of heat.\nHeat Transfer \nin Nature \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nHow does heat get \ntransferred in these \nmaterials?\nLet us perform an activity to learn why certain materials are \ngood conductors of heat.\n7.1 Conduction of Heat\nActivity 7.1: Let us experiment\nCaution — This activity should be carried out under the supervision of \na teacher or an adult.\nTable 7.1: Falling of pins\nReasons for what you \nobserved\nPrediction \nObservation\nPin falling ﬁ rst\nTake a strip of a metal, such as aluminium \nor iron, about 15 cm long. \nAttach four pins to the strip with the help \nof wax such that they are arranged at \nnearly equal distances (about 2 cm apart), \nas shown in Fig. 7.1. \nSecure the strip to a stand and label the \npins as I, II, III, and IV, as shown in Fig. 7.1. \n(If a stand is not available, place the strip \nbetween two bricks for support.)\nHeat the end of the strip that is away from \nthe stand with a candle or a spirit lamp. \nMetal \nstrip\nBurning \ncandle \nStand\nPin\nFig. 7.1: Heat transfer in a metal strip\nWhat will happen to the pins? Will they remain attached to \nthe strip or will they fall?\nPredict the order in which the pins will fall from the strip. \nRecord your observations in Table 7.1. \n Heat Transfer in Nature\nYou observed that the pin closest to the candle ﬂ ame (pin I) \nfalls ﬁ rst, followed by pins II, III, and IV. Why does pin I fall before \npin II? Why did all the pins not fall together? \nFrom your observations, what can you infer? Do you think \nthat heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the \nend that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and \napproaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here, \nthe transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the \ncolder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of \nan object to the colder part is called conduction. In this process, \nthe particle that gets heated, passes the heat on to its neighbour, \nand so on. However, the particles themselves do not move from \ntheir positions. \nMaterials like metals that allow heat to pass through them \neasily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are \ngood conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for \ncooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the \nprocess of conduction.\nIf we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place \nof a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can \nyou think of the reason for this based on our learning from the \nchapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-Metals’? \nMaterials such as glass and wood do not \nallow heat to pass through them easily and \nare poor conductors (insulators) of heat. \nClay and porcelain are also poor conductors \nof heat — that is why tea or coﬀ ee kept in \nsuch cups stays hot longer.\nList some materials around you and \nclassify them as good or poor conductors \nof heat in Table 7.2. \nTable 7.2: List of good or poor conductors of heat\nS.No.\nMaterial\nSteel\nGood conductor\n1.\n2.\nWood\nGood or Poor conductor of heat\nDoes your list include air?

As a result, we feel \nwarm. Similarly, air trapped between \nthe layers of clothing acts as a poor \nconductor of heat and keeps us warm. \nThe presence of air between two thin \nblankets is the reason why we prefer \nthem over one thick blanket to keep \nus warm (Fig. 7.2).\nIs it possible to construct houses that are not aﬀ ected much \nby the outside heat and cold? Houses constructed in places with \na very hot or cold climate often use the concept of heat transfer \nto keep them cool or warm.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nThe upper regions of the Himalayas, such as the Mori block of Uttarkashi \nin Uttarakhand, experience an extremely cold climate and heavy \nsnowfall during winters. Houses here are often built to stay warm \nduring winters, with walls made of two wooden layers ﬁ lled with cow \ndung and mud between them. As wood and mud are poor conductors \nof heat, they prevent heat loss and help in keeping the houses warm.\nT\ni\ns\nd\nd\no\nThere are houses with outer walls that are constructed using \nhollow bricks that keep them warm in winters and cool in \nsummers. This happens because the air that gets trapped in the \nhollow bricks is a poor conductor of heat.\nPema draws Palden’s attention to the \nrising smoke from the burning ﬁ rewood, \naround which they are sitting.\n7.2 Convection\nTo understand why smoke rises, let us perform an activity. \nWhy is the smoke \ngoing up?\nFig. 7.2: Air trapped between two thin blankets \nacts as an insulator\nAir\nActivity 7.2: Let us investigate\nTake two identical paper cups.\nHang them using threads of equal length in \nan inverted position on the two ends of a \nwooden stick, as shown in Fig. 7.3a.\nFig. 7.3(a): Initial set-up \nThread\nWooden \nstick\nPaper \ncup\n Heat Transfer in Nature\nNow, adjust the positions of the cups, \nso that the stick is horizontal.\nPlace a burning candle below one of \nthe cups (Fig. 7.3b). \nObserve what happens to the cup.\nRecord your observations in Table 7.3 \nand think of probable reasons.\nTable 7.3: Recording observations and probable reasons\nObservation about the cups\nProbable reasons for the observation\nYou observed that the cup under which the candle \nwas placed, rises up (Fig. 7.3b). Why is it so? The air \naround the candle ﬂ ame heats up. As the air in the \ncup warms up, it expands and occupies more space. \nAs a result, it becomes lighter and rises up. \nYou can experience the expansion of air on \nheating it by placing a partially inﬂ ated balloon in \nthe Sun (Fig. 7.4). After the air in the balloon gets \nheated, it expands and the balloon becomes larger. \nYou must have observed that when an incense \nstick (agarbatti) is burnt, smoke rises up. Smoke is a \nmixture of hot gases and tiny solid particles that are released \nwhen something burns. As it is warmer than the surrounding air, \nit rises up.\nLet us ﬁ nd out how heat transfer \ntakes place in liquids by performing \nthe following activity.\nActivity 7.3: Let us ﬁ nd out\nCaution— This activity should be carried out under the supervision of \na teacher or an adult.\nTake a 500 mL beaker, half-ﬁ lled with water as shown in \nFig. 7.5a.\nWith the help of a straw, place a grain of potassium \npermanganate at the centre of the beaker’s base (Fig. 7.5a).\nPlace a candle right below the centre of the base of the beaker.\nHow does heat transfer \ntake place in liquids? \nDo liquids also rise up \nwhen heated like air?\nf \nn\nFig. 7.4: An inﬂ ated \nballoon in the Sun\nInﬂ ated \nballoon\nFig. 7.3(b): Hot air rising up\nThread\nWooden \nstick\nPaper cup\nBurning \ncandle\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n7.2.1 Land and Sea Breeze\nPalden shares his experience of visiting a beach in Kerala during \nwinter vacation and says, “During the day, the sand or soil near \nthe beach is hotter than the water in the sea. However, at night, \nthe sand or soil is cooler than the water.” Pema replies, “Yes, \ndiﬀ erent objects get heated and cooled diﬀ erently.” \nLet us check how land and water get heated and cooled by \nperforming an activity. \nActivity 7.4: Let us investigate\nCaution— This activity should be carried out on a clear, \nsunny day under the supervision of a teacher or an adult.\nTake two identical bowls as shown in Fig. 7.6.\nFill one bowl halfway with soil and the other bowl \nhalfway with water. \nFix a laboratory thermometer in each bowl as \nshown in Fig. 7.6. Make sure that the bulbs of the \nthermometer are immersed in soil and water, and \ndo not touch the bottoms or the sides of the bowls.\nPlace the set-up in sunlight.\nFig. 7.6: Measurement of the \ntemperature of soil and water\nSoil\nStand\nWater\nThermometer\nObserve the movement of the coloured streak in the \nwater.\nAs you supply heat, a streak of colour starts moving \nup and then coming down from the sides (Fig. 7.5b).\nWhy does the streak of coloured water go up in the \nmiddle and come down from the sides? The water at the \nbottom of the beaker gets heated up and becomes hot. \nIt expands, becomes lighter, and rises. The water on the \nsides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier, \nand comes down to take the place of the rising water. \nThen, this water gets heated and in turn also rises.\nThis cycle continues until the entire volume of water \ngets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets \nheated through the actual movement of water particles. \nThis process of heat transfer is known as convection. It \nis because of convection that we see the movement of the \ncoloured streak inside the beaker.\nThus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated \nup by the process of convection. Here, heat transfer takes \nplace by the actual movement of particles of liquids and \ngases from one place to another. \nFig. 7.5(b): Demonstration of \nconvection in heated water\nFig. 7.5(a): Initial set-up \nfor demonstration \nStraw\nBeaker\nWater\nCandle\nColoured \nstreak\nBurning \ncandle\nTripod \nstand\n Heat Transfer in Nature\nDid the temperature rise by the same amount for both the \nsoil and the water at the same time?\nIf not, which one got heated faster?\nHow much was the rise in temperature of the soil and the \nwater in 20 minutes?\nAfter 20 minutes, you will ﬁ nd that the temperature of the \nsoil rises more than that of the water. This indicates that the soil \nheats up faster than water. \nDoes the soil also cool faster than water? After letting the soil \nand water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for \n20 minutes. You will observe that \nthe soil cools faster than water, \njust as it gets heated faster.\nPeople \nliving \nin \ncoastal \nareas experience an interesting \nphenomenon \ncaused \nby \nthe \nheating and cooling of land and \nwater at diﬀ erent rates. As the \nland gets heated faster than water \nduring the day, it causes warm \nair above the land to rise. This \ncauses cooler air to move from \nthe sea towards the land. This \nmovement of cooler air from the \nsea to the land is called sea breeze \n(Fig. 7.7a). Hence, in hot places, sea breeze relieves people from \nthe heat. That is why, windows of the houses in coastal areas are \nplaced facing the sea.\nWarm air\nCool sea breeze\nWarmer \nland\nCooler sea\nFig. 7.7(a): Sea breeze\nMeasure the temperature of soil and water every 5 minutes \nand record the data in Table 7.4.\nTable 7.4: Temperature of soil and water when heated\nS.No.\nTemperature of \nsoil (°C)\nTime (min)\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n10\n20\nTemperature of \nwater (°C) \nStudy the rise in temperature of soil and water.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nAt \nnight, \nthe \nprocess \nreverses. In the absence of \nsunlight, land cools down \nfaster than the water in the \nsea. As a result, the air above \nthe sea is warmer and rises \nup. Cooler air from the land \nthen moves towards the \nsea, creating a land breeze \n(Fig. 7.7b).\nThus, people living near \nthe seashore experience that \nthe direction of the wind \nreverses in the day and night. \n7.3 Radiation \nDo you remember when Pema and Palden were sitting around \nthe ﬁ replace? They felt warm.\nTheir grandfather tells them that the \nheat transfer, in this case, takes place \ndirectly from the ﬁ re (hot object) to us by a \nprocess known as radiation. The heat of the \nSun reaches us through this process. Heat \ntransfer by radiation does not require any medium. \nAll objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot \nutensil kept away from the ﬂ ame cools down after some time. \nWhat is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating \nheat to its surroundings.\nWhy is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured \nclothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during \nwinters? \nLight-coloured clothes reﬂ ect most of the heat that falls on \nthem, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing \nthem during summers. Dark surfaces, on the other hand, \nabsorb more heat, and therefore, we feel more comfortable \nwith dark-coloured clothes during winters. \nc\nw\nL\nt\nt\na\nDIVE\nEEPER\nI wonder how \nheat from the \nﬁ re reaches us?\nCool land \nbreeze\nCooler \nland \nWarm air\nWarmer sea \nFig. 7.7(b): Land breeze\n Heat Transfer in Nature\nThere are many examples in our daily life, where we can \nobserve conduction, convection, and radiation happening \ntogether.\nConsider the case of water being heated up, as \nshown in Fig. 7.8. Let us identify the various ways in \nwhich the pan and the water get heated up, as well \nas the warmth we feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot \npan. Heat is transferred from the ﬂ ame to the utensil \nby conduction. Subsequently, water in the utensil \ngets heated up by convection. The warmth that we \nfeel around the ﬂ ame and the hot utensil is due to \nradiation.\nLet us wrap up!\nFrom the activities, examples, and discussions so far, we ﬁ nd that \nthere are three processes by which heat gets transferred. These \nare conduction, convection, and radiation. \nIn conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives \nheat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so \non. The particles themselves do not move away from their \npositions.\nIn convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual \nmovement of particles. \nNote that in conduction and convection, a medium must be \npresent whose particles help in the transfer of heat. \nIn the case of radiation, heat travels from one place to \nanother and no material medium is required for its transfer.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nIn the upper reaches of the Himalayan \nregion, a traditional room heater locally \nknown as bukhari is used to keep rooms \nwarm during winters. It consists of an iron \nstove in which wood or charcoal is burnt. \nA long pipe attached to the upper part of \nthe heater serves as a chimney, venting \nout the smoke. Additionally, the bukhari\ncan be used for cooking, as its ﬂ at top \nprovides a platform for placing utensils. \nAll the three processes of heat transfer \nare involved when this device is used for \ncooking and warming up the room. \nn \ny\ns\nn\nt.\nof \ng \nri\np\ns.\nr\nr\nBukhari\nFig. 7.8: Heating water in a pan\nFig 7 8: Heating water in a pan\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nYou have learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that \nthe Sun is the main source of heat for the Earth. You have seen \nyour parents drying wet clothes on the clothesline at home. Wet \nclothes dry faster on a sunny day since the heat from the Sun \nmakes the evaporation of water faster. \nThus, heat from the Sun plays an important role in the \nevaporation of water, be it from clothes drying on a line or from \nwater bodies like oceans and lakes. Let us look at the phenomenon \nof water cycle to understand this in more detail.\n7.4 Water Cycle\ny\nYou have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, \nthat water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it ﬁ lls \nthe oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms \nsnow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar \nregions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the \nEarth’s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and \nice gets converted to water due to the Sun’s radiation and ﬂ ows \ndown as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is \nreplenished by fresh snow during winters. \nWater in the oceans, \nrivers, and lakes gets \nheated due to the Sun, and \nas a result, it evaporates \nas water vapour. Water \nalso \nevaporates \nfrom \ntrees and plants through \ntranspiration. \nWhen water vapour \nrises up, it cools down \nand condenses to form \nclouds. \nClouds \nbring \nrain, snow, and hail. \nThis process is called \nprecipitation. \nThe continuous movement of water — upward as water vapour \nand downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, \nand plants, and ﬁ nally returning to water bodies, is called water \ncycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and \nreplenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to \nconserve the total amount of water on the Earth. Rainwater that \nfalls on the surface of the Earth, ﬂ ows into ponds, lakes, rivers, \nand oceans or seeps into the ground.\nFig. 7.9: Water cycle\nSun\nEvaporation\nCondensation\nPrecipitation\nit\nTranspiration\n Heat Transfer in Nature\nYou may have seen people drawing water \nfrom wells or handpumps.

His predictions of seasonal rainfalls were based on factors, \nsuch as cloud formation, wind patterns, position of stars and the \nmoon, and other natural phenomena. \nK\nV\ns\nIn\nr\ns\nm\nHow does water \nseep through the \nsurface of the \nEarth?\nGravel\n2\nSand\nClay\nFig. 7.10: An activity to compare the ﬂ ow of \nwater through clay, sand and gravel\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nDo your ﬁ ndings match with your predictions?\nYou may have observed that water seeps fastest through \ngravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why \nis it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when \ncompared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep \nthrough the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps \nbeneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water \nseeping through soil and rocks is called inﬁ ltration. Water \ncan inﬁ ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and \nrock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11).\nThe water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces \nof sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface \nas groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and \nrocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers \n(Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or \ndrilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few \nmetres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending \non the location.\nFig. 7.12: Aquifer\nRain\nInﬁ ltration\nWell\nAquifer\nHowever, groundwater is not unlimited. The growing water \nrequirements of an increasing population have led to excessive \ngroundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover \nand increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited \nwater inﬁ ltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. \nTo address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used \nto replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that \ngroundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a \nsustainable groundwater supply. \nFig. 7.11: Water readily \nmoves, and is stored where \nspaces are wide, open and \nconnected\nOpen \nspaces\nGravel\nSoil\n Heat Transfer in Nature\nSince water scarcity makes life diﬃ  cult, people have \ndeveloped diﬀ erent ways to conserve water. For example, in \nLadakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve \nwater by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters.\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nIce Stupa\nDuring the spring season in \nLadakh, streams often dry \nup, leading to scarcity of \nwater as the heat from the \nSun’s radiation is not enough \nto melt the snow on the \nmountains. During winters, \nwater \nfrom \nmountain \nstreams is channeled down \nthrough underground pipes. \nThis water is then sprayed \ninto the cold air. As it falls, it \nfreezes due to extremely low \ntemperatures. \nThe ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped \nstructure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13. The ice stupa \nmelts slowly during spring, providing water for farming and other \nneeds throughout the summer.\nFig. 7.13: Ice stupa\nIn a Nutshell\nThere are three ways in which heat is transferred from one \nplace to another — conduction, convection, and radiation.\nThe process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object \nto a colder part is called conduction. In this process, particles \ndo not move from their positions.\nMaterials that allow heat to pass through them easily are \ncalled good conductors of heat.\nMaterials that do not allow heat to pass through them easily \nare called poor conductors (insulators) of heat.\nIn solids, heat is mainly transferred through the process of \nconduction.

However, in her school, the sports teacher \nonly used a special kind of watch called a ‘stopwatch’ for timing \nthe school races. She had noticed her mother wearing a watch on \nher wrist and her sister looking at her mobile phone when she \nneeded to check the time. Her uncle used a Braille watch and had \nrecently acquired a talking watch that announced the time at the \ntouch of a button. There was also a large clock on the wall near \nthe school entrance. Her thoughts turned to people in the ancient \npast, who did not have the modern gadgets we have today and \nshe wondered…\nMeasurement of \nTime and Motion\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\n8.1 Measurement of Time\nHumans got interested in keeping track of time long ago. They \nstarted noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves \nafter deﬁ nite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting \nof the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. \nThey started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. \nFirst, they devised calendars. A day was deﬁ ned by the cycle of \nrising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to ﬁ nd ways \nof knowing the time of day. \nHow \nwas \ntime \nmeasured when there \nwere no clocks and \nwatches?\nSo, they made many devices which \nhelped them to measure smaller intervals \nof time within a day. Some of these were \nsundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and \ncandle clocks. \nIn a sundial, time is determined with \nthe changing position of the shadow of an \nobject cast by the light of the Sun during \nthe day (Fig. 8.1).\nThe water clocks used the ﬂ ow of water \nout or into a vessel to measure time. In \none type, water ﬂ owed out from a vessel \nwhich had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a). In \nthe other type, there would be a bowl, with \na ﬁ ne hole at the bottom, which was \nﬂ oated on the surface of water (Fig. 8.2b). \nIt gradually ﬁ lled up in a ﬁ xed time and \nﬁ nally sank. Then, it was lifted up and \nﬂ oated again. \nIn an hourglass (Fig. 8.3), time was \nmeasured on the basis of the ﬂ ow of sand \nfrom one bulb to another.\nCandle clocks (Fig. 8.4) were candles \nwith markings that indicated the passage \nof time when burned.\nFig. 8.1 A sundial\nFig. 8.2 A water clock (a) Water flowing out-type \n(b) Floating bowl-type\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 8.4 A candle clock\nFig. 8.3 An hourglass\nMeasurement of Time and Motion\nShould we make a simple water clock?\nActivity 8.1: Let us construct\nTake a used transparent plastic  bottle (1/2 litre or larger) \nwith its cap.\nCut it into two, roughly in the middle as shown in Fig. 8.5a.\nUsing a drawing pin, make a small hole in the cap of the \nbottle (Fig. 8.5b).\nFig. 8.5: Making a simple water clock\n(b)\n(a)\n(c)\n(d)\n(a)\nPlace the upper part of the bottle in an inverted position over \nthe lower half (Fig. 8.5c).\nFill the upper part of the bottle with water.

Can you now guess how to use it? \nPour the water from the lower part back into the top part and \nwatch the level of water dripping into the lower part. Every time \nit touches a mark made by you, one more minute has passed.\nFASCINATING FACTS\nThe world’s largest stone sundial, \nthe Samrat Yantra, was built \naround 300 years ago at the Jantar \nMantar, \nin \nJaipur, \nRajasthan, \na UNESCO World Heritage site \nthat houses several astronomical \ninstruments. With its imposing \nheight of 27 metres, its shadow \nmoves at about 1 millimetre per \nsecond and falls on a scale ﬁ nely marked to measure time intervals as \nshort as 2 seconds. Like any sundial, it measures local or ‘solar time’, \nrequiring a correction to determine Indian Standard Time.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nFASCINATING FACTS\nIn ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water \nclocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement \nappears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised \nbetween the second century BCE – third century CE). An accurate \nexpression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was \ngiven by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water \nﬂ owing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, \nand some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very \naccurate because as water levels dropped, the ﬂ ow rate decreased. \nThis led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock \n(Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, ﬁ rst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then \nin several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly \nwith Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town \nsquares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, \nconch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was \nprogressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth \ncentury, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals.\nn\ny\nn\n,\ns\nh\nFig. 8.6: Huygens’ \nPendulum clock\nPendulum\nAs human civilisation advanced, and \nas people began to travel long distances, \nthe measurement of time became very \ncritical. This led to the development of \nincreasingly better mechanical devices \nfor the measurement of time, driven \nby weights, gears, and springs from the \nfourteenth century onwards. However, \nthe invention of the pendulum clock \nin the seventeenth century marked \na major breakthrough in mechanical \ntimekeeping.\nKNOW A SCIENTIST\nThe pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by \nChristiaan Huygens (1629 –1695). He was inspired by the investigations \nof pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642). It is said that once while \nsitting in a church, Galileo’s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended \nfrom the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse \nto measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for \neach swing. After experimenting with diﬀ erent pendulums, Galileo \nconcluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always \nthe same for a pendulum of a given length. \nChr\nof p\nsitti\nfrom\nto m\neac\ncon\nthe\nMeasurement of Time and Motion\n8.1.1 A simple pendulum\nA \nsimple \npendulum \nconsists \nof \na \nsmall \nmetallic ball (called the \nbob of the pendulum) \nsuspended from a rigid \nsupport by a long thread \nas shown in Fig. 8.7a.\nFig. 8.7 A simple pendulum\n(b)\nO\nA\nB\nExtreme \nposition\nExtreme \nposition\nMean \nposition\n(a)\nRigid \nsupport\nLong \nthread\nBob \nThe pendulum at rest is in its mean position. When the bob of \nthe pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts \noscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it \nrepeats its path after a ﬁ xed interval of time. \nThe pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when \nits bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme \nposition A, changes direction and moves to another extreme \nposition B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The \npendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves \nfrom one extreme position A to another extreme position B and \ncomes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete \none oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a \npendulum and measure its time period.\nActivity 8.2: Let us experiment\nCollect a piece of string around 150 cm long, a heavy metal \nball with hook/ a stone (bob), a stopwatch/ watch, and a ruler.\nTie the bob at one end of the string. \nFix the other end of the string to a rigid support such that the \nlength of the string in between support and bob is around \n100 cm. \nWait for the bob to come to rest. Your pendulum is now \nready.\nWe did an activity in the chapter \n‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ \nin the Grade 6 Science textbook \nCuriosity, where we observed the \noscillatory motion of an eraser hung \nwith a thread. Is the pendulum \nsimilar to that?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nGently hold the bob, move it slightly to one side and release \nit. Take care not to push the bob while releasing it and that \nthe string is taut. Is your pendulum now oscillating?\nUsing a watch, measure the time it takes for the pendulum \nto complete 10 oscillations. Record the time in Table 8.1.\nRepeat this activity 3–4 times.\nDivide the time taken for 10 oscillations by 10 to calculate\nthe time period of your pendulum. Note it down in Table 8.1. \nTable 8.1 Time period of a simple pendulum\nLength of the string = 100 cm\nS.No.\nTime taken for 10 oscillations \n(seconds)\n1.\n2.\n3.\nTime period \n(seconds)\nIs the time period of your pendulum almost the same every \ntime? What do you conclude from this observation? The time \nperiod of the pendulum is almost the same every time.\nTHINK LIKE A SCIENTIST!\nYou just did an important historical experiment which was ﬁ rst done \nby Galileo, except you used a watch to measure time in place of your \npulse beat. Suppose you were Galileo experimenting with pendulums, \nwhat all would you investigate? What questions could you ask? Would \nall pendulums have the same time period? How would you test this? \nRepeat Activity 8.2 using the same bob but with pendulums of two \nor three diﬀ erent lengths. Does the time period change? If so, how does \nthe length aﬀ ect it? If changing the length inﬂ uences the time period, \ndoes the bob’s mass also matter? Test this by repeating Activity 8.2 \nwith a ﬁ xed pendulum length but with bobs of diﬀ erent mass. Do you \nobserve any change?\nThe time period of a simple pendulum depends on its length but \nnot on the bob’s mass. All pendulums of the same length have the same \ntime period at a given location.\nor \nthe\ndo\nwit\nob\nno\ntim\nThe time period of a simple pendulum of a given length is \nconstant at a place. This property is used in the measurement of \ntime. \nMeasurement of Time and Motion\nAll clocks, old or modern, are based on some process repeating \ncontinuously, which can be used to mark equal intervals of time. \nModern clocks measure time using the same basic principle — \nperiodically repeating processes — but use tiny and very rapid \nvibrations either from a quartz crystal (quartz clocks) or from some \nspeciﬁ c atoms (atomic clocks). While Huygens’ early pendulum \nclocks could gain or lose 10 seconds each day, today’s atomic clocks \nare so precise that they lose only one second in millions of years! \nScientists are constantly searching for even better ways to measure \ntime with greater accuracy.\n— \nd\ne\nm\ns\nDIVE\nEEPER\nFig. 8.8: Some common clocks and watches\n8.1.2 SI unit of time\nThe SI unit of time is the second. Its symbol is s. The larger units \nof time are minute (min) and hour (h).\n60 s = 1 min\n60 min = 1 h\nUnits of time, such as second, minute, and hour begin with a \nlowercase letter, except at the beginning of a sentence. Their \nsymbols ‘s’, ‘min’, and ‘h’ are also written in lowercase letters \nand in singular. Note that a full stop is not written after the \nsymbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the time, \nalways leave a space between the number and the unit.

The time unit measured by this \nclock was called ghatika or ghati. It became the standard unit of time \nmeasurement and continued until the end of the nineteenth century. \nA 24-hour-long day was, thus, divided into 60 equal ghatis.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nIn today’s world, measuring tiny fractions of a second is very \nimportant! For example, in sports, timekeeping devices can \nrecord events down to one-hundredth or even one-thousandth of \na second (a millisecond) to determine the winners in a race. In \nmedicine, heart monitors like Electrocardiogram (ECG) machines \nmeasure the millisecond variations in heartbeats to detect health \nissues. In music, digital recordings capture sound thousands of \ntimes per second for smooth playback. Many devices use even \nshorter intervals, smartphones, and computers process signals \nin microseconds (one-millionth of a second), allowing them \nto operate very fast. Scientists continue to develop even more \nprecise time-measuring tools for space exploration, medicine, and \nadvanced science experiments. The faster and more accurate our \nclocks become, the more they help society in ways we may not \neven notice!\ne\nd\nr\nt \nFor races covering the same \ndistance, we can tell who was \nfaster by measuring time. But how \ncan we tell that when comparing \nraces for diﬀ erent distances?\n8.2 Slow or Fast\nWhat do we mean when we say something is moving fast or \nslow? Suppose you are watching a 100 metre race on a straight \ntrack. All the players begin from the starting line together but \nafter sometime they are not running together (Fig. 8.10). How do \nyou decide who is running faster amongst them? \nFig. 8.9: A wall clock\nActivity 8.3: Let us identify\nLook at the wall clock shown in Fig. 8.9 carefully. \nWhat is the smallest interval of time you can \nmeasure with it? \nOne second is the smallest interval of time that we can \nmeasure using this clock.\nMeasurement of Time and Motion\nFig. 8.10: Boys running a race on a straight track\nSomeone who is ahead of others at some instant of time, is \nrunning faster than them. Hence, someone who has covered \nmore distance within the same time is running faster.\nThe distances moved by objects in a given interval of time \ndecide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster \nrunner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the \nword ‘speed’. \n8.3 Speed\np\nBy comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a \nunit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The \nunit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call \nthe distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of \nthe object.\nHow can we determine the speed of an object? It can be \ncalculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object \nand the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total \ndistance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus,\nSpeed = Total distance covered\n \nTotal time taken\nWhat would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of \nlength and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of \nspeed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. \nSpeed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the \ndistance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is \nkilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nExample 8.1: Swati’s school is 3.6 km from her house.

Find the diﬀ erence to calculate the \ntime taken by the train to cover the distance till the next station.\nCalculate the speed of the train between the two stations and \nrecord it in Table 8.2.\nRepeat for 4–5 diﬀ erent types of trains (Passenger/ Express/ \nSuperfast).\nTable 8.2: Finding the speed of trains\nName of the railway station nearest to your place of stay \n____________________________.\nS.No.\nName of \nthe train\nName of \nthe next \nstation\nDistance till \nthe next station \n(km)\nTime taken \ntill the next \nstation (h)\nSpeed of the train \nbetween these two \nstations (km/h)\nMeasurement of Time and Motion\nCompare the speeds of the trains. Which is the fastest train? \nThe train which has covered the maximum distance in unit time \nis the fastest train, that is, the one with the highest speed. \n8.3.1 Relationship between speed, distance, \nand time\nWe already know how to calculate speed using \nSpeed = Total distance covered\n \nTotal time taken\nif the distance travelled and time taken for it are known to us.\nWe can write this equation in a diﬀ erent form to calculate the \ndistance covered by an object, if we know its speed and the time \ntaken, by using \nTotal distance covered = Speed × Total time taken\nSimilarly, we can also calculate the time an object will take to \ncover a distance, if the distance and speed are given, by using\nTotal time taken = Total distance covered\n \n       \n \n      Speed\nExample 8.2: Raghav is going to a neighbouring city in a bus \nmoving at a speed of 50 km/h. If it takes him 2 h to reach that \ncity, how far is that city?\nSolution: Distance covered by bus = Speed × Time\n                                                               = 50 km\nh ×2h\n                                                              = 100 km\nExample 8.3: A train is travelling at a speed of 90 km/h. How \nmuch time will it take to cover a distance of 360 km? \nSolution: Time taken by the train = Distance covered\nSpeed\n                                                             = \n360km\n90 km\nh\n                                                             = 4 h\nIn all the examples so far, we have found the speed of an \nobject by using ‘the total distance covered divided by the total \ntime taken’. However, the object might not have travelled with \nthe same speed during the entire duration of time. The object \nmight have sometimes moved slower or sometimes faster. So, the \nspeed that we have calculated is the average speed, but, in this \nbook, we have used the term ‘speed’ for ‘average speed’. \nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nI once watched a part of marathon on a straight \nroad stretch. I noticed that some people seemed to \nbe running at the same speed during that distance \nwhile some people would speed up or slow down. \nHow were their motion diﬀ erent?\n8.4 Uniform and Non-uniform Linear Motion\nDo you remember learning about linear motion in the chapter \n‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ in the Grade 6 Science \ntextbook Curiosity? When an object moves along a straight line, \nits motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a \ntrack which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway \nstations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is \nan example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the \nﬁ rst station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then \nslows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between \nthe two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a \nconstant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed. \nFig. 8.11: A train on a straight track\nA\nB\nC\nD\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nVehicles \nsuch \nas \nscooters, \nmotorbikes, cars, and buses have \nan instrument which measures and \ndisplays the vehicle’s speed in km/h. \nIt is called a speedometer. Another \ninstrument, known as an odometer, \nis also ﬁ tted in the vehicles that \nmeasures the distance travelled by \nthe vehicle in kilometre.\nI\ni\ni\nm\nt\nSpeedometer\nOdometer\nMeasurement of Time and Motion\nAn object moving along a straight line with a constant speed \nis said to be in uniform linear motion. So, the train is in uniform \nmotion between B and C (Fig. 8.11). On the other hand, if the speed \nof an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said \nto be in non-uniform linear motion. The motion of the train \nbetween A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform \n(Fig. 8.11).\nAn object in uniform linear motion covers equal distances \nin equal intervals of time, while it covers unequal distances in \nequal intervals of times when it is in non-uniform linear motion. \nIn Table 8.3, data are given for the distances travelled by two \ntrains, X and Y, between the time 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.\nTable 8.3:  Distances travelled by two trains in equal time intervals \nof 10 minutes\nTime\n(AM)\nPosition \n(km)\nTrain X\nDistance \n(km)\nPosition \n(km)\nTrain Y\nDistance \n(km)\n10:00\n0\n0\n10:10\n20\n20\n10:20\n20\n15\n10:30\n20\n15\n10:40\n20\n25\n10:50\n20\n20\n11:00\n20\n25\nWhich of the two trains is in uniform linear motion between \n10:00 AM and 11:00 AM? Train X covers equal distances in equal \nintervals of time, so it is in uniform linear motion while Train Y \nis in non-uniform linear motion.\nUniform linear motion is an idealisation. In everyday life, \nwe seldom ﬁ nd objects moving with a constant speed over long \ndistances or for long intervals of time. That is why we have to use \naverage speeds.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\ny |\n|\nENQUIRY\nWHAT IF\nW\nH\nE\nN\nW\nH\nI\nC\nH\nH\nO\nW\nL\nO\nN\nG\nW\nHAT\nELSE\nWHY\nWHERE\nWHAT\nCOULD\nCAN \nIT\n?\nWHOSE\nWHAT WILL\nHAPPEN\nWHAT \nSHOULD\nWHY \nNOT\n?\nIn a Nutshell\nThe time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation \nis called its time period.\nThe time period of a simple pendulum of a given length is \nconstant at a place. \nThe SI unit of time is the second.

In this chapter, we will learn about life \nprocesses such as nutrition and respiration in detail.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nObserve your surroundings and notice what animals eat. \nAnimals eat diﬀ erent types of food. Bees and sunbirds suck the nectar \nof ﬂ owers, while infants of humans and many other animals feed on \ntheir mother’s milk. Snakes, like python, swallow the animals they \nprey upon. Some aquatic animals ﬁ lter tiny food particles ﬂ oating \nnearby and feed upon them. \nAnimals, \nincluding \nhumans, \nobtain \nenergy from food, which enables them to \ncarry out various life processes. Animals \nconsume \nfood \nthat \ncontains \ncomplex \ncomponents, such as carbohydrate, protein, \nand fat. These complex food components \nhave to be broken down into simpler forms \nbefore the body can use them. But how does \nthis process happen? \nBreaking \ndown \nof \ncomplex \nfood \ncomponents into simpler forms occurs in a \nlong tube called the alimentary canal. This \nprocess starts in the mouth and ends at the \nanus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this \ncanal, digestive juices secreted at diﬀ erent \nparts break it down into simpler forms. \nThis simpler form of food is absorbed by \ndiﬀ erent parts of our alimentary canal and \ntransported to various parts of our body to \ncarry out various functions.\n9.1 Nutrition in Animals  \nHow do the complex food components get broken down into \nsimpler forms and used by the body in various animals? Is this \nprocess the same in all animals or does it vary? Let us ﬁ rst try to \nunderstand this process in humans.\n9.1.1 Digestion in human beings\nLet us trace the journey of food inside our body as it passes \nthrough diﬀ erent parts of the alimentary canal.\nBeginning with the mouth cavity\nThe journey of the food you eat begins when it enters your \nmouth. Your teeth break down food you eat into smaller pieces \nby the processes of crushing and chewing. This process of initial \nbreakdown of food into ﬁ ne pieces is called mechanical digestion. \nThink about your favourite food.

At ﬁ rst, the chapati\nor rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you \nnotice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you \never wondered why this happens?\nChapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. \nOur saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch \ninto sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes \nsweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break \ndown components of food into simpler ones.\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nA healthy mouth requires good oral hygiene.

In Grade 6, we \nlearned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with \nstarch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour \nindicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains \nchewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates \nthat the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight \nchange in colour, it indicates that starch is present only in very \nsmall amount. It has been broken down into simple sugars by \nthe action of saliva. If the colour still appears in test tube B, what \nchanges would you make in the activity to explore it further? \nWould the colour change if chewing time is increased? Try to \nﬁ nd out by repeating the activity.\nNow, we know that saliva secretion in the mouth helps break \ndown starch into sugars. This process of breaking complex food \ncomponents into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food \nis partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially \ndigested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal. \nFood pipe (Oesophagus): A passage from the mouth to the \nstomach\nWhen you chew your food, your \nsaliva not only helps in digesting \nthe starch but also moistens \nit, making it soft and easy to \nswallow. Your tongue helps in \nmixing chewed food with saliva \nand pushing this softened food \ninto a long, ﬂ exible tube called \nthe food pipe or oesophagus\n(Fig. 9.2). But how does the food \nmove down? \nThe walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a \nwave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This \nmovement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and \npushes the food forward.\nStomach\nIn the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The \nchurned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining \nof the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice, \nacid, and mucus. \nFig. 9.2: Movement of food in the food pipe\nSite of \nrelaxation\nStomach\nStomach\nFood\nFood\nFood\nSite of contraction\nLife Processes in Animals\nThe digestive juice of the stomach breaks \ndown proteins present in the food into simpler \ncomponents. \nThe acid not only helps break down proteins \nbut also kills many harmful bacteria. The mucus \nprotects the stomach lining from the acid, preventing \ndamage. In the stomach, the food is partially digested \nand transformed into a semi-liquid mass, preparing \nit for the next stage of digestion. \nFig. 9.3: Stomach\nDigestive juice, \nacid and mucus\nStomach wall\nFASCINATING FACTS\nHow did scientists learn about digestion in the human body?\nThe discovery of how the stomach works happened \nby chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin \nwas accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated \nby a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound \nnever fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole. \nThis opening allowed Dr. Beaumont to observe \ndigestion in the stomach as it happened. He conducted \nexperiments on how diﬀ erent foods were broken \ndown and studied how emotions aﬀ ect digestion.\nAlexis St. Martin’s \nshotgun wound\nSmall Intestine\nAfter its journey through the stomach, the partially \ndigested food moves into the small intestine. Look \nat Fig. 9.4. It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary \ncanal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised \nthat although it is called small intestine, it is almost \n6 metres long—almost twice the height of your \nclassroom! You will be surprised to know that the \nsmall intestine is the longest part of the alimentary \ncanal. \nThe small intestine receives digestive secretions \nfrom three sources—the inner lining of the small \nintestine itself, and two more structures associated \nwith the alimentary canal—the liver and the \npancreas (Fig. 9.4). The liver secretes bile, which \nis mildly basic in nature. Recall the neutralisation \nreaction in chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, \nBasic, and Neutral’. Bile neutralises acids present \nin the food moving down from the stomach and \nbreaks down fats into tiny droplets, making its \ndigestion easier. \nStomach\nMouth\nFood pipe\n(Oesophagus)\nPancreas\nSmall \nintestine\nLiver\nLarge \nintestine\nAnus\nFig. 9.4: Alimentary canal if it is \nstretched out\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nThe pancreas secretes pancreatic juice, which is also \nbasic in nature and helps neutralise acids present in the food. \nAdditionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates, \nproteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the \nsmall intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially \ndigested carbohydrates into simpler forms. \nThe digested nutrients pass on \nfrom the small intestine into the blood \npresent in blood vessels found in the \nwalls of the small intestine. This process \nis called absorption of nutrients. How \nare these nutrients absorbed from \nthe small intestine? The inner lining \nof the small intestine is thin and has \nthousands of ﬁ nger-like projections \n(Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface \narea for eﬃ  cient nutrient absorption. \nThese ﬁ nger-like projections allow \nthe digested nutrients to pass into the \nblood, which carries them to diﬀ erent parts of the body. These \nnutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help \nthe body function properly. \nFig. 9.5: Inner lining of the small intestine \n0.5 mm\nLarge intestine\nAfter most of the nutrients are digested and absorbed in the \nsmall intestine, what happens to the undigested food? It moves \ninto the large intestine. The large intestine is about 1.5 metres \nin length. It is shorter than the small intestine. Then why is it \ncalled the large intestine? The reason is that it is wider than the \nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nCeliac disease is a condition in which the body reacts \nto gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. \nThis reaction damages the inner lining of the small \nintestine, where nutrients are absorbed. As a result, \nthe intestine cannot function properly. The only way \nto manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain \ngluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good \nalternatives because they are naturally gluten-free.\nLife Processes in Animals\nsmall intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and some salts \nfrom the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This \nsemi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the \nlower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the \nbody is ready to get rid of it. Eating ﬁ bre-rich foods like fruits, \nvegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function \nproperly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled \nthrough the anus—a process known as egestion. This is how your \nbody removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy!\nIsn’t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing \nnutrients from food and eliminating waste?\nFASCINATING FACTS\nThe large intestine contains various small living organisms, \nsuch as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our \ndigestive system healthy. They break down undigested food, \nespecially ﬁ bre, and produce essential nutrients. Fibre-rich \nfood, and especially ‘fermented foods’ (like curd, buttermilk, \nshrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for \na healthy digestive system and overall well-being.\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nThe importance of digestion in maintaining good health has been \nrecognised for centuries. The  Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic \ntext, highlights the role of easily digestible foods and the judicious use \nof spices like ginger, black pepper, and cumin to enhance digestion. \nAdvances in science in the area of nutrition also emphasise eating \nmeals at proper timings, practising mindful eating, and avoiding \novereating as key factors in maintaining digestive health.\n9.1.2  Do all animals digest food the same way as \nhumans do?\nI have seen cows keep chewing \nthe food even when they are \nnot actively grazing or eating \nanything. Why?\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nGrass-eating animals, such as \ncows (Fig. 9.6) and buﬀ aloes, \npartially \nchew \nthe \ngrass \nand swallow it into their \nstomachs. In the stomach, \npartial digestion of the food \ntakes place. The partially \ndigested food is brought back \nto the mouth for gradual \nchewing. \nThis \nprocess \nis \ncalled rumination, and these \nanimals are called ruminants. \nA cow spends about 8 hours a \nday just chewing the food! The \nthoroughly chewed food again \npasses down the alimentary \ncanal for further digestion. \nFig. 9.6: Digestive system of a ruminant \nOesophagus\nSmall Intestine\nRumen\nPancreas\nFig. 9.7: Digestive system in birds\nFig 9 7: Digestive system in b\nGizzard\nIntestine\nStomach\nOesophagus\nBirds do not have teeth, \nbut they have a chamber \ncalled a gizzard (Fig. 9.7). \nFood is broken down by the \ncontraction and relaxation \nof the walls of the gizzard, \noften with the help of grit \n(small stones) that the birds \nswallow.\nThis shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure \nand function of the alimentary canal to adapt to diﬀ erent ways \nof digesting diﬀ erent kinds of food. \nWe have learnt that the nutrients from digested food are \ncarried to diﬀ erent parts of the body. Some of the nutrients help \nbuild and repair the body, while others, like sugar, are broken \ndown inside the body to release energy. The process by which \nnutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration. \nLet us now explore how this process occurs in animals.\n9.2 Respiration in Animals\np\nWe learnt in Grade 6 chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their \nCharacteristics’, that all living beings respire. Is the process of \nrespiration the same in all animals? Let us ﬁ rst understand the \nprocess of respiration in humans.\nLife Processes in Animals\n9.2.1 Respiration in humans\nYou know that we breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale) air \ncontinuously to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. How \nis this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration \ndiﬀ erent? Let us ﬁ nd out. \nHow do we breathe?\nThe process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing. It is \ndiﬃ  cult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or \ntwo, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a \nfew minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not \njust humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we \nbreathe? \nJust as food follows a speciﬁ c pathway in the digestive system, \nour body also has a speciﬁ c system for breathing and respiration. \nThis system is called respiratory system. The respiratory \nsystem consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this \nsystem, the exchange of gases follows a speciﬁ c pathway. The \npathway through which the air is inhaled and exhaled involves \nvarious parts of the respiratory system assisting in the process of \nbreathing and respiration.\nThe respiratory system begins with a pair \nof nasal openings called nostrils through \nwhich we inhale and exhale air (Fig. 9.8). \nThe inhaled air passes into a pair of small \npassages called the nasal passages. Have \nyou noticed tiny hair inside your nostrils? \nThese hair, along with mucus, help trap \ndust and dirt from the air we breathe in. \nThis is why we should breathe through the \nnose and not through the mouth. From the \nnasal passages, the air reaches our lungs \nthrough the windpipe. The windpipe forms \ntwo branches, which enter the two lungs. \nIn the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and \nﬁ ner branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli \n(Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage. \nRib cage\nLeft lung\nRight lung\nDiaphragm\nWindpipe\nAlveoli\nNostrils\nFig. 9.8: Human respiratory system\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nWhile a lot of the dust is ﬁ ltered out from the inhaled air, often \nsmall infectious particles can get through the lungs. For example, \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus aﬀ ected \nthe respiratory system, leading to breathing diﬃ  culties and \noften causing serious lung problems.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nLet us understand the mechanism of breathing by making a \nsimple model.\nActivity 9.2: Let us make a model \nTake a wide transparent plastic \nbottle with a lid. Remove its \nbottom. \nMake a hole in the lid of the bottle. \nTake a Y-shaped hollow tube, as \nshown in Fig. 9.9. \nFix two deﬂ ated balloons to the \nforked end of the tube. Secure \nthem with rubber bands to make \nthem airtight. \nInsert the straight end of the tube \ntightly through the lid from the \nopen base of the bottle and seal \nthe lid with clay to make it airtight. \nTo the open base of the bottle, attach a thin rubber sheet \ntightly using a large rubber band.\nPull the rubber sheet from the centre of the base downwards \nand watch the balloons (Fig. 9.9a). What do you observe? Now, \nrelease the rubber sheet upwards and observe the balloons \n(Fig. 9.9b). What changes do you see in the balloons? When you \npull the rubber sheet downwards, the balloons inﬂ ate. Conversely, \nwhen you release the rubber sheet upwards, the balloons deﬂ ate.\nWhen \nyou \nbreathe \nin \n(inhale), \nyour \nchest \nexpands as the ribs move \nup \nand \noutwards. \nThe \ndiaphragm (a dome-shaped \nmuscle below the lungs) \nmoves downwards during \ninhalation (Fig. 9.10a). This \nincreases the space inside \nthe chest, and air enters the \nlungs. When you breathe \nout (exhale), the ribs move \ndown and inwards, and the \ndiaphragm moves upwards \n(Fig. 9.10b), reducing space \nand pushing air out of \nthe lungs. \nDiaphragm moves downward\n(a) Inhalation\n(b) Exhalation\nDiaphragm moves upward\nFig. 9.10: Mechanism of breathing \nAir is drawn in \nRibs move \noutwards\nRibs move\nback\nAir is forced out\n(a) Inhalation\n(b) Exhalation\nFig. 9.9: Model to show \nmechanisms of breathing\nLife Processes in Animals\nWhat do the balloons in the model mentioned in Fig. 9.9 \nrepresent? What does the rubber sheet represent? In this model, \nthe balloons represent the lungs, and the rubber sheet represents \nthe diaphragm.\nFig. 9.11: (a) Air is passed into lime water with a \npichkari/syringe (b) Air is exhaled into lime water\nPichkari\nStraw\nTest tube A \ncontaining \nlime water\nTest tube B \ncontaining\nlime water\n(a)\n(b)\nStraw\nWhat do we breathe out?\nActivity 9.3: Let us explore\nTo be demonstrated by the teacher \nTake an equal amount of freshly \nprepared lime water in two \ntest tubes, A and B, as given in \nFig. 9.11.\nIn test tube A, pass the air using \na syringe/pichkari (Fig. 9.11a). \nThis is the same air that you \ninhale.\nIn test tube B, repeatedly blow \nair through your mouth into \nthe lime water using a straw \n(Fig. 9.11b).\nDo you observe any changes in the colour of the lime water? \nThe lime water in test tube B turns milky (or cloudy), but the lime \nwater in test tube A does not. What does this indicate? Lime water \nturns milky when it reacts with carbon dioxide. Therefore, this \nindicates that the exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than \nthe air we inhale.\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nBreathing Practices for a Healthy Life\nBreathing exercises have been practised across diﬀ erent cultures \nin India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for \nimproving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration. \nIn Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing, \na technique that improves lung function and \nhelps keep the body warm even in cold weather. \nSimilarly, deep breathing techniques are used to \npromote well-being. Some traditions combine deep \nbreathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath \ncontrol to enhance relaxation and mental clarity.\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nHow does the exchange of gases \nhappen?\nThrough the process of breathing, \nfresh air from outside enters the \nlungs and ﬁ lls the alveoli. The alveoli \nhave thin walls surrounded by ﬁ ne \ntubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). \nBlood carries carbon dioxide from \nthe body to the alveoli, where it is \nreleased into the air. At the same \ntime, oxygen from the alveoli passes \ninto the blood and is transported to \nall parts of the body. \nHave you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you \nenergy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we \nbreathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple \nsubstances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose \nto release energy. This process is called respiration. The word \nequation of the process of respiration is as follows—\nGlucose + Oxygen \n Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy\nDuring \nbreathing, \nwe \ninhale \nair \nfrom \nour surroundings and \nexhale air having more \ncarbon \ndioxide \nthan \nthe inhaled air. Note \nthat not all the oxygen \nis used up (Fig. 9.13). \nSome \nother \nanimals \ncan \nuse \na \nlarger \nfraction of the oxygen \nduring \nrespiration. \nThis exchange of gases \nensures \nthat \neach \nsegment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove \nwaste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and \nremoves carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break \ndown food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, \nplay, and even think!\nBreathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical \nprocess that occurs inside the body.

This system is called the circulatory \nsystem. It includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The heart \npumps blood through blood vessels, ensuring the transport of \nnutrients, oxygen, and other substances to all parts of the body, \nwhile waste products are carried away. \np\ny\nSCIENCE AND SOCIETY\nSmoking is extremely harmful to health. It damages the lungs and \nincreases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and \nother respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and \nfrequent infections.\n In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic \nchemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers \ninhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which \ncan be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and \nthe elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both \npersonal health and the well-being of those around us.\n9.2.2  Do other animals breathe the same way as \nhumans do?\nYou have learnt that diﬀ erent animals \nlive in diﬀ erent habitats. You may have \nobserved birds ﬂ ying and ﬁ sh swimming. \nHow do they breathe? Animals, such \nas birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats, \nlizards, and snakes, breathe through \ntheir lungs. Although all these animals \nhave lungs, the structure of their lungs \nare quite diﬀ erent. Most aquatic animals \nlike ﬁ sh, have specialised structures \nknown as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are \nrichly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and \ncarbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in \nwater takes place across the gills. \nAmphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water. They \nuse diﬀ erent body parts for breathing at various stages of their \nlife. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs \nuse lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when \nthey stay in water. This adaptation helps them survive both in \nwater and on land, showing how animals have adapted over time \nto diﬀ erent environments. Earthworms use their moist skin for \nthe exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. \nGills\nFig. 9.14: Breathing body parts in a ﬁ sh\nCuriosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7\nThus, diﬀ erent animals have diﬀ erent breathing mechanisms \nto suit their unique habitats. Apart from the digestive system, the \nrespiratory system, and the circulatory system, there are other \nsystems which work in coordination with each other in the body \nand perform diﬀ erent functions to sustain life. You will study \nabout them in higher grades.\nIn a Nutshell\nLife processes such as nutrition, circulation, respiration, \nexcretion, and reproduction are essential for the survival \nof living beings. These processes are collectively called life \nprocesses.\nThe human digestive system consists of an alimentary canal \nwhich includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small \nintestine, large intestine, and anus, and its associated parts, \nthe liver and the pancreas. \nThe digested food is primarily absorbed through the walls of \nthe small intestine. \nThe  nutrients absorbed are distributed through the blood \nto diﬀ erent parts of the body where they are used for \nperforming various functions. \nThe large intestine absorbs most of the remaining water and \nsome salts from the undigested food.\nGrass-eating animals such as cows and goats are called \nruminants. They chew the food partially and swallow it. \nLater, the partially digested food is returned to the mouth, \nand the animal chews it thoroughly. \nBreathing involves the movement of air into the lungs \n(inhalation) and out of the lungs (exhalation).\nThe exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the \nalveoli of the lungs.\nRespiration uses oxygen from inhaled air to break down \nglucose into carbon dioxide and water. The process by which \nnutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration.\nThe circulatory system transports nutrients  and oxygen to \nall parts of the body. It includes the heart, which  pumps \nblood through blood vessels, delivering oxygen and nutrients \nwhile also removing waste from the body.\nBreathing is a physical process and respiration is a chemical \nprocess.\nDiﬀ erent animals have diﬀ erent breathing mechanisms \nadapted to suit their habitats.\nLife Processes in Animals\nENQUIRY\nWHAT IF\nW\nH\nE\nN\nW\nH\nI\nC\nH\nH\nO\nW\nL\nO\nN\nG\nW\nHAT\nELSE\nWHY\nWHERE\nWHAT\nCOULD\nCAN \nIT\n?\nWHOSE\nWHAT WILL\nHAPPEN\nWHAT \nSHOULD\nWHY \nNOT\n?\nLet Us Enhance Our Learning\n1.

Her son Khoisnam \nand their 99 relatives were invited to the reading of her will. She wanted \nto leave all of her ratnas to her son, but she knew that if she did so, all \ntheir relatives would pester Khoisnam forever. She hoped that she had \ntaught him everything he needed to know about solving puzzles. She left \nthe following note in her will—\n“I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it at the same time, you \nwill share the ratnas equally. However, if you are the first one to solve the \nproblem, you will get to keep the entire inheritance to yourself. Good luck.”\nThe minister took Khoisnam and his 99 relatives to a secret room in \nthe mansion containing 100 lockers.\nThe minister explained— “Each person is assigned a number from 1 to \n100. \n•\t Person 1 opens every locker.\n•\t \u0007Person 2 toggles every 2nd locker (i.e., closes it if it is open, opens \nit if it is closed).\n•\t Person 3 toggles every 3rd locker (3rd, 6th, 9th, … and so on).\n•\t Person 4 toggles every 4th locker (4th, 8th, 12th, … and so on).\nThis continues until all 100 get their turn.\nIn the end, only some lockers remain open. The open lockers reveal \nthe code to the fortune in the safe.”\nBefore the process begins, Khoisnam realises that he \nalready knows which lockers will be open at the end. \nHow did he figure out the answer?\nHint: Find out how many times each locker is toggled. \nA SQUARE AND A CUBE\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nIf a locker is toggled an odd number of times, it will be open. Otherwise, \nit will be closed. The number of times a locker is toggled is the same as \nthe number of factors of the locker number. For example, for locker #6, \nPerson 1 opens it, Person 2 closes it, Person 3 opens it and Person 6 closes \nit. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are factors of 6. If \nthe number of factors is even, the locker will be \ntoggled by an even number of people and it will \neventually be closed.\nNote that each factor of a number has a \n‛partner factor’ so that the product of the pair \nof factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and \n6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3 \nform another pair.\nDoes every number have an even number of factors?\nWe see in some cases, like 2 × 2, that the numbers in the pair are the \nsame.\nCan you use this insight to find more numbers with an odd number of \nfactors?\nFor instance, 36 has a factor pair 6 × 6 where both numbers are 6. \nDoes this number have an odd number of factors? If every factor of 36 \nother than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure \nthat 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true.\nHence all the following numbers have an odd number of factors —\n1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, ... \nA number that can be expressed as the product of a number with \nitself is called a square number, or simply a square. The only numbers \nthat have an odd number of factors are the squares, because they each \nhave one factor which, when multiplied by itself, equals the number. \nTherefore, every locker whose number is a square will remain open.\n6:\n1 × 6\n2 × 3\nFactors are\n1, 2, 3 and 6.\n1:\n1 × 1\nThe only factor \nis 1.\n4:\n1 × 4\n2 × 2\nFactors are \n1, 2 and 4.\n9:\n1 × 9\n3 × 3\nFactors are \n1, 3 and 9.\nA Square and A Cube\nWrite the locker numbers that remain open.\n1.1 Square Numbers\nWhy are the numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, …, called squares? We know that the \nnumber of unit squares in a square (the area of a square) is the product \nof its sides. The table below gives the areas of squares with different \nsides.\nWe use the following notation for squares.\n1 × 1 = 12 = 1 \n2 × 2 = 22 = 4 \n3 × 3 = 32 = 9, \n4 × 4 = 42 = 16 \n5 × 5 = 52 = 25.\n...\nIn general, for any number n, we write n × n = n2, which is read as ‛n squared’.\nCan we have a square of sidelength 3\n5 or 2.5 units? \nYes, there area in square units are ( 3\n5)\n2 = ( 3\n5) × ( 3\n5) = ( 9\n25), \nand (2.5)\n2 = (2.5) × (2.5) = 6.25.\nKhoisnam immediately collects word clues from these 10 lockers and \nreads, “The passcode consists of the first five locker numbers that \nwere touched exactly twice.”\nWhich are these five lockers?\nThe lockers that are toggled twice are the prime numbers, since each \nprime number has 1 and the number itself as factors.

None of them end with 2, 3, 7 or 8.\nIf a number ends in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9, is it always a square?\nThe numbers 16 and 36 are both squares with 6 in the units place. \nHowever, 26, whose units digit is also 6, is not a square. Therefore, we \ncannot determine if a number is a square just by looking at the digit in \nthe units place. But, the units digit can tell us when a number is not a \nsquare. If a number ends with 2, 3, 7, or 8, then we can definitely say that \nit is not a square.\nWrite 5 numbers such that you can determine by looking at their units \ndigit that they are not squares.\nThe squares, 12, 92, 112, 192, 212, and 292, all have 1 in their units place. \nWrite the next two squares. Notice that if a number has 1 or 9 in the \nunits place, then its square ends in 1.\nLet us consider square numbers ending in 6: 16 = 42, 36 = 62, 196 = 142, \n256 = 162, 576 = 242, and 676 = 262. \nMath \nTalk\nMath \nTalk\nA Square and A Cube\nWhich of the following numbers have the digit 6 in the units place?\n\t\n(i)  382\t\n (ii)  342\t   (iii)  462\t   (iv)  562\t    (v)  742\t   (vi)  822\nFind more such patterns by observing the numbers and their squares \nfrom the table you filled earlier.\nConsider the following numbers and their squares.\nIf a number contains 3 zeros at the end, how many zeros will its square \nhave at the end?\nWhat do you notice about the number of zeros at the end of a number \nand the number of zeros at the end of its square?

Alternatively, \nevery square is a sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1.\nAlso, we can find out whether a number is a perfect square by \nsuccessively subtracting odd numbers. Consider the number 25, \nsuccessively subtract 1, 3, 5, ... until you get or cross over 0, \nThis means 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 and is thus a perfect square. Since we \nsubtracted the first five odd numbers, 25 = 52.\nUsing the pattern above, find 362, given that 352 = 1225. \nFrom the question we know that 1225 is the sum of the first 35 odd \nnumbers. To find 362, we need to add the 36th odd number to 1225. \nHow do we find the 36th odd number?\nThe 1st odd number is 1, 2nd odd number is 3, 3rd number is 5, …, 6th \nodd number is 11 and so on. \nWhat is the nth odd number?\nThe nth odd number is 2n–1.\nTherefore, the 36th odd number is 71. \nBy adding 71 to 1225, we get 1296, which is 362.\nConsider a number such as 38 that is not a square and subtract \nconsecutive odd numbers starting from 1.\nThis shows that 38 cannot be expressed as a sum of consecutive odd \nnumbers starting with 1. \n1 + 3\n1 + 3 + (3 + 2)\n1 + 3 + 5\n1 + 3 + 5 + (5 + 2)\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7\nIn mathematics, sometimes arguments and reasoning can be \npresented without any words.

We can use this result to find out whether a natural number is a \nperfect square.\nFind how many numbers lie between two consecutive perfect squares. \nDo you notice a pattern? \nHow many square numbers are there between 1 and 100?

So, 8 is the square root of 64. What about \n– 8 × – 8 ? That is 64 too!\n82 = 64, and (– 8)2 = 64.\nSo, the square roots of 64 are + 8 and – 8.\nEvery perfect square has two integer square roots. One is positive and \nthe other is negative. The square root of a number is denoted by \nThus, \n8\n=±  and 100\n=±\n. \nNote that 8\n2 =±  and 10\n2 =±\n. In general, \nn\nn\n2 =±\n.\nIn this chapter, we shall only consider the positive square root.\nGiven a number, such as 576 or 327, how do we find out if it is a \nperfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square \nroot?\nWe know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even \nnumber of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this \ncondition is a square.\nWe can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we \ncannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square.\n1.\t We can list all the square numbers in sequence and find out \nwhether 576 occurs among them. We know that 202 = 400, we can \nfind squares of 21, 22, 23, … and so on until we get 576 or a number \ngreater than 576.\n202 = 400    212 = 441    222 = 484    232 = 529    242 = 576\n\t\n\u0007However, this process becomes inefficient for larger numbers.\n2.\t Recall that every square can be expressed as a sum of consecutive \nodd numbers starting from 1.\n  Consider 81.\n  \u0007\t\nFrom 81, we successively subtracted consecutive odd numbers \nstarting from 1 until we obtained 0 at the 9th step.

Will looking at a number’s prime factorisation help in \ndetermining whether it is a perfect square?\n\u0007\t\nYes, if we can divide the prime factors of a number into two \nequal groups, then the product of the prime factors in either group \ncombine to form the square root. \nIs 324 a perfect square?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.\nThese can be grouped as \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n324 = (2 × 3 × 3) × (2 × 3 × 3).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n= (2 × 3 × 3)2 = 182.\nWe can also write the prime factors in pairs. That is,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n324 = (2 × 2) × (3 × 3) × (3 × 3), \nwhich shows that 324 is a perfect square. Thus,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n324 = (2×3×3)2 = 182.\n\t\n Therefore, 324  =18. \nIs 156 a perfect square? \nThe prime factorisation of 156 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 13.\nWe cannot pair up these factors. \nTherefore, 156 is not a perfect square.\nFind whether 1156 and 2800 are perfect squares using prime factorisation.\nWe can estimate the square root of larger perfect squares by looking \nat the closest perfect squares we are familiar with and then narrowing \ndown the interval to search.\nFor example, to find 1936 , we can reason as follows:\n\t (i)\t\n1936 is between 1600 (402) and 2500 (502), so 40 < 1936  < 50.\n\t(ii)\t\nThe last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root \nmust either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46. \n(iii)\t If we calculate 452, we can compare it with 1936 to halve \nthe interval to search from 40–50 to either 40–45 or 45–50. \nWe can write 452 as (40 + 5) (40 + 5) = 402 + 2 × 40 × 5 + 52\n= 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025.\n\t(iv)\t 2025 > 1936. So, 40 < 1936  < 45\n\t(v)\t\nFrom the observation in point b we can guess and then verify \nthat 1936  is 44.\nConsider the following situations —\nAribam and Bijou play a game. One says a number and the other \nreplies with its square root. Aribam starts. He says 25, and Bijou quickly \nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nresponds with 5. Then Bijou says 81, and Aribam answers 9. The game \ngoes on till Aribam says 250. Bijou is not able to answer because 250 \nis not a perfect square. Aribam asks Bijou if he can at least provide a \nnumber that is close to the square root of 250.\nFor this, Bijou needs to estimate the square root of 250.\nWe know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100  = 10 and \n400  = 20.\nSo, 10 < \n250  < 20.\nBut, we are still not very close to the number whose square is 250.\nWe know that 152 = 225 and 162 = 256.\nTherefore, 15 < \n250  < 16. Since 256 is much closer to 250 than 225,\n250  is approximately 16. We also know it is less than 16.\nHere is another problem that requires estimating square roots.\nAkhil has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm2.

Hardy had ridden in a taxicab numbered 1729 and \nhe remarked that 1729 was ‘rather a dull number,’ \nadding that he hoped that this was not a bad sign. \nRamanujan immediately replied, “No, Hardy, it is a \nvery interesting number. It is the smallest number \nthat can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two \ndifferent ways”. \n1729 = 13 + 123 \n           = 93 + 103.\nBecause of this story, 1729 has since been known as the Hardy–\nRamanujan Number.

The fourth power was called varga-varga . These terms \nwere used in India at least from the third century BCE.\nAryabhata (499 CE) states\n“A square figure of four equal sides and the number representing its area \nare called varga. The product of two equal quantities is also called varga.”\nThus, the term varga for square power has its origin in the graphical \nrepresentation of a square figure. \nWhy is the word ‘root’ (the root of a plant) used for the mathematical \noperation √ (square root, cube root, etc.)?\nIt is because, in ancient India, the Sanskrit word mula, meaning \nroot of a plant, basis, cause, origin, etc., was used for the mathematical \noperations of taking roots.\nIn Sanskrit, varga-mula (the basis, cause, origin of the square) was \nused for square-root and ghana-mula was used for cube-root. This use of \nmula for the mathematical concept of root was subsequently emulated \nin Arabic and Latin through their corresponding words for the root of \na plant — jidhr and radix respectively. The term mula for root has been \nused in India at least from the first century BCE.  Another term used was \npada (foot, basis, cause, origin). Brahmagupta (628 CE) explains, ‘The \npada (root) of a krti (square) is that of which it is a square.’\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Find the cube roots of 27000 and 10648.\n2.\t What number will you multiply by 1323 to make it a cube number?\n3.\t State true or false.

For example,\n47561 = (4 × 10000) + (7 × 1000) + (5 × 100) + (6 × 10) + 1.\nThis can be written using powers of 10 as\n(4 × 104) + (7 × 103) + (5 × 102) + (6 × 101) + (1 × 100).\nWrite these numbers in the same way: (i) 172, (ii) 5642, (iii) 6374.\nHow can we write 561.903?\n561.903 = (5 × 100) + (6 × 10) + 1 + (9 × 1\n10) + (0 × 1\n100) + (3 × \n1000).\nWriting it using powers of 10, we have\n561.903 = (5 × 102) + (6 × 101) + (1 × 100) + (9 × 10–1) + (0 × 10–2) + (3 × 10–3).\n343\n2401\n49\n7\n76\n74\n72\n70\n7–1\n7–2\n7–3\n7–4\n117649\n2401\n49\n1\nPower Play\nScientific Notation\nLet’s look at some facts involving large numbers —\n(i)\t The Sun is located 30,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 m from the \ncentre of our Milky Way galaxy.\n(ii)\t The number of stars in our galaxy is 1,00,00,00,00,000.\n(iii)\t The mass of the Earth is 59,76,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 kg.\nAs the number of digits increases, it becomes difficult to read the \nnumbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place \ncommas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting \n₹5,000 when you were supposed to get ₹50,000. The number of zeroes is \nmore important than the initial digits in several cases.\nCan we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very \nlarge numbers correctly?\nFor example, the number 5900 can be expressed as —\n5900 = 590 × 10 = 590 × 101 \n     = 59 × 100 = 59 × 102\n       = 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103\n              = 0.59 × 10000 = 0.59 × 104.\nAny number can be written as the product of a number between \n1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example,\n\t\n5900 = 5.9 × 103 \t\n\t\n20800 = 2.08 × 104\t\n80,00,000 = 8 × 106\nWrite the large-number facts we read just before in this form.\nIn scientific notation or scientific form (also called standard form), \nwe write numbers as x × 10 y, where x ≥ 1 and x < 10 is the coefficient and \ny, the exponent, is any integer. Often, the exponent y is more important \nthan the coefficient x. When we write the 2 crore population of Mumbai \nas 2 × 107, the 7 is more important than the 2. Indeed, if the 2 is changed \nto 3, the population increases by one-half, i.e., 2 crore to 3 crore, whereas \nif the 7 is changed to 8, the change in population is 10 times, i.e., 2 crores \nto 20 crores. Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the \nexponent, which indicates the number of digits.\nIf we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the \nimpression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units \nplace. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned \nabout how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value. If \nwe are only sure that the population is around 1 lakh 42 thousand, we \ncan write it as 1.42 × 105. If we can only be certain that it is around 1 lakh \n40 thousand, we write it as 1.4 × 105. The number of digits in the coefficient \nreflects how well we know the number. The most important part of any \nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nnumber written in scientific form is the exponent, and then the first \ndigit of the coefficient. The digits following the coefficient are small \ncorrections to the first digit.\nThese values are rounded-off estimates, averages, or approximations; \nmost of the time, they serve the purpose at hand.\nThe distance between the Sun and Saturn is 14,33,50,00,00,000 m \n= 1.4335 × 1012 m.\nThe distance between Saturn and Uranus is 14,39,00,00,00,000 m \n= 1.439 × 1012 m.

Let us continue this journey.\nNanjundappa wants to donate jaggery equal to Roxie’s weight and \nwheat equal to Estu’s weight. He is wondering how much it would cost.\nWhat would be the worth (in rupees) of the donated jaggery? What \nwould be the worth (in rupees) of the donated wheat?\nIn order to find out, let us first describe the relationships among the \nquantities present.\nWorth of jaggery (in rupees) = Roxie’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg jaggery. \nWorth of wheat (in rupees) = Estu’s weight in kg × cost of 1 kg wheat.\nMake necessary and reasonable assumptions for the unknowns and find \nthe answers. Remember, Roxie is 13 years old and Estu is 11 years old.\nAssuming Roxie’s weight to be 45 kg and the cost of 1 kg of jaggery to be \n₹70, the worth of donated jaggery is 45 × 70 = ₹3150. Assuming Estu’s \nweight to be 50 kg and the cost of 1 kg of wheat to be ₹50, the worth of \ndonated wheat is 50 × 50 = ₹2500.\nRoxie wonders, “Instead of jaggery if we use 1-rupee coins, how many \ncoins are needed to equal my weight?”. How can we find out?\nFor questions like these, you can consider following the steps suggested \nbelow.\n1.\t Guessing: Make an instinctive (quick) guess of what the answer could \nbe, without any calculations.\nThe practice of offering goods equal to the weight of a person, called \nTulābhāra or Tulābhāram, is quite old and is still followed in many \nplaces in Southern India. It is a symbol of bhakti (surrendering oneself), \na token of gratitude; it also supports the community.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \n2.\t Calculating using estimation and approximation —\n(i)\t Describe the relationships among the quantities that are needed \nto find the answer.\n(ii)\t Make reasonable assumptions and approximations if the required \ninformation is not available.\n(iii)\t Compute and find the answer (and check how close your guess \nwas).\nWould the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or \neven more? Make an instinctive guess.\nFind the answer by making necessary and \nreasonable assumptions and approximations for \nthe unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for \nan exact answer but a reasonably close estimate.\nEstu asks, “What if we use 5-rupee coins or 10-rupee notes instead? \nHow much money could it be?”\nMake an instinctive guess first. Then find out (make necessary and \nreasonable assumptions about the unknown details and find the \nanswers).\nEstu says, “When I become an adult, I would like to donate notebooks \nworth my weight every year”. Roxie says, “When I grow up, I would like \nto do annadāna (offering grains or meals) worth my weight every year”. \nHow many people might benefit from each of these offerings in a \nyear? Again, guess first before finding out.\nRoxie and Estu overheard someone saying — “We did pādayātra for \nabout 400 km to reach this place! We arrived early this morning.”\nHow long ago would they have started their journey?\nFind answers by making necessary assumptions and approximations. \nDo guess first before calculating to check how close your guess was!\nHow about measuring \nto find out the weight \nof a 1-rupee coin?\nInitially, your guesses may be very far off from the answer and \nit is perfectly fine! You will get better at it like as you do it often \nand in different situations. Guessing and estimating can build \nintuition about numbers and various quantities.\nMath \nTalk\nNote to the Teacher: Assumptions can vary greatly at times, and as a result the \nanswers computed using these you can also vary. This is perfectly alright. Modelling \nthe situation properly is crucial, which can also be done in different ways sometimes. \nThe accuracy of the assumed numbers or quantities can get better with exposure \nand practice.\nPower Play\nBefore the rise of modern transport, people moved from one place to \nanother by walking — sometimes merchants, sages, and scholars walked \nthousands of kilometres to different parts of the world across deserts, \nmountains, and rivers.\nHow many times can a person circumnavigate (go around the world) the \nEarth in their lifetime if they walk non-stop? Consider the distance around \nthe Earth as 40,000 km.\nLinear Growth vs. Exponential Growth\nRoxie tells Estu about a science-fiction novel she is reading where they \nbuild a ladder to reach \nthe moon, “... I wonder if \nwe actually had a ladder \nlike that, how many steps \nwould it have?”.\nWhat do you think? Make \nan instinctive guess first.\nWould the number of steps \nbe in thousands, lakhs, \ncrores, or even more? \nTo find out, we would \nneed to know the gap between consecutive steps of the ladder. Let’s \nassume a reasonable distance of 20 cm. Visualising the problem as shown,\nPādayātra, is the traditional practice of walking long distances as part \nof a religious or spiritual pursuit. People across religions in our country \nobserve similar forms of pilgrimage or spiritual walking, although they \nmay have different names or purposes.\nSome of the pilgrimages are Ajmer Sharif Dargah Ziyarat, \nPandharpur Wari, Kānwar Yatra, Sabarimala Yatra, Sammed \nShikharji Yatra, Lumbini to Sarnath Yatra.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nWe have to find out how many 20 cm make 3,84,400 km.\nIf we calculate the value, we get the result as 1,92,20,00,000 steps, which \nis 192 crore and 20 lakh steps or 1 billion 922 million steps. The fixed \nincrease in the distance from the earth with each step (a 20 cm gain after \neach step) is called linear growth. \nTo cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon, it takes \n1,92,20,00,000 steps with linear growth whereas it takes just 46 folds of \na piece of paper with exponential growth! Linear growth is additive, \nwhereas exponential growth is multiplicative.\n20 + 20 + 20 + …………\n1,92,20,00,000\ntimes   \n0.001 × 2 × 2 × 2 ………. \n46 times\nSome examples of exponential growth we have seen earlier in \nthis chapter are ‘The Stones that Shine’, ‘Magical Pond’, ‘How Many \nCombinations’. We shall explore more such interesting examples in a \nlater chapter and also in the next grade.\nCan you come up with some examples of linear growth and of \nexponential growth?\nGetting a Sense for Large Numbers\nLast year, we learnt about lakhs and crores, as well as millions and \nbillions. A lakh is 105 (1,00,000), a crore is 107 (1,00,00,000), and an arab \nis 109 (1,00,00,00,000), whereas a million is 106 (1,000,000) and a billion \nis 109 (1,000,000,000). \nYou might know the size of the world’s human population. Have you \never wondered how many ants there might be in the world or how long ago \nhumans emerged? In this section, we shall explore numbers significantly \nlarger than arabs and billions.

An anonymous Jaina treatise Amalasiddhi gives a \nlist with a name for each power of ten up to 1096 (dasha-ananta).

She \npicked it up and stared at the strange symbols all over it. “What is this?” \nshe wondered.\nShe ran to her father, holding the paper as if it were a secret treasure. \nHe looked at it and smiled. “Around 4000 years ago, there flourished a \ncivilisation in a region called Mesopotamia, in the western part of Asia, \ncontaining a major part of the present-day Iraq and a few other \nneighbouring countries. This is one of the ways they wrote their \nnumbers!”\nReema’s eyes lit up, “Seriously? These strange symbols were numbers?” \nHer curiosity was sparked, and questions started swirling in her head.\nSince \nwhen have \nhumans been \ncounting?\nWhat was their \nneed for counting? \nWhat were they \ncounting?\nSince when \nhave people \nbeen writing \nnumbers in \nthe modern \nform?\nHow would the \nMesopotamians  \nhave written \n20? 50? 100?\nA Story of Numbers\nSensing her curiosity, her father started telling her how the idea of \nnumber and number representation evolved over the course of time, \nacross geographies, to finally reach its modern efficient form. \nGet ready to travel back in time with them!\nHumans had the need to count even as early as the Stone \nAge. They were counting to determine the quantity of food \nthey had, the number of animals in their livestock, details \nregarding trades of goods, the number of offerings given in \nrituals, etc. They also wanted to keep track of the passing \ndays, e.g., to know and predict when important events such \nas the new moon, full moon, or onset of a season would occur. \nHowever, when they said or wrote down such numbers, they \ndidn’t make use of the numbers that we use today.\nThe structure of the modern oral and written numbers that we use \ntoday had its origin thousands of years ago in India. Ancient Indian texts, \nsuch as the Yajurveda Samhita, mentioned names of numbers based on \npowers of 10, almost as we say them orally today. For example, they listed \nnames for the numbers one (eka), ten (dasha), hundred (shata), thousand \n(sahasra), ten thousand (āyuta), etc., all the way up to 1012 and beyond.\nThe way we write our numbers today — using the digits 0 through 9 — \nalso originated and were developed in India, around 2000 years ago. The \nfirst known instance of numbers being \nwritten using ten digits, including the digit 0 \n(which was then notated as a dot), occurs in \nthe Bakhshali manuscript (c. 3rd century \nCE). Aryabhata (c. 499 CE) was the first \nmathematician to fully explain, and do \nelaborate scientific computations with the \nIndian system of 10 symbols.\nThe Indian number system was transmitted to the Arab world \nby around 800 CE. It was popularised in the Arab world by the great \nPersian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī (after whom the word ‘algorithm’ \nis named) through his book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals \n(c. 825) and by the noted philosopher Al-Kindi through his work On the \nUse of the Hindu Numerals (c. 830).\nFrom the Arab world, the Hindu numerals were transmitted to Europe \nand to parts of Africa by around 1100 CE. Though Al-Khwārizmī’s work \non calculation with Hindu numerals was translated into Latin, it was the \nItalian mathematician Fibonacci who around the year 1200 really made \nthe case to Europe to adopt the Indian numerals. However, the Roman \nnumerals were so ingrained in European thinking and writing at the \ntime that the Indian numerals did not gain widespread use for several \nmore centuries. But eventually, during the European Renaissance and \nby the 17th century, not adopting them became impossible or it would \nimpede scientific progress. \nZero in the Bakhshali manuscript\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \n“The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten \nsymbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in \nIndia. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound \nimportance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated \ncalculations and placed arithmetic foremost among useful inventions.”\n— Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749 – 1827)\nTheir use then spread to every continent, and are now used in every \ncorner of the world.\n Because European scholars learned the Indian numerals from the \nArab world, they called them ‛Arabic numerals’ to reflect their European \nperspective. On the other hand, as noted above, Arab scholars, such as \nAl-Khwārizmī and Al-Kindi, called them ‛Hindu numerals’. During the \nperiod of European colonisation, the European term Arabic numbers \nbecame widely used. However, in recent years, this mistake is being \ncorrected in many textbooks and documents around the world, including \nin Europe.  The most commonly used terminologies for the numbers we \nuse today are ‛Hindu numerals’, ‛Indian numerals’, and the transitional \n‛Hindu-Arabic numerals’. It is worth noting that the word ‛Hindu’ here \ndoes not refer to a religion, but rather a geography/people from whom \nthese numbers came.\nThe shape of the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 used to write numbers in the Indian \nnumber system today evolved over a period of time, as shown below:\nEvolution of the digits used in the Indian number system\nPrior to the global adoption of the Indian system of numerals, different \ngroups of people used different methods of representing numbers. We \nA Story of Numbers\nshall take a glimpse of some of them. We will not be looking at different \nsystems in a chronological order, but rather an order that shows us the \nmain stages in the development of the idea of number representation. \nBut first, let us explore some of the foundational ideas needed to count \nand to determine the number of objects in a given collection.\nThe Mechanism of Counting\nImagine that we are living in the Stone Age, say, around ten thousand \nyears ago. Suppose we have a herd of cows. Here are some natural \nquestions that we might ask about our herd —\nQ1.\t\u0007How do we ensure that all cows have returned safely after \ngrazing?\nQ2.\tDo we have fewer cows than our neighbour?\nQ3.\t \u0007If there are fewer, how many more cows would we need so \nthat we have the same number of cows as our neighbour?\nWe need to tackle these questions without the use of the \nnumber names or written numbers of the Hindu number \nsystem. How do we do it?\nHere are some possible methods.\nMethod 1: We could tackle the questions by using pebbles, sticks or \nany object that is available in abundance. Let us choose sticks. For every \ncow in the herd, we could keep a stick. The final collection of sticks tells \nus the number of cows, which can be used to check if any cows have \ngone missing.\nMath \nTalk\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nThis way of associating each cow with a stick, such that no two cows are \nassociated or mapped to the same stick is called a one-to-one mapping. \nThis mapping can then be used to come up with a way to represent \nnumbers, as shown in the table.\nNumber\nIts representation (using sticks)\n2\n4\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nHow will you use such sticks to answer the other two questions (Q2 and \nQ3)?\nMethod 2: Instead of objects, we could use a standard sequence of \nsounds or names. For example, we could use the sounds of the letters \nof any language. While counting, we could make a one-to-one mapping \nbetween the objects and the letters: that is, associate each object to be \ncounted with a letter, following the letter-order. This mapping can then \nbe used to come up with a way of verbally representing numbers.\nFor example, we get the following number representation if we use \nEnglish letters ‘a’ to ‘z’.\nNumber\nIts representation (using \nsounds or names)\n2\n4\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nz\nA Story of Numbers\nAn obvious limitation of using only the letters of the English alphabet \nin this form is that it cannot be used to count collections having more \nthan 26 objects.\nHow many numbers can you represent in this way using the sounds \nof the letters of your language?\nMethod 3: We could use a sequence of written symbols as follows.\nDo you see a way of extending this method to represent bigger numbers \nas well? How?\nFrom the discussion above, we see that for counting and finding the \nsize of a collection, we need a standard sequence of objects, or names, \nor written symbols, that has a fixed order. Let us call this standard \nsequence a number system. A collection of objects can be counted by \nmaking a one-to-one mapping between them and the standard sequence, \nfollowing the sequence order.\nSince there is no end to numbers, the challenge is to come up with \nan unending standard sequence/number system that is easy to count \nwith. Using sticks gives an unending standard sequence/number system. \nHowever, it is not convenient to count larger collections, as we will \nneed as many sticks as the number of objects being counted. Using the \nsounds of the letters of a language, as in Method 2, is convenient for \nthe counting process but is not an unending standard sequence/number \nsystem. The standard sequence/number system given in Method 3 was \nactually the system used in Europe before it got replaced by the Hindu \nnumber system. It is called the Roman number system. It was widely \nused in Europe for centuries, and was convenient for many purposes, \nbut had the similar drawback that one cannot write arbitrarily large \nnumbers without introducing more and more symbols. We will learn \nmore about this system of writing numbers later on. \nMath \nTalk\nNumber\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nRepresentation \nusing symbols\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\nVII\nVIII\nIX\nX\nNumber\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nRepresentation \nusing symbols\nXI\nXII\nXIII\nXIV\nXV\nXVI\nXVII\nXVIII\nXIX\nXX\nTable 1\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nAs illustrated by the three methods, history gives us examples of \nnumber systems formed using physical objects (such as sticks, pebbles, \nbody parts, etc.), names, and written symbols. Some groups of people \nhad numbers represented both by physical objects as well as by names, \nwhile others like the Chinese had all three forms of representation. The \nsymbols occurring in a written number system are called numerals. \nFor example, 0, 1, 5, 36, 193, etc., are some of the numerals occurring in \nthe Hindu number system. Numerals representing ‘smaller’ numbers \nalways had names, and so a number system composed of written \nsymbols always went hand in hand with a number system composed of \nnames, as is the case with the modern-day Hindu system. \nFigure it Out\n1.\t Suppose you are using the number system that uses sticks to \nrepresent numbers, as in Method 1. Without using either the \nnumber names or the numerals of the Hindu number system, \ngive a method for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing \ntwo numbers or two collections of sticks. \n2.\t One way of extending the number system in Method 2 is by \nusing strings with more than one letter — for example, we could \nuse ‘aa’ for 27.

Tally Marks on Bones and Other Surfaces\nOne of the oldest methods of number representation is by making \nnotches — marks cut on a surface such as a bone or a wall of a cave. \nThese marks are also called tally marks. \nIn this method, a mark is made for each object that is being counted. \nSo the final collection of marks represents the total number of objects. This \nmethod is very similar to the method of using sticks to count (Method 1), \nexcept for the fact that a mark is made instead of adding a stick.\nArchaeologists have discovered bones dating back more than 20,000 \nyears that seem to have tally marks. The oldest known such bones with \nmarkings that are thought to represent numbers are the Ishango bone \nand the Lebombo bone. The Ishango bone, dating back 20,000 to 35,000 \nyears, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It features \nnotches arranged in columns, possibly indicating calendrical systems. \nThe Lebombo bone, discovered in South Africa, is an even older tally \nstick with 29 notches, estimated to be around 44,000 years old. It is \nconsidered one of the oldest mathematical artefacts, and may have \nserved as a tally stick or lunar calendar. \nLebombo bone\nIshango bone\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nIII. Number Names Obtained by Counting in Twos\nA group of indigenous people in Australia called the Gumulgal had the \nfollowing words for their numbers.\nCan you see how their number names are formed?\nThe number name for 3 is composed of number names of 2 and 1.\nThe number name for 4 is composed of two occurrences of the number \nname for 2.\nCan you see how the names of the other numbers are formed?\nThe numbers are counted in 2s, using which the number names are \nformed: 3 = 2 + 1, 4 = 2 + 2, 5 = 2 + 2 + 1, 6 = 2 + 2 + 2.\nGumulgal called any number greater than 6 ras. \nThere is a very interesting and puzzling historical phenomenon \nassociated with this number system. Look at the following number \nsystems of a group of indigenous people in South America, and the \nBushmen of South Africa:\nGumulgal\n(Australia)\n1.\t urapon\n2.\t ukasar\n3.\t ukasar-urapon\n4.\t ukasar-ukasar\n5.\t ukasar-ukasar-urapon\n6.\t ukasar-ukasar-ukasar\nMap not to scale\nIndia\nGumulgal\nBushmen\nBakairi\n1\t -\ttokale\n2\t-\tahage\n3\t-\tahage tokale\n\t \t (or ahawao)\n4\t-\tahage ahage tokale\n5\t-\tahage ahage ahage\n1\t -\txa\n2\t-\tt'oa\n3\t-\t'quo\n4\t-\tt'oa-t'oa\n5\t-\tt'oa-t'oa-t'a\n6\t-\tt'oa-t'oa-t'oa\n1\t -\turapon\n2\t-\tukasar\n3\t-\tukasar-urapon\n4\t-\tukasar-ukasar\n5\t-\tukasar-ukasar-urapon\n6\t-\tukasar-ukasar-ukasar\nA Story of Numbers\nDespite being so far apart geographically, and with no trace of contact \nbetween them, these three groups have developed equivalent number \nsystems! Historians have wondered how this happened. One theory is \nthat these three groups of people may have had common ancestors, who \nused this number system. In course of time, their descendants migrated \nto these places. \nEven though the number system of Gumulgal had number names for \nnumbers only till 6, we can see the emergence of an idea here. Counting \nin 2s is more efficient for representing numbers than, for example, a tally \nsystem. A general form which this idea has taken in different number \nsystems is as follows: count in groups of a certain number (like 2 in the \ncase of Gumulgal’s system), and use the word or symbol associated with \nthis group size to represent bigger numbers. Some of the commonly \nused group sizes in different number systems have been 2, 5, 10 and 20.\nYou can find the idea of counting by 5s in the Roman system (Table 1).\nOne of the phenomena that could have led people to this idea might \nbe the human limit for immediately knowing the size of a collection at a \nglance. Let us try out the following activity.\nQuickly count the number of objects in each of the following boxes: \nUp to what group size could you immediately see the number of \nobjects without counting? Most humans find it difficult to count groups \nhaving 5 or more objects in a single glance.\nThis limit of perception could have prompted people using tally \nmarks to replace every group of, say, 5 marks, with a new symbol, \nas seen in the system shown in Table 1.\nThis idea of counting in a certain group size and using it to represent \nnumbers is an important idea in the history of the evolution of \nnumber systems. \nMath \nTalk\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nWhat could be the difficulties with using a number system that counts \nonly in groups of a single particular size? How would you represent a \nnumber like 1345 in a system that counts only by 5s?\nEven though counting in groups of a particular size and using it for \nnumber representation is more efficient than the tally system, this \nmethod can still become cumbersome for larger numbers. The next \nsystem shows a refinement of this idea.\nIV. The Roman Numerals\nWe have already seen the Roman number system till 20 (Table 1). We \nhave seen that it uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10.\nTo get the Roman numeral for any number till 39, it is first grouped \ninto as many 10s as possible, the remaining is grouped into as many 5s \nas possible, and finally the remaining is grouped into 1s. \nExample: Let us take the number 27.\n27 = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1\nSo, 27 in Roman numerals is XXVII.\nInstead of representing 50 as XXXXX, a new symbol is given to it: L. \nFollowing the way the number 4 is represented as 1 less than 5 — that \nis, as IV — 40 is represented as 10 less than 50 — that is, as XL. However, \npeople using this system were not always consistent with this practice. \nSometimes, 40 was also represented as XXXX.\nThe Roman number system introduces newer symbols to represent \ncertain bigger numbers. Let us call all these numbers that have a new \nbasic symbol as landmark numbers. Here are some of the landmark \nnumbers of the Roman system and their associated numerals.\nI\nV\nX\nL\nC\nD\nM\n5\n50\n500\n1,000\nA Story of Numbers\nThese symbols are used to denote other numbers as well. For example, \nconsider the number 2367. Writing it as a sum of landmark numbers \nstarting from 1000 such that we take as many 1000s as possible, 500s as \npossible, and so on, we get\n2367 = 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 50 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1\nSo in Roman numerals, this number is MMCCCLXII.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Represent the following numbers in the Roman system.\n(i) 1222      (ii) 2999      (iii) 302      (iv) 715\nWe see how vastly efficient this system is compared to some of the \nprevious number systems that we have seen. This system seems to have \nevolved out of the ancient Greek number system in around the 8th \ncentury BCE in Rome, and evolved over time. It spread throughout \nEurope with the expansion of the Roman empire.\nDespite the relative efficiency of the Roman system, it doesn’t lend \nitself to an easy performance of arithmetic operations, particularly \nmultiplication and division.\nExample: Try adding the following numbers without converting them \nto Hindu numerals:\n(a)\t CCXXXII + CCCCXIII\nLet us find the total number of Is, Xs, and Cs, and group them \nstarting from the largest landmark number.\nApparently, it looks like the largest landmark number is C, but \nnote that 5 Cs (100s) make a D (500). So the sum is\nThe efficiency of this system is due to the grouping of a given number \nby not just one group size, but a sequence of group sizes that we \ncall landmark numbers, and then using these landmark numbers \nto represent the given number. This idea is the next important \nbreakthrough in the history of the evolution of number systems.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nDo it yourself now:\n(b)\t LXXXVII + LXXVIII\nHow will you multiply two numbers given in Roman numerals, \nwithout converting them to Hindu numerals? Try to find the product \nof the following pairs of landmark numbers: V × L, L × D, V × D, \nVII × IX.\nMultiply \nCCXXXI and \nMDCCCLII\nPeople using the Roman system made use of a calculating tool called \nthe abacus to perform their arithmetic operations.

The Egyptian Number System\nWe are now going to see a written number system that the Egyptians \ndeveloped around 3000 BCE. In this system, we see the use of landmark \nnumbers to group and represent a given number. However, what makes \nthis system special is its sequence of landmark numbers.\nImagine making collections of pebbles. The first landmark number \nis 1. Group together 10 collections of the previous landmark number (1). \nIts size is the second landmark number which is 10. Group together 10 \ncollections of the previous landmark number (10). Its size is the third \nlandmark number which is 10 × 10 = 100, and so on.\nMath \nTalk\nTry\nThis\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nEach landmark number is 10 times the previous one. Since 1 is the \nfirst landmark number, they are all powers of 10. The following are the \nsymbols given to these numbers —\nAs in the case of Roman numbers, a given number is counted in groups \nof the landmark numbers, starting from the largest landmark number \nless than the given number. This is then used to assign the numeral.\nFor example 324 which equals 100 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 10 + 4 is written \nas \n.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Represent the following numbers in the Egyptian system: 10458, \n1023, 2660, 784, 1111, 70707.\n2.\t What numbers do these numerals stand for?\nII. \u0007Variations on the Egyptian System and the Notion of \nBase\nInstead of grouping together 10 collections of size equal to the previous \nlandmark number (as in the case of the Egyptian system), can we get \na number system by grouping together 5 collections of size equal to \nthe previous landmark number? Can this 5 be replaced by any positive \ninteger?\nLet us examine this possibility. Let 1 be the first landmark number.\nGroup together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark \nnumber (1). Its size is the second landmark number which is 5.\nGroup together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark \nnumber (5). Its size is the third landmark number which is 5 × 5 = 25.\nGroup together 5 collections of size equal to the previous landmark \nnumber (5). Its size is the fourth landmark number which is 5 × 25 = 125.\n(i)\n(ii)\nA Story of Numbers\nThus, we have a new number system where each landmark number \nis 5 times the previous one. Since 1 is the first landmark number, they \nare all powers of 5.\n50 = 1            51 = 5            52 = 25          53 = 125          54 = 625          55 = 3125\nExpress the number 143 in this new system.\nLet us start grouping, starting with the size 53 = 125, as this is the \nlargest landmark number smaller than 143. We get—\n143 = 125 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1.\nSo the number 143 in the new system is \n.\nNumber systems having landmark numbers in which the \n(a)\t first landmark number is 1, and\n(b)\t every next landmark number is obtained by multiplying the \ncurrent landmark number by some fixed number n is said to \nbe a base-n number system.\nThe Egyptian number system is a base-10 system, and the number \nsystem that we created is a base-5 system. A base-10 number system is \nalso called a decimal number system.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Write the following numbers in the above base-5 system using the \nsymbols in Table 2: 15, 50, 137, 293, 651.\n2.\t Is there a number that cannot be represented in our base-5 system \nabove?

To understand this, let us perform some arithmetic \noperations using them.\nExample: Add the following Egyptian numerals:\nLet us find the total number of | and  and group them starting from \nthe largest possible landmark number. It has a total of—\n15  and 15 |.\nSince 10  gives the next landmark number , the sum can be regrouped \nas—\nSum = \nA Story of Numbers\nSince 10| gives a  , we have\nSum = \nFigure it Out\n1.\t Add the following Egyptian numerals:\n(i) \n(ii)  \n2.\t Add the following numerals that are in the base-5 system that we \ncreated:\n  \u0007Remember that in this system, 5 times a landmark number gives the \nnext one!\n+\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nContrast the addition done in a base-n number system with that \ndone in the Roman system. In the Roman system, the grouping and \nrearranging has to be done carefully as it is not always by the same size \nthat each landmark number has to be grouped to get the next one.\nThe advantage of a number system with a base becomes more evident \nwhen we consider multiplication.\nHow to multiply two numbers in Egyptian numerals?\nLet us first consider the product of two landmark numbers.\n1. \t \u0007What is any landmark number multiplied by  (that is 10)?

For the same reason \nthat it holds for (a + b) × n, it also holds when one of the \nnumbers has more than 2 terms. For example, (a + b + c) × n = \nan + bn + cn. So, \n(  + \n + |) ×  = (  × ) + (\n × ) + (| × )\n=  + \n + \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n    =  \n \nMath \nTalk\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nNow find the following products —\n(i) \n(ii) \nWhat would be a simple rule to multiply a number with ?\nAs has been seen, a process of multiplying two numbers involves the \nmultiplication of landmark numbers. When the landmark numbers are \npowers of a number, then their product is another landmark number. \nThis fact simplifies the process of multiplication. However, this is not the \ncase with the Roman numerals, which is why multiplication using them \nis difficult.\nThus, a number system whose landmark numbers are powers of \na number, i.e., a number system with a base, is efficient not only in \nnumber representation but also in its utility in carrying out arithmetic \noperations.\nThe idea of a number system with a base was a turning point in the \nhistory of the evolution of number systems. Our modern Hindu number \nsystem is built on this structure.\nAbacus that Makes Use of the Decimal System\nIn around the 11th century, even the people still using the Roman \nnumerals started using a calculating device — the abacus — constructed \nusing a decimal system. It was a board with lines, as shown in the Fig. 3.1. \nStarting from the line that stood for 1, each successive line stood for a \nsuccessive power of 10. \nNumbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was \nfirst grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the \nsame way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as \nmany counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred \nFig. 3.1: Abacus\nA Story of Numbers\nin the grouping. The presence of a counter above a line contributed a \nvalue of 5. \nFor example let us take the number 3426. It can be grouped as \n\u00073426 = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 10 + 10+ 1 + 1 + \n1 + 1 + 1 + 1\nThis number was represented as shown in Fig. 3.1. Notice how the \n6 ones are represented.\nTo get an idea of how the abacus was used for calculations, let us \nconsider a simple addition problem: 2907 + 43. The two numbers were \ntaken on either side of the vertical partition. \nHow would you use this to find the sum?\nThe counters along each line were brought together. What is to be \ndone if the total in a line exceeded 10? \nHint: In this problem, the 7 ones and the 3 ones together make 10 ones \nwhich contributes a counter to the line representing 10s.\nIII. Shortcomings of the Egyptian System\nDespite being a number system that enabled relatively efficient number \nrepresentations for numbers till a crore (107), and relatively easy \ncomputations, the Egyptian system had a drawback.\nIf larger and larger numbers needed to be represented, then there \nwas a need for inventing an unending sequence of symbols for higher \nand higher powers of 10. Here we see the original challenge of number \nrepresentation resurfacing in a different form!\nThe next and the final idea in the history of the evolution of number \nsystems not only solves this problem but also remarkably simplifies \nnumber representation and computations!\nFigure it Out\n1.\t \tCan there be a number whose representation in Egyptian \nnumerals has one of the symbols occurring 10 or more times? \nWhy not?\nMath \nTalk\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \n2.\t Create your own number system of base 4, and represent \nnumbers from 1 to 16.\n3.\t Give a simple rule to multiply a given number by 5 in the base-5 \nsystem that we created. \n3.4. Place Value Representation\nI. The Mesopotamian Number System\nIn the beginning, the number system used in ancient Mesopotamia had \ndifferent symbols for different landmark numbers. In later times, it \nbecame a base-60 system, also called the sexagesimal system, with a \nvery efficient number representation.\nIt has puzzled many why they chose base 60. Different theories exist to \nexplain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of \nsome important events (like the length of their lunar month which had \n30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution around \nthe Earth when Earth is taken to be stationary), the ease of representing \nfractions (we will not go into this here), their earlier sequence of \nlandmark numbers — 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, 36000,… — getting reduced to \nonly the powers of 60, and so on.\nThe influence of the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system, also known \nas the Babylonian number system, can be seen even now in our units \nof time measurements — 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds.\nThis system used the symbol  for 1 and \n for 10.\nLet us now briefly pause on the study of their number system, and \nideate on how one can build an efficient number system using the \nMesopotamian features seen so far.\nMath \nTalk\nA Story of Numbers\nLet us give our own symbols to their landmark numbers —\nNote that we have actually used Indian numerals in creating these \nsymbols. We could have invented our own symbols but for the sake of \neasy recall and use, we have chosen to take help of the familiar numerals \n1, 2, 3, ...\nUsing  and \n, numbers from 1 to 59 can be represented —\nExample: Let us represent the number 640 in this system.\nGrouping it into landmark numbers, we see that\n640 = (10) × 60 + 40.\nIf we use the Egyptian idea, this number would be represented using \n10 \n1 s, and 40 would be represented using 4 \ns.\n1                 60              602 = 3600      603 = 216000 ... \n...\n3\n1            2             3             4             5              6              7               8              9\n10           11           12           20           30               40           50             59 \nReproduction of a Mesopotamian Tablet \nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nCan we represent this more compactly?\nWe can simply represent this number as\nwhich can be read as ten 60s and one 40, just as we have written in the \nequation.\nExample: Let us try another number — 7530.\n7530 = (2) ×3600 + (5) × 60 + 30\nSo, its representation would be\nNote that when a number is grouped into powers of 60 for its \nrepresentation, no power of 60 can occur 60 or more times. If this \nhappens, then 60 of them can be grouped to form the next power of 60. \nFor example, consider the expression —\n(1) × 3600 + (70) × 60 + 2\t = (1) × 602 + (60 + 10) × 60 + 2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n= (1) × 602 + 602 + (10) × 60 + 2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n= (2) × 602 + (10) × 60 + 2\nTherefore, any number can be represented using the numerals from \n1 – 59, along with the numerals for landmark numbers.\nNow, what if we make the representation even more compact by \ndropping the symbols for the different powers of 60 altogether?\nA Story of Numbers\nThis is exactly what the Mesopotamians did! In their numeral, the \nrightmost set of symbols showed the number of 1s, the set of symbols to \nits left showed the number of 60s, the next showed the number of 3600s \nand so on. Whenever there was no occurrence of a power of 60, a blank \nspace was given in that position.\nIt does not seem that the Mesopotamians arrived at this idea in the \nsame way we did. Some scholars suggest that the similarity of symbols \ngiven to the landmark numbers 1 and 60 in their earlier number system, \nand an accidental usage of them, might have made them stumble upon \nthis idea.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Represent the following numbers in the Mesopotamian system —\n(i) 63    (ii) 132    (iii) 200    (iv) 60    (v) 3605\nThus, we can see how the Mesopotamian system removes the need for \ngenerating an unending sequence of symbols for the landmark numbers \nby making use of the positions where the symbols are written. Such a \nnumber system (having a base) that makes use of the position of each \nsymbol in determining the landmark number that it is associated with is \ncalled a positional number system or a place value system.\nThis idea of place value marks the highest point in the history of \nevolution of number systems, and gives a very elegant solution to the \nproblem of representing the unending sequence of numbers using only \na finite number of different symbols!\nThe Mesopotamian system however cannot be considered a fully \ndeveloped place value system. It has certain defects that lead to confusion \nwhile reading a number.\nLook at the representation of 60. What will be the representation for \n3,600?\nWhile writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not \ngiven the way we are giving it here. It was also difficult to maintain a \nconsistent spacing for blanks across different manuscripts written by \ndifferent people. These created ambiguities. For example, consider the \nrepresentations of the following numbers —\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nBecause of the ambiguity in finding which symbols correspond to \nwhich powers of 60, the same numeral can be read in different ways. \nEven in our representation which uses uniform spacing between \nsymbols for different powers of 60, it is difficult to know the number of \nblanks between two sets of symbols, as in the representation of 36002. \nTo address the issue arising out of blank spaces, the later \nMesopotamians used a brilliant idea of assigning a ‘placeholder’ symbol \n to denote a blank space. This is like the 0 (zero) we use in our system. \nThus, zero — the symbol that shows nothingness — is indispensable as a \nplaceholder in a place value system in which numbers are written in an \nunambiguous manner. \nEven with the problem arising out of blank spaces solved, other \nambiguities still remained in the system. For example, the placeholder \nsymbol was primarily used in the middle of numbers and not at the \nend; so they would not use it to represent a number like (what we would \nwrite as) 3600.\nII. The Mayan Number System\nIn Central America, there flourished a civilisation known as the Mayan \ncivilisation that made great intellectual and cultural progress between \nthe 3rd and 10th centuries CE. Among their intellectual achievements \nstands their place value system designed independently of those in Asia. \nThey also made use of a placeholder symbol, for the modern-day ‘0’, that \nlooked like a seashell.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nHere we find a puzzling phenomenon. Why was their third landmark \nnumber 360 rather than 400? Some scholars feel that this might have \nsomething to do with their calendars.\nThey used a dot \n for 1, and a bar \n for 5. These were used to \ndenote numbers from 1 to 19. \nThe symbols associated with different landmark numbers were \nwritten one below the other with the lowermost set of symbols \ncorresponding to the number of 1s, the set above corresponding to the \nnumber of 20s, the set above to the number of 360s and so on. \nRepresent the following numbers using the Mayan system:\n(i) 77    (ii) 100    (iii) 361    (iv) 721\nBecause the Mayan system is not an actual base-20 system, it lacks the \nadvantages that a system with a base has for computations. Nevertheless, \ntheir place value notation and their use of a placeholder symbol for zero \nis considered an important advance in the history of number systems. \nA curious fact is that we can still find the use of base-20 in the number \nnames of some European languages.\nIII. The Chinese Number System\nThe Chinese used two number systems — a written system for recording \nquantities, and a system making use of rods for performing computations. \nThe numerals in the rod-based number system are called rod numerals. \nHere we discuss the rod numerals, which are more efficient in writing \nand computing with numbers than the written system of the Chinese. \nThe rod numerals developed in China by at least by 3rd century AD \nand were used till the 17th century. It was a decimal system (base-10). \nThe symbols for 1 to 9 were as follows: \nA Story of Numbers\nCHINESE NUMBER SYSTEM\nBase-10 or Decimal \n\u0007Note: The zongs represent units, hundreds, tens of thousands, etc., and the hengs tens, \nthousands, hundreds of thousands, etc.\nHow is this to be read?\n2 (Heng)\n6 (Zong)\n3 (Heng)\n4 (Zong)\nLandmark number \npositions\n102\n1\n=\n(2) × 103\n+ (6) × 10² +\n(3) × 10\n+\n(4) × 1\n=\nA numeral\nLike the Mesopotamians, the rod numerals used a blank space to \nindicate the skipping of a place value. However, because of the slightly \nmore uniform sizes of the symbols for one through nine, the blank \nspaces were easier to locate than in the Mesopotamian system. \nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nNotice how similar the rod numerals are to the Hindu system. \nThe Chinese system, with a symbol for zero, would be a fully developed \nplace value system. \nIV. The Hindu Number System\nWhere does the Hindu/Indian number system figure in the evolution of \nideas of number representation? What are its landmark numbers? And \ndoes it use a place value system?\nHindu Number System\nBase-10 or Decimal\nTen symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nA numeral    375\nHow is this to be read?\n7\nLandmark number positions\n=  (3) × 10² \n+\n(7) × 10 + \n(5) × 1\n10\n=\nAs can be seen, the Hindu number system is a place value system. \nThe Hindu number system has had a symbol for 0 at least as early as \n200 BCE. Because of the use of 0 as a digit, and the use of a single digit in \neach position, this system does not lead to any kind of ambiguity when \nA Story of Numbers\nreading or writing numerals. It is for this reason that the Hindu number \nsystem is now used throughout the world. \nThe use of 0 as a digit, and indeed as a number, was a breakthrough \nthat truly changed the world of mathematics and science. In Indian \nmathematics, indeed, zero was not just used as a placeholder in the place \nvalue system, but was also given the status of a number in its own right, \non par with other numbers. The arithmetic properties of the number 0 \n(e.g., that 0 plus any number is the same number, and that 0 times any \nnumber is zero) were explicitly used by Aryabhata in his Āryabhaṭīya in \n499 CE to compute with and do elaborate scientific computations using \nHindu numerals. The use of 0 as a number like any other number, on \nwhich one can perform the basic arithmetic operations, was codified \nby Brahmagupta in his work Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE, as we \nlearned in an earlier grade.  \nBy introducing 0 as a number, along with the negative numbers, \nBrahmagupta created what in modern terms is called a ring, i.e., a set of \nnumbers that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication \n(i.e., any two numbers in the set can be added, subtracted, or multiplied \nto get another number in that set).  These new ideas laid the foundations \nfor modern mathematics, and particularly for the areas of algebra and \nanalysis.  \nHopefully, this gives you a sense of all the ideas that went into writing \nand computing with numbers in the way that we do today.  The discovery \nof 0 and the resulting Indian number system is truly one of the greatest, \nmost creative, and most influential inventions of all time — appearing \nconstantly in our daily lives and forming the basis of much of modern \nscience, technology, computing, accounting, surveying, and more.

It is a \nplace value system with (usually) 10 digits, including the digit \n0 which is treated on par with other digits. Due to its use of 0 \nas a number, the system enables the writing of all numbers \nunambiguously using just finitely many symbols, and also \nenables efficient computation.

For the quadrilateral to be a \nrectangle, we need to answer the following questions —\n1. \u0007What is the length of the other diagonal?\n2. \u0007What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals?\n3. \u0007What should the angle be between the diagonals?\nLet us answer these questions using \ngeometric reasoning (deduction). If \nthat is challenging, try to construct/\nmeasure some rectangles.\nTo find the answers to these \nquestions, let us suppose that we \nhave placed the diagonals such that \ntheir endpoints form the vertices of \na rectangle, as shown in Fig. 2.\nA\nB\nD\nC\nO\nFig. 1\nA\nD\nB\nC\nFig. 2\nAC = 8 cm\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nDeduction 1 — What is the length of the other diagonal?\nThis can be deduced using congruence as follows —\nSince ABCD is a rectangle, we have \nAB = CD\n∠BAD = ∠CDA = 90°\nAD is common to both triangles.\nSo, ∆ADC ≅ ∆DAB by the SAS congruence \ncondition.\nTherefore, AC = BD, since they are corresponding parts of congruent \ntriangles. This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always have the \nsame length.\nSo the other diagonal must also be 8 cm long. You can verify this \nproperty by constructing/measuring some rectangles.\nDeduction 2 — What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals?\nThis can also be found using congruence.

So, O is the midpoint of AC and BD.\nThis shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always intersect at \ntheir midpoints.\nTherefore, to get a rectangle, the diagonals must be drawn so that \nthey are equal and intersect at their midpoints.\nWhen the diagonals cross at their midpoints, we say that the diagonals bisect \neach other. Bisecting a quantity means dividing it into two equal parts.\nVerify this property by constructing some rectangles and measuring \ntheir diagonals and the points of intersection.\nCan the following equalities be used to establish that ∆AOD ≅ ∆COB?\nAO = CO (proved above)\n∠AOB = ∠COD (vertically opposite angles)\nAD = CB \nDeduction 3 — What are the angles between the diagonals?\nLet us check what quadrilateral we get if we draw the \ntwo diagonals such that their lengths are equal, they \nbisect each other and have an arbitrary angle, say \n60°, between them as shown in the figure to the right.\nCan you find all the remaining angles?\t  \nMath \nTalk\n60°\nA\nB\nD\nC\nO\nWe can find the remaining angles between the \ndiagonals using our understanding of vertically \nopposite angles and linear pairs.\nO\n60°\n60°\n120°\n120°\nA\nB\nD\nC\nIn ∆AOB, since OA = OB, the angles opposite them \nare equal, say a.\nCan you find the value of a? \nO\na\na\nA\nB\nD\nC\n60°\n60°\n120°\n120°\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nIn ∆AOB, we have, \na + a + 60 = 180 (interior angles of a triangle).\nTherefore 2a = 120.\nThus a = 60.\nSimilarly, we can find the values of all the other angles.\nCan we now identify what type of quadrilateral ABCD is? \nNotice that its angles all add up to 90° (30° + 60°). \nWhat can we say about its sides?\nWe can see that ∆AOB ≅ ∆COD and ∆AOD ≅ ∆COB.

They should be equal and connected at their \nmidpoints.\nThis method is actually used in practice to \nmake rectangles. Carpenters in Europe use \nthis method to get a rectangular frame. It is \nalso known that farmers in Mozambique, \na country in Africa, use this method while \nconstructing houses to get the base of the \nhouse in a rectangular shape. \nThe Process of Finding Properties\nAs we have been seeing from lower grades, \nproperties of geometric objects such as parallel \nlines, angles, and triangles can be deduced through geometric reasoning. \nWe will continue to deduce properties of special types of quadrilaterals \nin this chapter. \nOnce you have deduced a property of a quadrilateral, it is good to verify \nit with a real-world quadrilateral, either the quadrilateral constructed \non paper or simply a surface having the shape of the quadrilateral. \nIf you are not able to figure out the property using deduction, you \ncould experiment by taking real-world quadrilaterals and observing the \nproperty  through measurement. Note that these observations give \nuseful insights about the property, but with them, we can only form a \nconjecture, that is, a statement about which we are highly confident, \nbut not yet sure if it always holds true. For example, constructing a \nfew rectangles and observing through measurement that their diagonals \nbisect each other does not necessarily mean that this will always be the \ncase — can we be sure that the 1000th rectangle we construct will also \nhave this property? The only way we can be sure of this property is by \njustifying or proving the statement, just as we did in Deduction 2.\nA\nB\nD\nC\nA\nB\nD\nC\nA\nC\nO\nO\nO\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\nNote to the Teacher: Gently encourage students to deduce or justify properties. \nWhenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and \nobserve, and use their intuition to figure out the properties.\nQuadrilaterals\nThe Carpenter’s Problem shows that rectangles can also be defined as \nfollows —\nRectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are equal \nand bisect each other.\nObserve how different this definition is from the earlier one. Yet, both \ncapture the same class of quadrilaterals. Further, it turns out that the \nfirst definition can be simplified.\nIn the earlier definition, we stated that a rectangle has (a) opposite sides \nof equal length, and (b) all angles equal to 90°. Would we be wrong if we \njust define a rectangle as a quadrilateral in which all the angles are 90°?\nIf you think that this definition is incomplete, try constructing a \nquadrilateral in which the angles are all 90° but the opposite sides are \nnot equal. \nAre you able to construct such a quadrilateral? \nLet us prove why this is impossible.\nDeduction 4 — What is the shape of a quadrilateral with all the \nangles equal to 90°?\nConsider a quadrilateral ABCD with all angles measuring 90°. What can \nwe say about the opposite sides of such a quadrilateral?\nJoin BD. ∆BAD and ∆DCB seem congruent. Can we justify this claim?\nTwo equalities can be directly \nseen in the triangles. What can we \nsay about ∠1 and ∠2?\nRecall that we tackled a very similar problem in Deduction 2. We can \nuse the same reasoning here.\nA\nB\nD\nC\nCommon side\nSince ∠B = 90°, \n∠3 + ∠1 = 90°.\nIn ∆BCD, since\n∠3 + ∠2 + 90° = 180°,\n∠3 + ∠2 = 90°.\n3\nA\nB\nD\nC\n3\nA\nB\nD\nC\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nSo, ∠1 = ∠2.\nThus, by the AAS congruence condition, ∆BAD ≅ ∆DCB. \nTherefore, AD = CB, and DC = BA, since these are corresponding sides \nof congruent triangles.\nIs it wrong to write ∆BAD ≅ ∆CDB? Why?\nThus, we have established that if all the angles of a quadrilateral are \nright angles, then the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, the \nquadrilateral is a rectangle. Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as \nfollows —\nRectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90°.\nLet us list the properties of a rectangle.\nProperty 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90°.\nProperty 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.\nAre the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel?\nThey definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the \ntransversal properties.\nNotice that AB acts as a transversal to AD \nand BC, and that ∠A + ∠B = 90° + 90° = 180°. \nWhen the sum of the internal angles on \nthe same side of the transversal is 180°, \nthe lines are parallel. We can use this fact \nto conclude that the lines AD and BC are \nparallel, which we represent as AD || BC. \nCan you similarly show that AB is \nparallel to DC (AB||DC)?\nProperty 3: The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel to each other. \nProperty 4: The diagonals of a rectangle are of equal length and they \nbisect each other.\nA Special Rectangle\nIn the quadrilaterals below, are there any non-rectangles?\nA\nB\nD\nC\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n5 cm\n5 cm\n2 cm\n6 cm\n3.6 cm\n5 cm\n5 cm\n1 cm\n2 cm\n6 cm\n3.6 cm\n1 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\n4 cm\nQuadrilaterals\nAll these quadrilaterals are rectangles, including (iv). Quadrilateral \n(iv) is a rectangle because all its angles are 90°. However, it is a special \nkind of rectangle with all sides of equal length. We know that this \nquadrilateral is also called a square.\nSquare: A square is a quadrilateral in which all the angles are equal \nto 90°, and all the sides are of equal length.\nThus, every square is also a rectangle, but clearly every rectangle is \nnot a square.\nI am an \nIndian \nand I am a \nMalayali.\nWait, which one of \nthem are you — an \nIndian or a Malayali? \nHow can you be both?\nThis relation can be pictorially represented using a Venn diagram. \nWe have seen these diagrams before. In a Venn diagram, a set of objects \nis represented as points inside a closed curve. Typically, these closed \ncurves are ovals or circles. \nFor example, the set of all squares is represented as\nEach point in the region represents a square, thereby covering all the \npossible squares. \nSince every square is a rectangle, the Venn diagram representation of \nthese two sets would be as follows —\nSquare\nRectangle\nSquare\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nLet us consider the Carpenter’s Problem again.

Let us label the square ABCD.\nTo find the angle formed by the diagonals, what are the two triangles \nwe should consider for congruence?\nBy the SSS condition for congruence, \n∆BOA ≅ ∆BOC\nCan this be used to find the angles ∠BOA and ∠BOC formed by the \ndiagonals?\nSince these angles are corresponding parts of congruent triangles, \nthey are equal. Further, these angles together form a straight angle. So \n∠BOA + ∠BOC = 180°. Thus, these angles have to be 90° each.\nA\nB\nD\nC\nO\nD\nA\nC\nB\nO\nCommon Side\nQuadrilaterals\nThis shows that the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right \nangles. This means that the diagonals have to be drawn such that they are \nof equal lengths and bisect each other at right angles. Since the endpoints \nof the diagonals uniquely determine the vertices of a quadrilateral, we \nwill get a square when the diagonals are joined this way.\nUsing this fact, construct a square with a diagonal of length 8 cm.\nProperties of a Square\nSince a square is a special type of rectangle, all the properties of a \nrectangle hold true for a square. \nVerify if this is true by going through geometric reasoning in Deduction \n1 and  Deduction 2, and see if they apply to a square as well.\nProperty 1: All the sides of a square are equal to each other. \nProperty 2: The opposite sides of a square are parallel to each other. \nProperty 3: The angles of a square are all 90°.\nProperty 4: \u0007The diagonals of a square are of equal length and they bisect \neach other at 90°.\nThere is one more special property of a square. \nWhat are the measures of ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, and ∠4?

What do you observe about \ntheir parities?\nRepeat this with other sets of 4 numbers.\nIs there a way to explain why this happens?\nHint: \u0007Think of the rules for parity of the sum or difference of two \nnumbers.\nExplanation 1: Let us consider any of the 8 expressions formed by four \nnumbers a, b, c, and d. When one of its signs is switched, its value always \nincreases or decreases by an even number! Let us see why.\nConsider one of the expressions: a + b – c – d. \nReplacing +b by – b, we get\na – b – c – d.\nBy how much has the number changed? It has changed by\n(a + b – c – d) –  (a – b – c – d)\n= a + b – c – d – a + b + c + d (notice how the signs changed when we \nopened the second set of brackets)\n= 2b (this is an even number).\nIf the difference between two numbers is even, can they have different \nparities? No! So either both are even or both are odd.\nNow, let us see what happens when a negative sign is switched to a \npositive sign.\nReplace any negative sign in the expression a + b – c – d with a positive \nsign and find the difference between the two numbers.\nWhat do you conclude from this observation?\nStarting from any expression, we can get 7 expressions by switching one \nor more ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs. Thus, all the expressions have the same parity!\nExplanation 2: We know that\nodd ± odd = even\neven ± even = even\nodd ± even = odd.\nWe have seen that the parity of a + b and a – b is the same, regardless \nof the parities of a and b.\nIn short, a ± b have the same parity. By the same argument, a ± b + c \nand a ± b – c have the same parity. Extending this further, we can say that \nall the expressions a ± b ± c ± d have the same parity.\nMath \nTalk\nNumber Play\nExplanation 3: This can also be explained \nusing the positive and negative token \nmodel you studied in the chapter on \nIntegers.

We can justify this in two different ways —\n•\t We know 4m is even and 2q is even for any integers m and q. \nTherefore, their sum will also be even.\n•\t The expression 4m + 2q is equal to the expression 2(2m + q). Here, \nthe expression 2(2m + q) means 2 times 2m + q. In other words, 2 is \na factor of this expression. Therefore, this expression will always \ngive an even number for any integers m and q.\nFor example, if m = 4 and q = – 9, the expression 4m + 2q becomes \n4 × 4 + 2 × (–9) = – 2, which is an even number.\nIn the expression x\n2 + 2, x\n2 is even if x is even, and x\n2 is odd if x is odd. \nTherefore, the expression x\n2 + 2 will not always give an even number. \nAn example and a non-example for when the expression evaluates to an \neven number — (i) if x = 6, then x\n2 + 2 = 38, and (ii) if x = 3, then x\n2 + 2\n  = 11.\nSimilarly, determine and explain which of the other expressions always \ngive even numbers.

Let \nus revisit them.\nDivisibility by 10, 5, and 2: If the units digit of a number is ‘0’, then \nit is divisible by 10. Let us understand why this works through algebra.\nWe can write the general form of a number in the Indian system \nusing a set of letter-numbers. For example, a 5-digit number can be \nexpressed as, edcba denoting e × 10000 + d × 1000 + c × 100 + b × 10 + a. The \nletter-numbers e, d, c, b, and a denote each digit of a 5-digit number.\nAny number can be written in general as … dcba, where the letter-\nnumbers a, b, c and d represent the units, tens, hundreds and thousands \ndigit, respectively, and so on. As a sum of place values, this number is —\n… +1000d + 100c + 10b + a.\n(For example, in the number 4075, d = 4, c = 0, b = 7, and a = 5.)\nWe know that each place value, with the exception of the units place, \nis a multiple of 10. So, 10b, 100c, … all will be multiples of 10. Hence, the \nnumber will be divisible by 10 if and only if the units digit a is 0.\nSimilarly, explain using algebra why the divisibility shortcuts for 5, 2, 4, \nand 8 work.\nLet us now examine shortcuts to check divisibility by some other \nnumbers and explain why they work!\nA Shortcut for Divisibility by 9\nCan you say, without actually calculating, which of these numbers are \ndivisible by 9: 999, 909, 900, 90, 990?\nAll of them.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nCan we say that any number made up of only the digits ‘0’ and ‘9’, in any \norder, will always be divisible by 9?\nYes, if each digit is either 0 or 9, then each term in its expanded form \nwill be 9 ×  or 0 ×  (the ‘   ’ denotes a place value). This means each \nterm will be a multiple of 9, for example, \n99009 = 9 × 10000 + 9 × 1000 + 0 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1.\nBut this shortcut alone cannot identify all the multiples \nof 9. Unlike the numbers 2, 5, and 10, we cannot identify \nthe multiples of 9 by just looking at the unit’s digit. 99 and \n109 are two numbers with 9 as the units digit; but 99 is \ndivisible by 9, while 109 is not.\nIs 10 divisible by 9? If not, what is the remainder?\nCheck the divisibility of other multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) by 9.\nYou will notice that for any multiple of 10, the remainder is the same \nas the number of tens.\nSimilarly, look at the remainder when the multiples of 100 (100, 200, \n300, … ) are divided by 9. What do you notice?\nThe remainder is the same as the number of hundreds for any multiple \nof 100.\nUsing this observation, find the remainder when 427 is divided by 9.\nWe see that 427 has 4 hundreds; thus, its corresponding remainder \n(upon division by 9) would be 4. 427 has 2 tens, and its corresponding \nremainder would be 2. We have 7 units also remaining. Adding all the \nremainders, we get 4 + 2 + 7 = 13. We can make one more group of 9 with \n13, leaving a remainder of 4. Therefore, 427 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 4.\n99\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n400\n7\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n4\n(Remainder)\nNumber Play\nWill this work with bigger numbers? \nYou can see that this is true for any place value:\n1 = 0 + 1\n10 = 9 + 1\n100 = 99 + 1\n1000 = 999 + 1\n10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when \nthe corresponding place value is divided by 9.\nFor example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can \njust add all the digits — 7 + 3 + 0 + 9 — to get 19. This can be seen as \nfollows:\n   7 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1\n= 7 × (999 + 1) + 3 × (99 + 1) + 0 × (9 + 1) + 9 × (0+1)\n= (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 × 1 + 3 × 1 + 0 × 1 + 9 × 1)\n= (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 + 3 + 0 + 9).\nThis means that the number 7309 is 19 more than some multiple of 9. \nThe digits 1 and 9 can further be added to get 1 + 9 = 10. Now, we can say \nthat 7309 is 10 more than a multiple of 9. And repeating this step for the \nnumber 10, we get the remainder to be 1 + 0 = 1, meaning 7309 is 1 more \nthan a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7309 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 1.\nA number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible \nby 9. Also, we can add the digits of a number repeatedly till a single \ndigit is obtained. This single digit is the remainder when the number is \ndivided by 9.\nLook at each of the following statements. Which are correct and why?\n(i)\t\nIf a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is \ndivisible by 9.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n7 × 1000\n3 × 100\n9 × 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n7 × 999\n3 × 99\n3\n999\n999\n999\n999\n99\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nThis is a \nmultiple of 9\nSo, we need to just  \nconsider this part\n(i.e., 7 + 3 + 9 = 19)\nThis is a multiple of 9\nSo, we need to just consider this part\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \n(ii)\t If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the \nnumber is divisible by 9.\n(iii)\t If a number is not divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is \nnot divisible by 9.\n(iv)\t If the sum of the digits of a number is not divisible by 9, then \nthe number is not divisible by 9.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Find, without dividing, whether the following numbers are divisible \nby 9.\n(i) 123    (ii) 405    (iii) 8888    (iv) 93547    (v) 358095\n2.\t Find the smallest multiple of 9 with no odd digits.\n3.\t Find the multiple of 9 that is closest to the number 6000.\n4.\t How many multiples of 9 are there between the numbers 4300 and \n4400?\nA Shortcut for Divisibility by 3\nWe know that all the multiples of 9 are also multiples of 3. That is, if a \nnumber is divisible by 9, it will also be divisible by 3. However, there are \nother multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 9 for example — 15, 33, \nand 87.\nThe shortcut to find the divisibility by 3 is similar to the method for 9. \nA number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Explore \nthe remainders when powers of 10 are divided by 3. Explain why this \nmethod works.\nA Shortcut for Divisibility by 11\nInterestingly, the shortcut for 11 is also based on checking the \nremainders with place value. Let us see how.\nLearning maths is not just about knowing some shortcuts and \nfollowing procedures but about understanding ‘why’ something \nworks.\nNumber Play\nUnits place \n(1)\n11 × 0 = 0\n1 = 11 × 0 + 1\n1 is one more \nthan a multiple \nof 11.\nTens place \n(10)\n11 × 1 = 11\n10 = 11×1 – 1\n10 is one less \nthan a multiple \nof 11.\nHundreds \nplace (100)\n11 × 9 = 99\n100 = 11×9 + 1\n100 is one more \nthan a multiple \nof 11.\n...\nThousands \nplace \n(1000)\n11 × 91 = 1001\n1000 = 11×91 \n– 1\n1000 is one less \nthan a multiple \nof 11.\n......\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThis alternating pattern of one more than 11 and one less than 11 \ncontinues for higher place values.\nSince 400 contains 4 hundreds, 400 is 4 more than a multiple of \n11 (396 + 4). Since 60 contains 6 tens, 60 is 6 less than a multiple of \n11 (66 – 6). Since 2 contains 2 units, 2 is 2 more than a multiple of 11, \ni.e., 2 = (0 + 2).\nUsing these observations, can you tell whether the number 462 is \ndivisible by 11? \nWhat could be a general method or shortcut to check divisibility by \n11?\nMath \nTalk\nMath \nTalk\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nWe saw that the place values alternate as 1 more and 1 less than a \nmultiple of 11.

Will checking the divisibility by \nits factors, 4 and 6, work? Why or why not? \nDetermining divisibility by 24 by checking divisibility by 4 and by 6 \ndoes not work. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 4 and 6, \nbut not by 24. \nTo check for the divisibility by 24, we can instead check for the \ndivisibility by 3 and divisibility by 8. \nExplain using prime factorisation why checking divisibility by 3 and \n8 works for checking divisibility by 24, but checking divisibility by 4 and \n6 is not sufficient for checking divisibility by 24.\nThere are such shortcuts to check divisibility by every number until \n100, and for some numbers beyond 100. You may try to understand how \nthese work after learning certain concepts in higher grades.\nDigital Roots\nTake a number. Add its digits repeatedly till you get a single-digit \nnumber. This single-digit number is called the digital root of the number. \nFor example, the digital root of the number 489710 will be \n2 (4 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 1 + 0 = 29, 2 + 9 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2).\nWhat property do you think this digital root will have?

Algebra \ncan also be used to justify or prove claims and conjectures (like the many \nproperties you saw in the previous chapter) and to solve problems of \nvarious kinds. \nDistributivity is a property relating multiplication and addition that \nis captured concisely using algebra. In this chapter, we explore different \ntypes of multiplication patterns and show how they can be described in \nthe language of algebra by making use of distributivity.\n6.1 Some Properties of Multiplication\nIncrements in Products\nConsider the multiplication of two numbers, say, 23 × 27.\n1. \u0007By how much does the product increase if the first number (23) is \nincreased by 1?\n2. \u0007What if the second number (27) is increased by 1?\n3. \u0007How about when both numbers are increased by 1?\nDo you see a pattern that could help generalise our observations to the \nproduct of any two numbers?\nLet us first consider a simpler problem — find the increase in the \nproduct when 27 is increased by 1. From the definition of multiplication \n(and the commutative property), it is clear that the product increases by \n23. This can be seen from the distributive property of multiplication as \nwell. If a, b and c are three numbers, then —\nWe Distribute, Yet Things Multiply\nThis is called the distributive property of multiplication over \naddition. Using the identity a (b + c) = ab + ac with a = 23, b = 27, and \nc = 1, we have\nRemember that here, a (b + c) and 23 (27 + 1) mean a × (b + c), and \n23 × (27 + 1), respectively. We usually skip writing the ‘×’ symbol before \nor after brackets, just as in the case of expressions like 5a, xy, etc.\nWe can also similarly expand (a + b) c using the distributive property \nas follows — \n\t\n\t\n\t\n(a + b) c = c (a + b) (commutativity of multiplication)\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n     = ca + cb (distributivity)\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n     = ac + bc (commutativity of multiplication)\nWe can use the distributive property to find, in general, how much a \nproduct increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased \nby 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and b. If one of the numbers, \nsay b, is increased by 1, then we have —\nNow let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are \nincreased by 1. If in a product  ab, both a and b are increased by 1, then \nwe obtain (a + 1) (b + 1).\na (b + c) = ab + ac \na (b + c)\n           . . . . .  \n           . . . . .  \n           . . . . . \n.   .   .            .    .\n.   .   .            .    .\n.   .   .            .    .\n.   .   .            .    .\n           . . . . .  \n           . . . . .\n            . . . . . .  \n            . . . . . .\n            . . . . . . \n    .   .                 .\n    .   .                 .\n    .   .                 .\n    .   .                 .\n            . . . . . . \n            . . . . . .\nab\nac\nb columns\nc columns\na rows\nThis property can be visualised nicely using a diagram:\nIncrease\n23 ( 27 + 1) = 23 × 27 + 23\nIncrease\na ( b + 1) = ab ×  a\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nHow do we expand this?\nLet us consider (a + 1) as a single term. Then, by the distributive \nproperty, we have\nThus, the product ab increases by a + b + 1 when each of a and b are \nincreased by 1.\nWhat would we get  if we had expanded (a + 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1) \nas a single term? Try it?\nWhat happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1 \nand the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product? \nLet us again take the product ab of two numbers a and b. If a is \nincreased by 1 and b is decreased by 1, then their product will be (a + 1) \n(b – 1). Expanding this, we get\nWill the product always increase? Find 3 examples where the product \ndecreases.\nWhat happens when a and b are negative integers? \nCheck by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above \ncases. For example, a = –5, b = 8; a = –4, b = –5; etc.\nWe have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that \nis, if x, y and z are any three integers, then x (y + z) = xy + xz. \nThus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the \nletter-numbers take on negative integer values as well.\nRecall that two algebraic expressions are equal if they take on the \nsame values when their letter-numbers are replaced by numbers.

Can you see \nhow this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased?\nFor example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased \nby 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b – 1) \nas (a + 1) (b + (–1). Taking m = 1 and n = –1 in Identity 1, we have \nab + (1) × b + a × (–1) + (1) × (–1) = ab + b – a – 1,\nwhich is the same expression that we obtain earlier. \nUse Identity 1 to find how the product changes when \n(i)\t one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3;\n(ii)\t both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4.  \nVerify the answers by finding the products without converting the \nsubtractions to additions.\nGeneralising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b – v) as follows.\n(a + u) (b – v) = (a + u) b – (a + u) v\n                        = ab + ub – (av + uv)\n                        = ab + ub – av – uv.\nCheck that this is the same as taking m = u and n = –v in Identity 1.\nAs in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b – v) is the sum of the product of \neach term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b – v (b and (–v)). Notice \nthat the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the \nusual rules of integer multiplication.\nExpand (i) (a – u) (b + v), (ii) (a – u) (b – v).\nWe get\n        (a – u) (b + v) = ab – ub + av – uv, and\n(a – u) (b – v) = ab – ub – av + uv.\nThe distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket.\nExample 1: Expand 3a\n2  (a – b + 1\n5).\n3a\n2  (a – b + 1\n5) = (3a\n2  × a) – (3a\n2  × b) + (3a\n2  × 1\n5 ).\nThe terms can be simplified as follows —\n3a\n2  × a = 3\n2 × (a × a).\nSee how the rules of integer multiplication allows us to handle \nmultiple cases using a single identity!\nWe Distribute, Yet Things Multiply\nUsing exponent notation, we can write 3\n2 × (a × a) = 3\n2 a2.\n3a\n2  × b = 3\n2 × (a × b) = 3\n2 ab.\n3a\n2  × 1\n5 = (3\n2 × 1\n5) a = 3\n10 a\nSo we get\n3a\n2  (a – b + 1\n5) = 3\n2a2 – 3\n2 ab + 3\n10 a.\nCan any two terms be added to get a single term?\nFor example, can 3\n2 a2 and 3\n10 a be added to get a single term?\nWe see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers, \nwhich would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So, \na further simplification of the expression is not possible. \nRecall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms.\nExample 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b). \nWe have (a + b) (a + b) = (a+b) a + (a + b)b = a × a + b × a + ab + b × b \n\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n   \t\n\t\n   = a2 + ba + ab + b2\nSince ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab \n(or, that are like terms), and so can be added —\nba + ab = ab + ab = 2ab\nSo we get\n(a + b) (a + b) = a2 + 2ab + b2.\nExample 3: Expand (a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2).\n(a + b) (a2 + 2ab + b2) = (a + b)a2 + (a + b) × 2ab + (a + b)b2\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n     = (a × a2) + ba2 + (a × 2ab) + (b × 2ab) + ab2 + (b × b2)\nThe terms can be simplified as follows —\na × a2 = a3 (why?)\nba2 = a2b\na × 2ab = 2 × a × a × b = 2a2b\n b × 2ab = 2 × a × b × b = 2ab2\nb × b2 = b3\nSo, (a + b)(a2 + 2ab + b2) = a3 + a2b + 2a2b + 2ab2 + ab2 + b3.\nWe see that a2b and 2a2b have the same letter-numbers (or, are like \nterms) and so can be added —\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \na2b + 2a2b = (1 + 2) a2 b = 3a2 b.\nSimilarly, ab2 and 2ab2 are like terms and so can be added —\nab2 + 2ab2 = (1 + 2)ab2 = 3ab2.\nThus, we have\n(a + b) × (a2 + 2ab +b2 ) = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3.\nA Pinch of History\nThe distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit \nin the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations, \nparticularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For \nexample, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Āryabhaṭa \n(in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner \nextensively in their mathematical and scientific works.  The first explicit \nstatement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his \nwork Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of \nthe property for multiplication as khaṇḍa-guṇanam (multiplication by \nparts). His verse states, “The multiplier is broken up into two or more \nparts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by \neach of these and the results added”. That is, if there are two parts, then \nusing letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c = ac + bc. In \nthe next verse (Verse 12.56), Brahmagupta further describes a method \nfor doing fast multiplication using this distributive property, which we \nexplore further in the next section.\nFigure it Out\n1.\t Observe the multiplication grid below.

The height is also half of A. Both the width and height \nhave changed by the same factor (through multiplication), 1\n2 in this \ncase. Since the widths and heights have changed by the same factor, the \nimages look similar.\nWhen we compare image A with image B, we notice that the width of \nB is 20 millimetre (mm) less than that of A. The height too is 20 mm less \nthan the height of A. Even though the difference (through subtraction) is \nthe same, the images look different. Have the width and height changed \nby the same factor? The height of B is half the height of A. But the width of \nB is not half the width of A. Since the width and height have not changed \nby the same factor, the images look different.\nCan you check by what factors the width and height of image D change \nas compared to image A? Are the factors the same?\nImages A, C, and D look similar because their widths and heights have \nchanged by the same factor. We say that the changes to their widths and \nheights are proportional.\nMath \nTalk\nProportional Reasoning-1\n7.2 Ratios\nWe use the notion of a ratio to represent such proportional relationships \nin mathematics.\nWe can say that the ratio of width to height of image A is\n60 : 40.\nThe numbers 60 and 40 are called the terms of the ratio.\u0007\nThe ratio of width to height of image C is 30 : 20, and that of image D \nis 90 : 60.\nIn a ratio of the form a : b, we can say that for every ‘a’ units of the \nfirst quantity, there are ‘b’ units of the second quantity.\nSo, in image A, we can say that for every 60 mm of width, there are 40 \nmm of height.\nWe can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D \nare proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same \nfactor. Let us see how.\nImage A — 60 : 40\nMultiplying both the terms by 1\n2, we get\n60 × 1\n2 : 40 × 1\n2 \nwhich is 30 : 20, the ratio of width to height in image C.\nBy what factor should we multiply the ratio 60 : 40 (image A) to get 90 : 60 \n(image D)?\nA more systematic way to compare whether the ratios are proportional \nis to reduce them to their simplest form and see if these simplest forms \nare the same.\n7.3 Ratios in their Simplest Form\nWe can reduce ratios to their simplest form by dividing the terms by \ntheir HCF.\nIn image A, the terms are 60 and 40. What is the HCF of 60 and 40? It \nis 20. Dividing the terms by 20, we get the ratio of image A to be 3 : 2 in \nits simplest form.\nThe ratio of image D is 90 : 60. Dividing both terms by 30 (HCF \nof 90 and 60), we get the simplest form to be 3 : 2. So the ratios of \nimages A and D are proportional as well.\nWhat is the simplest form of the ratios of images B and E?\nThe ratio of image B is 40 : 20; in its simplest form, it is 2 : 1.\nThe ratio of image E is 60 : 60; in its simplest form, it is 1 : 1.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nThese ratios are not the same as 3 : 2. So, we can say that the ratios of \nwidth to height of images B and E are not proportional to the ratios of \nimages A, C, and D.\nWhen two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the \nratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use \nthe ‘::’ symbol to indicate that they are proportional.\nSo a : b :: c : d indicates that the ratios a : b and c : d are proportional.\nThus, \n60 : 40 :: 30 : 20 and 60 : 40 :: 90 : 60.\n7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning\nExample 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72 : 96 proportional?\n3 : 4 is already in its simplest form.\nTo find the simplest form of 72 : 96, we need to divide both terms by \ntheir HCF.\nWhat is the HCF of 72 and 96?\nThe HCF of 72 and 96 is 24. Dividing both terms by 24, we get 3 : 4.\nSince both ratios in their simplest form are the same, they are proportional.\nExample 2: Kesang wanted to make lemonade for a celebration. She \nmade 6 glasses of lemonade in a vessel and added 10 spoons of sugar to \nthe drink. Her father expected more people to join the celebration. So he \nasked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade. \nTo make the lemonade with the same sweetness, how many spoons of \nsugar should she add? \nTo maintain the same sweetness, the ratio of \nthe number of glasses of lemonade to the number \nof spoons of sugar should be proportional. For 6 \nglasses of lemonade, she added 10 spoons of sugar. \nThe ratio of glasses of lemonade to spoons of \nsugar is 6 : 10. If she needs to make 18 more glasses \nof lemonade, how many spoons of sugar should \nshe use? We can model this problem as —\n6 : 10 :: 18 : ?\nWe know that each term in the ratio must change \nby the same factor, for the ratios to be proportional.\nHow can we find the factor of change in the ratio?\nThe first term has increased from 6 to 18. To find the factor of change, \nwe can divide 18 by 6 to get 3.\nProportional Reasoning-1\nThe second term should also change by the same factor. When 10 \nincreases by a factor of 3, it becomes 30. Thus,\n6 : 10 :: 18 : 30.\nSo, she should use 30 spoons of sugar to make 18 glasses of lemonade \nwith the same sweetness as earlier.\nExample 3: Nitin and Hari were constructing a compound wall around \ntheir house. Nitin was building the longer side, 60 ft in length, and Hari was \nbuilding the shorter side, 40 ft in length. Nitin used 3 bags of cement but \nHari used only 2 bags of cement. Nitin was worried that the wall Hari built \nwould not be as strong as the wall he built because she used less cement. \nIs Nitin correct in his thinking?\nIn Nitin and Hari’s case, we should compare the ratio of the length \nof the wall to the bags of cement used by each of them and see whether \nthey are proportional.\nThe ratio in Nitin’s case is 60 : 3, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form).\nThe ratio in Hari’s case is 40 : 2, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form).\nSince both ratios are proportional, the walls are equally strong. Nitin \nshould not worry!\nExample 4: In my school, there are 5 teachers and 170 students. The \nratio of teachers to students in my school is 5 : 170.

Engaging with these problems \nand finding solutions through a process of proportional reasoning should go along \nwith learning procedures and methods to solve the problems.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nExample 6: When Neelima was 3 years old, her mother’s age was 10 \ntimes her age. What is the ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age? \nWhat would be the ratio of their ages when Neelima is 12 years old? \nWould it remain the same?\nThe ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age when Neelima is 3 years \nold is 3 : 30 (her mother’s age is 10 times Neelima’s age). In the simplest \nform, it is 1 : 10.\nWhen Neelima is 12 years old (i.e., 9 years later), the ratio of their ages \nwill be 12 : 39 (9 years later, her mother would be 39 years old). In the \nsimplest form, it is 4 : 13.\nWhen we add (or subtract) the same number from the terms of a ratio, \nthe ratio changes and is not necessarily proportional to the original ratio.\nExample 7: Fill in the missing numbers for the following ratios that are \nproportional to 14 : 21.\n______ : 42      6 : ______       2 : ______\nIn the first ratio, we don’t know the first term. But the \nsecond term is 42. It is 2 times the second term of the \nratio 14 : 21. So, the first term should also be 2 times 14 \n(the first term). Hence the proportional ratio is 28 : 42.\nFor the second ratio, the first term is 6.\nWhat factor should we multiply 14 by to get 6? Can it \nbe an integer? Or should it be a fraction? \nWe can model this as 14y = 6. So, y = 6\n14 = 3\n7.\nSo, we need to multiply 21 (the second term of 14 : 21) also by the \nsame factor 3\n7. \n21 × 3\n7 is 9. So, the ratio is 6 : 9.\nIn the third ratio, the first term is 2. \nWe can see that when we divide 14 (the first term of 14 : 21) by 7 \n(HCF of 14 and 21) we get 2. \nIf we divide 21 also by 7, we get 3. So, the ratio is 2 : 3.\nFilter Coffee!\nFilter coffee is a beverage made by mixing coffee \ndecoction with milk. Manjunath usually mixes 15 \nmL of coffee decoction with 35 mL of milk to make \none cup of filter coffee in his coffee shop. \nIn this case, we can say that the ratio of coffee \ndecoction to milk is 15 : 35.\nIf \ncustomers \nwant \n‘stronger’ \nfilter \ncoffee, \nManjunath mixes 20 mL of decoction with 30 mL of \nmilk.

How many kilograms of rice should the cook make so that the \nfood is not wasted?\nThe ratio of the number of students to the amount of rice needs to be \nproportional. \nSo, 120 : 15 :: 80 : ?\nWhat is the factor of change in the first term?\nWe can find that by dividing the terms 80\n120 = 2\n3.\nThe number of students is reduced by a factor of 2\n3.\nOn multiplying the weight of rice by the same factor, we get, \n15 × 2\n3 = 10.\nSo, the cook should make 10 kg of rice on that day.\nThe situation above is a typical example of a problem where we need \nto use proportional reasoning to find a solution. Four quantities are \nMath \nTalk\nNote to the Teacher: In all these activities, encourage students to reason why their \ndrawings are proportional. \nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nlinked proportionally, out of which three are known and we must find \nthe fourth, unknown, quantity. \nTo solve such problems, we can model two proportional ratios using \nalgebraic notation as —\na : b :: c : d. \nFor these two ratios to be proportional, we know that term c should \nbe a multiple of term a by a factor, say f, and term d should be a multiple \nof term b by the same factor f. So,\nc = f a      ...(1)\nd = f b      ...(2)\nFrom (1) and (2), we can say that,\nf =  c\na  and f = d\nb .\nTherefore, c\na = d\nb.\nMultiplying both sides by ab, we get, \nab × c\na  = ab × d\nb \nab × c\na  = ab × d\nb \nbc = ad or ad = bc\nThus, when a : b :: c : d, then ad = bc. This is known as cross multiplication \nof terms. \nSince ad = bc, we can show that\nd = bc\na  .\nTwo ratios are proportional if their terms are equal when cross \nmultiplied. The fourth unknown quantity can be found through such \ncross multiplication. \n\t\nIn ancient India, Āryabhaṭa (199 CE) and others called such problems \nof proportionality Rule of Three problems. There were 3 numbers \ngiven — the pramāṇa (measure — ‘a’ in our case), the phala (fruit — ‘b’ \nin our case), and the ichchhā (requisition — ‘c’ in our case). To find the \nichchhāphala (yield — ‘d’ in our case), Āryabhaṭa says,\n“Multiply the phala by the ichchhā and divide the resulting product \nby the pramāṇa.”\nIn other words, Āryabhaṭa says,\n“pramāṇa : phala :: ichchhā : ichchhāphala,” therefore,\npramāṇa × ichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā.\nProportional Reasoning-1\nThus,\nichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā\npramāṇa\n.\nUsing the cross multiplication method proposed by Āryabhaṭa, ancient \nIndians solved complex problems that involved proportionality.\nExample 9: A car travels 90 km in 150 minutes. If it continues at the \nsame speed, what distance will it cover in 4 hours? \nIf it continues at the same speed, the ratio of the time taken should be \nproportional to the ratio of the distance covered. \n150 : 90 :: 4 : ?\nIs this the right way to formulate the question?\nNo, because 150 is in minutes, but 4 is in hours. The second ratio \nshould use the same units for time as the first ratio. Since 4 hours is 240 \nminutes, the right form is\n150 : 90 :: 240 : ?\nHow can you find the distance covered in 240 minutes?\nDiscuss with your classmates and find the answer using different \nstrategies.\nWe can model this proportion as\n150 : 90 :: 240 : x.\nBy cross multiplication, we get\n150 × x = 240 × 90\nTherefore,\t\n\t\n\t\nx = 240 × 90\n .\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n48    3\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n   = 240 × 90\n  = 144.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n   5\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n   1\nThe distance covered by the car in 4 hours is 144 km.\nExample 10: A small farmer in Himachal Pradesh sells each 200 g packet \nof tea for ₹200. A large estate in Meghalaya sells each 1 kg packet of \ntea for ₹800. Are the weight-to-price ratios in both places proportional? \nWhich tea is more expensive?\nNote to the Teacher: Instead of giving one ‘method’ to solve the problem of the \ndistance, encourage students to reason out the answer through different strategies. \nThey can use their understanding of equivalent fractions and equivalent ratios to \nfind the answer.\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nThe ratio of weight to price of the Himachal tea is 200 : 200.\nWhat is the weight to price ratio of the Meghalaya tea? Is it 1 : 800? \nThis would not be appropriate, because we considered the weight in \ngrams in the case of Himachal. So, the  weight to price ratio is 1000 : 800 \nin Meghalaya after we convert the weight to grams.\nTo check if the ratios are proportional, we need to see if both ratios \nare the same in their simplest forms.\nThe Himachal tea ratio in its simplest form is 1 : 1.\nThe Meghalaya tea ratio in its simplest form is 5 : 4. \nSo, the ratios are not proportional.\nWhich tea is more expensive? Why?\nTo answer the question as to which tea is more expensive, we should \ncompare the price of tea for the same weight in both places. \nWhat is the price of 1 kg of tea from Meghalaya? It is ₹800.\nIn Himachal, if 200 g of tea costs rupees 200, what is the cost of 1 kg \nof tea? \nLet us say that  the price of 1 kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is 1\n5 of 1 kg. \nSo,\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  \t\n5 × x = 200.\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get\n5 × x × 5 = 200 × 5\n5 × x × 5 = 1000\nx = 1000.\nSo, the cost of 1 kg of tea is ₹800 in Meghalaya and  ₹1,000 in Himachal \nPradesh. \nTherefore, the tea from Himachal Pradesh is more expensive. \nActivity 1: Take your favourite dish.

They should make tables with measure sizes and \nprices, and present them to the rest of the class. They should discuss if the prices are \nproportional or not, and why.\nProportional Reasoning-1\nThe ratio of the counters of your partner to yours is 5 : 7.\nNow, if you want to share the counters between the two of you in the \nratio of 3 : 1, how many counters would each of you get?   \nShare the counters in different ways and see which combination is in \nthe ratio 3 : 1.\nOne way to share the counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 is as follows —\n1.\t Your partner takes 3 counters and you take 1 counter. There are now \n8 counters left.\n2.\t Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. \nThere are now 4 counters left.\n3.\t Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. \nThere are no more counters left.\nSo, your partner gets 9 counters in total and you get 3 counters. \nWhen we divide 12 counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 between two people, \none gets 9 counters and the other gets 3 counters.\nNow, if you want to share 42 counters between the two of you in the \nratio of 4 : 3, how will you do it? \nUsing the same procedure would take a long time! There is a simpler \nway to share the whole with parts in a specified ratio.\nYou need to divide 42 into groups such that your partner gets 4 groups \nand you get 3 groups. \nWhat is the size of each group?\nIf your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups, the total number \nof groups is 7. So, the size of each group is 42 ÷ 7 = 6.\nMultiplying the number of groups by the size of each group, your \npartner gets 24 counters and you get 18 counters, when you share 42 \ncounters in the ratio of 4 : 3.\n3\n:\n:\n3\nSharing 12 \nin the ratio 3 : 1\nThe ‛whole’ is 12\nThe ‛whole’ is 4 (= 3 + 1)\nand 12 is 3 times 4\nThe ‛parts’ are \n3 times the ratio 3 : 1\n× 3\n× 3\nGanita Prakash | Grade 8 \nIn general, when we want to divide a quantity, say x, in the ratio m: n, \nwe do the following:\n1.\t We need to split x into groups such that it can be divided into two \nparts where the first part has m groups and the second part has \nn groups.\n2.\t But what is the size of each group? This can be found out by dividing \nx by the number of groups. The number of groups are m + n. So, the \nsize of each group is \nx\nm + n .\n3.\t So, the first part has m × \nx\nm + n objects and the second part has n × \nx\nm + n\nobjects.\nThus, if we want to divide a quantity x in the ratio of m: n, then the \nparts will be m × \nx\nm + n and n  × \nx\nm + n. We see that\nm  × \nx\nm + n : n  × \nx\nm + n :: m : n.\nExample 11: Prashanti and Bhuvan started a food cart business near \ntheir school.

They \ndecided that they would share the profit in the same ratio as that of their \ninvestment. What is each person’s share of the profit?\nThe ratio of their investment is 75000 : 25000.\nReducing this ratio to its simplest form, we get 3 : 1.\n3 + 1 is 4 and dividing the profit of 4000 by 4, we get 1000.\nSo, Prashanti’s share is 3 × 1000 and Bhuvan’s share is 1 × 1000.\n\u0007So, Prashanti would get ₹3,000 and Bhuvan would get ₹1,000 of the profit.\nExample 12: A mixture of 40 kg contains sand and cement in the ratio \nof 3 : 1.

It remains 30. But \nthe new ratio of sand to cement is 5 : 2. So the question is,\n5 : 2 :: 30 : ?\nIf the ratio is 5 : 2, then the second term is 2\n5 times the first term.

On the first page of each chapter, you will find a set of questions. \nThese are not meant for any exam— they are unique invitations to spark your \ncuriosity to explore the world of science!\nWhy is one side of a puri thinner than the other?\nAre there more grains of sand on all the beaches and deserts of the world, or more \nstars in our galaxy?\nRight from Grade 6, we’ve observed the incredible diversity of plants and animals \naround us. From the different shapes of leaves to the many kinds of insects — why \nhas nature created such a vast variety?\nIs there such a question that makes you curious about the \nworld? \nWrite it here! _________________________________  \nProbe and ponder\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nOur journey with Curiosity, into the world of science continues \nin Grade 8. We hope you bring along the spirit of adventure and \nexploration that has guided us so far. In Grade 6, we discovered \nhow science begins with wonder, with simple “Why?” and \n“How?” questions about the world around us.\nIn Grade 7, we learnt that science is always evolving — that \neach answer opens new questions, and how our ideas can slowly \nchange as we explore deeper. Now, in Grade 8, we take the next \nstep: entering the Investigative World of Science, where wonder \nand evolution come together to form the heart of how science \nworks.\nWe don’t want you to just learn new facts, we want you to \nlearn how to find new facts. Investigation in science means more \nthan just looking at something and asking only simple questions. \nNow you can ask more focused questions, and design ways to \nperhaps do simple experiments to answer those questions, and \nthen use your observations to improve your understanding.\nStep by step, we will learn how to use questions as starting \npoints to try to observe carefully, experiment thoughtfully, and \nexplain clearly what we see. In doing so, each of you won’t just \nbe learners but also investigators, young scientists, exploring \nreal-world puzzles. These may range from everyday life — like \nwhy does dough rise? — to the bigger mysteries of Earth and \nbeyond like is the world getting warmer?\nAs you turn each page of this book, we hope you notice the \ninteresting design of our page numbers once again. On the \nleft-hand pages, at the bottom, you’ll find the image of a root, \nsymbolising the deep, solid foundation of knowledge that keeps \nus connected to our environment, traditions, and our cultural \nand natural heritage.\nOn the right-hand pages, in the top corner, you’ll find a \nkite soaring in the sky, reminding us that curiosity must take \nflight if we are to explore the unknown. Together, these two \nsymbols — the root and the kite — invite you to stay grounded in \nreal observations, while allowing your ideas to soar towards new \nhorizons. Remember, investigation in science works best only \nwhen we balance the solid ground of careful observation with \nthe freedom of creative thinking.\nYou will also notice some patterns in the lines at the bottom \nof the page. There are some hidden scientific thoughts in these as \nwell. But don’t worry, they are mainly to make the page a little \nless boring. Let us now take a brief look at the various stops on \nour journey this year, and see where our curiosity, supported by \nstrong roots and lifted by soaring ideas, might take us!\nChapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science\nThis year, our investigative adventure will take \nus on a journey from the tiny microbes we can’t \nsee to planet-wide challenges we can’t ignore.\nWe will start by examining something as small \nas a single drop of water, and uncover a hidden \nworld of tiny organisms, unseen but deeply \nlinked to us. Some of these are invisible helpers, \nthat help us digest our food or produce medicines, \nwhile others can be harmful, causing infections.\nBut what does our body need to stay healthy? How do we fight \nthese infections? We’ll find out how nutritious food, exercise, \nmedicines, and vaccines help us stay healthy and fight infections. \nBut that’s just the beginning. In today’s world, science does play \na major role in improving our lives.\nFor example, we use electric current in many \nways to help make our lives easier. We depend \non the heating effect of electric current to keep \nus warm, while the magnetic effect helps motors \nrun and machines function.\nThese phenomena depend on fundamental forces. So after \nwatching electricity do work, we move on to study these forces \nthemselves, starting with those that make objects speed up, slow \ndown, or change direction.\nUnderstanding forces helps explain why a ball thrown up \nin the air falls back to the ground, or why a car stops when \nthe brakes are applied.\nThis also leads us to the idea of pressure — how the force \nis distributed over an object. The same concepts of force \nand pressure also decide how air moves. A small difference \nin pressure can result in a gentle breeze while a stronger \npressure difference can lead to strong winds, and sometimes \neven cyclones.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nSo, these forces are connected to powerful weather \nevents—like storms and cyclones—that affect our daily \nlives, agriculture, and even our safety.\nTo truly understand how air can exert pressure or \nwhy water boils at a certain temperature we need to \nzoom into these materials and see what kind of particles \nthey are made up of, and how they move around.\nEverything around us is made of tiny particles. \nIn materials that are solid these particles cannot move \nmuch, while in gases they can move around freely.\nClassifying things around us is an important feature \nof science. We can also classify materials around us \ninto elements (pure substances), compounds (two \nor more elements bonded together), and mixtures \n(combinations that can be separated physically).\nOnce we know how particles combine or mix, we can then \nunderstand solutions — for example, how sugar dissolves in tea \nto make it sweet.\nFrom the world of particles and \nmixtures, we then move into the world \nof light. We’ll study how light rays reflect \noff flat and curved mirrors, and bends \nwhen passing through lenses and helps \nus understand the working of many \nobjects around us. The bending of light \nexplains what happens when we see an image in a shiny \nmetal spoon or how corrective glasses help many of us \nsee clearly.\nIt’s not just a polished mirror that reflects light, \nrough surfaces reflect light as well, and so does the \nMoon. Depending on the relative positions of the Earth, \nMoon and Sun, a slightly different part of the Moon is \nilluminated each night, giving rise to the beautiful phases \nof the Moon that we see in the sky.\nWatching the periodic cycles of the Moon’s phases allowed \nhumans to come up with the first calendars. By combining careful \nobservations of sunrises, sunsets, and lunar cycles, various \ncalendars came into being. Isn’t it fascinating that the calendars \nwhich determine our routines on Earth are linked to the motions \nof objects  far beyond our planet?\nChapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science\nBut it’s not just calendars or the movements \nof the Sun and Moon that are linked. Right here \non Earth, there are marvellous and complex \npatterns \nof \nrelationships \nbetween \nliving \norganisms and their environments. Every living \nbeing — from tiniest insect to the largest whale, \nfrom blades of grasses to tall trees — depends \non and responds to the air, water, sunlight, \nand other organisms around them forming the \necosystems that support life on our planet.\nIn the final chapter of this book, we can put \nit all together and try to understand what makes \nEarth ‘just right’ for life and to recognise the urgent challenges \nthat our planet now faces.\nMost importantly, the Earth lies at the perfect distance from \nthe Sun, where water remains liquid, and it has an atmosphere \nthat provides the oxygen we breathe while shielding us from \nharmful ultraviolet rays. But human activities on the planet can \ncause small changes in the temperature of the Earth, disrupting \nclimate patterns, with dangerous consequences.\nChaitra\nMAR\nAPR\n25\n26\n28\n30\n31\n3\n5\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n17\n19\n2\n3\n6\n8\n11\n12\n14\n16\n17\n20\n22\n25\n26\n28\n30 20\n(March 22 - April 20, 2025)\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nSUN\nAt the heart of both the problem — and any possible \nsolution — is us. We are the ones influencing Earth’s climate. \nBut we are also the ones who can — and must — use science to \nunderstand these changes and guide our actions.\nThe same scientific principles that we have guided our \njourney through the middle stages — observing, measuring, \nexperimenting — will be key in helping us protect the delicate \nbalance on which life depends. The challenges ahead won’t \nalways be easy. We hope some of you will try to solve these \ndifficult problems with Curiosity as your guide.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nTo help you think like a scientist, let us go back to a question \nwe asked on the first page: Why is one side of a puri thinner \nthan the other? \nFirstly, remember that science \nis everywhere! You don’t need \na fancy laboratory to do simple \nexperiments. Even your kitchen \nat home is a wonderful place to \nobserve and ask questions. All \nyou need is to start with curiosity, \ncareful observation, and asking \nwhat happens if…? Have you \nnoticed how a puri or a batura \npuffs up when placed in hot oil? \nOr how a phulka  swells when \nput directly on the flame. Why \ndoes it puff up like a balloon? And why is one side thinner than \nthe other? These are questions a scientist might ask — and you \ncan too! Let’s see how we can investigate this simple everyday \nphenomenon like a scientist would. \nFirst, we will try to ask a scientific question. What are \nthe different things that may change the way a puri puffs \nup when fried? To answer this, we may want to do some \nsimple experiments. For that, we try and find out two main \nthings — what all can we change or control when we do the \nexperiment, and what all can we observe to see if these changes \nmade any difference.  \nIn this case, we can perhaps think of the changing the thickness \nand the size of the rolled dough. We could also try to use different \ntypes of flour (atta, maida, etc.). While frying the puri, we can also \nchange the temperature of the hot oil, or try and drop the rolled \ndough into the oil in different ways (drop it vertically? slide it at \nan angle? slide it slowly?) Notice that these are things that we \ncan control. \nHowever, to make sense of the changes, we also need to think \nof what we can observe or measure. Some of these may have \njust yes/no answers, in some cases there might be a number \nwe can measure. Maybe we can start by checking whether the \npuri puffs up (yes/no), or we can measure the time it takes to \npuff up (seconds). We can check whether a very thick layer of \ndough still gives a thin side to the puri. Further, while doing such \nexperiments, it is better to change only one thing at a time while \nkeeping the other conditions same. For example, if we wanted to \nsee the effect of boiling hot, hot, and not very hot oil, we would \nChapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science\nuse circles of dough of the same thickness, and drop them in the \nsame way. It is also a good idea to keep notes of everything that \nyou see and sense when doing an experiment. Did the oil splatter, \nsmell, or smoke? And after doing one round of experiments, you \nmay think of more questions. Do puris puff better when made \nfresh or from stored dough? What happens if I prick a hole in the \npuri before frying? \nThis is exactly how all scientific experiments, from simple \nto the most complicated are done. This is the idea of systematic \ninvestigation. And just so you know, even this simple everyday \nobservation — of a puri swelling — is not really completely \nunderstood by scientists today! \nSo, whether it is the swelling of a puri or the shrinking bright \npart of the Moon after purnima, let your careful observations \nguide you along your explorations into the investigate world \nof science. \nHappy investigating!", "source": "NCERT"}

The centre had many fascinating displays on nature, \nspace, and technology. While her parents explored a section on \nsaving water and electricity, Meena and her brother wandered off \nto look around. In one corner, Meena noticed a row of unusual, \ncurved mirrors. Curious, she stepped closer and looked into one. \nHer face appeared unusually large, while her brother, standing \na little farther away, looked upside down! At another mirror, she \nsaw a tiny version of herself. Meena was puzzled.\nShe remembered doing activities with a mirror earlier where \nthe image formed by the mirror was of the same size as the object \nand was erect (in the chapter ‘Light: Shadows and Reflections’ \nin Curiosity, Grade 7). Seeing her confusion, a guide from the \nscience centre walked up to her and smiled. “These are not plane \nmirrors,” the guide explained. “These are spherical mirrors. \nWhen the mirror is curved inward or outward, your image looks \ndifferent in them!” Meena’s curiosity grew and she decided to \ntalk to her teacher about these spherical mirrors.\n10.1 What Are Spherical Mirrors?\nActivity 10.1: Let us explore\n\t\nz Take a shiny metallic spoon and hold its \ncurved surface close to your face. Can you \nsee your image in it?\n\t\nz Notice the image of your face. Is it different \nfrom the image you see in a plane mirror? \n\t\nz While observing the image, slowly move the \nspoon away from your face. Do you observe \nany change in the image?\n\t\nz Now flip the spoon and repeat the same steps.\nDid you notice that the shiny metallic spoon acted \nlike a mirror and you could see your image in it? \nWhen you looked at the inner side of the spoon which is curved \ninwards, you must have observed that the image was inverted \n(Fig. 10.1a). When you looked at the outer side of the spoon which \nbulges outwards, the image of your face was erect but smaller in \nsize (Fig. 10.1b). \nCurved mirrors, like the spoon, can also be specially made. \nSpherical mirrors are a common type of curved mirrors which \nare shaped like a part of a hollow glass sphere. Mirrors, whose \nreflecting surfaces are spherical are called spherical mirrors. \n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10.1: Image formed in a shiny \nmetallic spoon from its (a) Inner curved \nsurface; (b) Outer curved surface\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nThe reflecting surface of the spherical mirror may be curved \ninwards or outwards. A spherical mirror, which has a reflecting \nsurface that curves inwards, is called a concave mirror \n(Fig. 10.2a). Its schematic representation is shown in Fig. 10.2b. \nThe outline of the surface of the mirror is circular.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10.2: (a) Concave mirror; \n(b) Its representation\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10.3: (a) Convex mirror; \n(b) Its representation\nA spherical mirror which has a reflecting surface that curves \noutwards is called a convex mirror (Fig. 10.3a). Its schematic \nrepresentation is shown in Fig. 10.3b.\nIn the representation of both the mirrors, the non-reflecting \nsurface of the mirror is shown as shaded.\nA step further\nThe shape of a spherical mirror is such that it can be thought of as \na part of an imaginary hollow sphere. However, remember that \nspherical mirrors are not made by slicing a hollow glass sphere. \nInstead, they are created by grinding and polishing a flat glass \npiece into a curved surface. If a reflective coating (like a thin layer \nof aluminium) is applied on the outer curved surface, it forms \na concave mirror. If the coating is applied on the inner curved \nsurface, it forms a convex mirror.\nImaginary \nhollow \nsphere\nA piece of \nimaginary \nhollow sphere\nConcave \nmirror\nConvex \nmirror\nCoated \nsurface\nReflecting \nsurface\nReflecting \nsurface\nChapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses\nActivity 10.2: Let us distinguish\n\t\nz Place concave and convex mirrors on a table \nwith their reflecting surfaces facing upwards. \n\t\nz Now view them from the side, keeping your \neye at their level, to identify whether the \nreflecting surface is curved inwards or \noutwards (Fig. 10.4).\nFig. 10.4: Identifying concave and convex mirrors from their side view \nConcave mirror\nConvex mirror\n10.2 What Are the Characteristics of Images \nFormed by Spherical Mirrors?\nActivity 10.3: Let us explore\n\t\nz Take a concave mirror, a convex \nmirror, two small wooden blocks \nor something similar to place the \nmirrors in an upright position, and \na small toy or some other object.\n\t\nz Place the two mirrors side by side \nin an upright position on a table. \nKeep the object in front of them at \na small distance (3–4 cm away) as \nshown in Fig. 10.5a. What kind of \nimages do you see in each mirror? \nAre the images of the same size as \nthe object? Are they erect? Do you \nsee lateral inversion in the images? \nWrite down your observations in your notebook.\n\t\nz Now slowly move the object away from the mirrors.

Again, note down your observations.\n\t\nz Repeat the steps with each mirror individually.\n\t\nz Analyse your observations and draw conclusions.\nHow can we distinguish \nbetween concave and \nconvex mirrors?\nFig. 10.5: An object placed in front of concave and \nconvex mirrors at (a) Small distance; (b) Large distance\n(a)\n(b)\nConcave \nmirror\nConvex \nmirror\nConvex \nmirror\nConcave \nmirror\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nIn the concave mirror, when the object is placed close to the \nmirror, the image is erect but larger than the object in size, that is, \nenlarged. However, when the object is moved farther away, the \nimage becomes inverted. Initially, the image is enlarged in size  and \nthen keeps getting smaller. In case of a convex mirror, the image \nis always erect and smaller than the object, that is diminished. \nHowever, the size of the image decreases slightly as the object is \nmoved away from the convex mirror. \nThis activity shows that spherical mirrors (concave and \nconvex) behave differently from plane mirrors. A plane mirror \nalways forms an erect image of the same size as the object. \nHowever, in the concave and convex mirrors, the size of the \nimage changes as the distance of the object from the mirror \nchanges. In addition, in the case of a concave mirror, the image \nalso gets inverted when the object is taken away from the mirror. \nLateral inversion of the image is seen in all three types of mirrors. \nI just got an idea. We can also identify \nwhether a mirror is plane, or concave, \nor convex by looking at the images of an \nobject formed in them!\nYes. But where do we \nfind concave and convex \nmirrors being used in \nour surroundings?\nThe reflectors of torches, headlights of cars \nand scooters are concave in shape (Fig. 10.6a).\nHave you ever noticed a dental mirror used by \na dentist for inspecting teeth? It is a concave \nmirror which provides an enlarged view of teeth \nwhen held close to the teeth inside the mouth \n(Fig. 10.6b). \nA step further\nDo you remember learning about the use of telescope in the chapter \n‘Beyond Earth’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? Most modern telescopes are \nreflecting telescope that use curved mirrors, with the main mirror \nbeing a large concave mirror. \nLook at the side-view mirrors on vehicles. These mirrors are \nconvex. They always form an erect image of the traffic behind and \nsmaller than the actual vehicles. Also, since the convex mirror is \nFig. 10.6: Use of concave mirror (a) As a \nreflector of a torch; (b) By a dentist\n(b)\n(a)\nChapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses\ncurved outside, it provides a much wider area of the road behind. \nFurther, such convex mirrors are installed at road intersections \nor sharp bends to provide drivers \nfrom both sides the visibility of the \nother side and prevent collisions. \nConvex mirrors are also installed \nin big stores to monitor a large \narea to deter thefts.\n10.3 What Are the Laws of Reflection?\nLet us now repeat an activity which we did earlier in grade 7, \nbut this time we will extend it further. Do you remember doing \nthe activity for observing the reflection of a beam of light from a \nplane mirror?\nActivity 10.4: Let us experiment\nWe have observed images formed by \nthree types of mirrors — plane, concave, \nand convex. But are there any laws \nwhich govern the image formation?\nFig. 10.8: A beam of light falling on a \nmirror (a) At one angle; \n(b) At another angle\n(a)\n(b)\n\t\nz Collect a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a \ncomb, a paper clip to hold the comb upright, a \nsheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper.\n\t\nz As you did earlier, make a thin slit by covering \nall openings of the comb using black paper, \nexcept for one in the middle.\n\t\nz Spread a sheet of white paper on a table. Place \nthe plane mirror upright on it.\n\t\nz Using the thin slit and torch, obtain a thin beam \nof light along the paper and adjust it to fall upon \nthe mirror as shown in Fig. 10.8a.\n\t\nz Now, move the slit and torch slightly so that the \nbeam of light falls at a different angle on the \nmirror (Fig. 10.8b). Does the reflected beam of \nlight also shift? \nFig. 10.7: Use of convex mirror as a (a) Side-view mirror; (b) Road safety mirror; (c) \nSurveillance mirror\n(b)\n(c)\n(a)\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n\t\nz Make the beam of light fall on the mirror at different angles \nand observe how the direction of the reflected beam changes.\nTo understand this better, let us draw this on a paper, step by \nstep. But before doing that, let us learn how to represent light. \nWe often represent light by straight lines with arrows, or rays. \nRays indicate the path along which light travels. Do you remember \nlearning earlier that the light travels along a straight line?\n\t\nz Draw a line showing the position of the plane mirror. \nAlso, draw lines with arrows (rays) indicating the beam of \nlight falling on the mirror and the reflected beam of light as \nshown in Fig. 10.9a.\nThe ray of light that falls on the mirror is called the incident \nray. The ray of light that comes back from the mirror is called the \nreflected ray.\n\t\nz Now remove the mirror. From the point where the incident \nray strikes the mirror, draw a line making an angle of 90° to the \nline representing the mirror. This line is known as the normal \nto the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, O (Fig. 10.9b).\nThe angle between the normal and the incident ray is called \nthe angle of incidence (i) (Fig. 10.9c). The angle between the \nnormal and the reflected ray is known as the angle of reflection \n(r) (Fig. 10.9c). \n\t\nz On your drawing, measure the angle of incidence and the \nangle of reflection and note it in Table 10.1. \n\t\nz Repeat the activity several times by changing the angle of \nincidence. \n\t\nz Finally, let the incident beam fall on the mirror along the \nnormal and observe the direction of the reflected beam. \nWhat would be the angle of incidence and angle of reflection \nin this case?

If done carefully, the experiment shows that the angle of \nincidence (i) is equal to the angle of reflection (r). This is a law \nof reflection.\nFig. 10.9: (a) Drawing \nincident and ref lected \nrays; (b) Drawing the \nnormal; (c) Angle of \nincidence and angle of \nreflection; \n(d) Measuring angles\n(a)\ni\nr\n(c)\nnormal\n(d)\n(b)\nO\nIncident\nray\ni\nr\nPlane mirror\nRef lected \nray\nChapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses\nActivity 10.5: Let us experiment\n\t\nz Use the same setup as in Activity 10.4, \nbut place a stiff sheet of chart paper flat \non a table such that part of it extends \nbeyond the edge of the table.\n\t\nz Shine a beam of light on the mirror \nplaced on the sheet and observe the \nreflected beam on the extended portion \n(Fig. 10.10a).\n\t\nz Now, bend the extended part of the sheet \nalong the edge of the table.

This shows that the reflected \nbeam lies in the same plane as that of the \nincident beam. Bending the sheet creates a \nnew plane, breaking this alignment.\nThe incident ray, the normal to the \nmirror at the point of incidence, and the \nreflected ray, all lie in the same plane. \nThis is another law of reflection.\nA step further\nIn the two cases, even though the directions of incident rays are \ndifferent, they fall at the same point on the mirror, and thus, the \ndirections of normal are the same. However, the direction of the \nreflected ray is such that the incident ray, the normal at the point of \nincidence, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane in both cases. \nMirror\nReflected ray\nNormal\nIncident ray\nReflected ray\nNormal\nIncident ray\nMirror\nFig. 10.10: (a) Reflected beam visible along the \nextended portion of paper; (b) Reflected beam not \nvisible along the bent portion of paper\n(a)\n(b)\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nThe laws of reflection are valid for all kinds of \nmirrors — plane and spherical. But if multiple \nparallel rays fall on the spherical mirrors, we \nobserve something interesting.\nAre laws of reflection \napplicable to spherical \nmirrors also?\nActivity 10.6: Let us explore\n\t\nz Collect a plane mirror, a concave mirror, a convex \nmirror, stand for mirrors, a torch, a comb, and a \npaper clip to hold the comb upright.\n\t\nz Use the same setup as Activity 10.4 again, but instead \nof a single slit, leave many openings of the comb \nuncovered to obtain multiple parallel beams of light \n(Fig. 10.11a).\n\t\nz Let the multiple parallel beams of light fall upon the \nplane mirror, concave mirror, and convex mirror, \none by one. Observe the reflected beams. Is your \nobservation similar to what is shown in Fig. 10.11 \n(b), (c), and (d)?\nWhen multiple parallel beams of light fall upon a plane \nmirror, the multiple reflected beams are also parallel \n(Fig. 10.11b). However, when multiple beams of light fall \nupon a concave mirror, the multiple reflected beams get \ncloser, that is, they converge (Fig. 10.11c). Whereas, in \nthe case of a convex mirror, the multiple reflected beams \nspread, that is, they diverge (Fig. 10.11d). \nIn the case of spherical mirrors, even though each \nray of light follows the laws of reflection, the curved \nsurface of spherical mirrors causes the parallel beam of \nrays to either converge (concave) or diverge (convex) on \nreflection depending on the shape of the mirror.\nA step further\nIf we draw what we observed in Activity 10.6, we get the \nfigures like those shown below.\nConcave mirror\nConvex mirror\nPlane mirror\nFig. 10.11: (a) Multiple slits; \nMultiple parallel beams of light \nfall upon — (b) Plane mirror; \n(c) Concave mirror; \n(d) Convex mirror\n(a)\n(b) \n(c)\n(d)\nPlane mirror\nConcave mirror\nConvex mirror\nChapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses\nSo, the concave mirror \nconverges a light beam \nwhile the convex mirror \ndiverges it.

Do not look towards the Sun or into the mirror reflecting \nthe Sun. Focus the reflected light only on a piece of paper, not \ntowards anyone’s face or eyes.\n\t\nz Take a concave mirror and a sheet of thin paper \nor newspaper. \n\t\nz Hold the concave mirror with its reflecting surface \nfacing the Sun. Direct the light of the Sun reflected \nby the mirror on the sheet of paper. \n\t\nz Adjust the distance of the paper until you get a \nsharp bright spot on it as shown in Fig. 10.12. \n\t\nz Hold the mirror and the sheet of paper steady \nfor a few minutes. Does the paper start to burn \nproducing smoke?\nThe bright spot is formed on the paper because light from the \nSun, after reflection from the mirror, gets concentrated on this \npoint. This produces sufficient heat at this point which can ignite \nthe paper.\nA step further\nDevices which concentrate sunlight into a small area, using mirrors \nand lenses, are called solar concentrators. The concentrated sunlight \nis used to heat a liquid to produce steam which can be used to \ngenerate electricity or for providing heat for various purposes, such \nas large scale cooking or for solar furnaces. Solar furnaces are even \nused for melting steel! Do you remember learning in an earlier \nchapter, about electric furnaces for melting steel?\nFig. 10.12: Converging sunlight on \npaper using a concave mirror\nConcave \nmirror\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nWe explored the images of an \nobject formed by curved mirrors. \nBut how do objects look when \nviewed through transparent \nmaterials with curved surfaces?\n10.4 What Is a Lens?\nImagine \nlooking \nthrough \na \nflat \ntransparent glass window pane — all \nobjects look the same size and shape. \nBut would those objects continue to \nlook the same if the surface of the \ntransparent material is curved?\nActivity 10.8: Let us explore\n\t\nz Collect a flat strip of glass or clear plastic, such as a flat scale, \nfew drops of oil, dropper, water, and a paper or book with \nsome text printed on it.\n\t\nz Spread a few drops of oil on the surface of glass or plastic \nstrip and rub it to leave a very thin coating. You can also use \nwax instead of oil.\n\t\nz Using a dropper or your finger, place a small drop of water \non the oiled/waxed spot. (The oil/wax helps the water form a \nnice round drop.) \n\t\nz Examine the water drop. What is the shape of its surface? Is \nit flat or curved inward or curved outward?\n\t\nz Place the paper underneath the glass/plastic strip such that \nthe text is directly under the water drop (see Fig. 10.13).\n\t\nz Now, look down through the water drop at the text below. Do \nyou find some change in the size of the letters just below the \nwater drop? Do they look enlarged or smaller?\nThe surface of the water drop is curved outside. The letters \nunder the water drop look different — they might appear larger \nthan the letters nearby! The curved surface of the water drop \nmade the size of the text look different. This curved drop of water \nis acting like a simple lens. Have you seen a magnifying glass as \nshown in Fig. 10.14? It is also a lens that helps in reading small \nprint by making the letters appear bigger.\nA lens is a piece of transparent material, \nusually made of glass or plastic, which has \ncurved surfaces. Like mirrors, lenses can also \nbe convex or concave. \nA lens which is thicker at the middle as \ncompared to the edges is called a convex lens \n(Fig. 10.15a).\nFig. 10.13: View of text \nbeneath the water drop\nFig. 10.15: (a) A convex lens; \n(b) Its representation\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 10.14: A magnifying glass\nChapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses\nA lens which is thicker at the edges as \ncompared to the middle is called a concave \nlens (Fig. 10.16b).\nUnlike mirrors, lenses allow light to pass \nthrough them, and we see things through a \nlens rather than in a lens.\nWhat changes can be seen in the \nobjects when viewed through lenses?\nActivity 10.9: Let us experiment\n\t\nz Collect a convex lens, a concave lens, a lens holder, and a \nsmall object.\n\t\nz Take the convex lens and place it upright using its holder. \n\t\nz Place the object behind the convex lens (it may also be placed \non something to bring it up to the level of the lens).\n\t\nz Look at the object through the lens from the other side of \nthe lens (Fig. 10.17a) and note your observations in your \nnotebook. \n\t\nz Now slowly move the object farther from the lens and keep \nobserving how the image changes. How does the distance of \nthe object from the convex lens affect how it looks?\n\t\nz Now repeat the steps using a concave lens.\n\t\nz Analyse your observations recorded in your notebook \nand compare the images seen through both lenses. \nWhat conclusions do you draw?\nWhen an object is placed behind a convex lens at a small \ndistance from it and seen through the lens, the object appears \nerect and enlarged in size. As the distance between the object \nand the convex lens increases, the object appears inverted. It is \ninitially enlarged in size and then diminishes in size. An object \nplaced behind a concave lens and seen through the lens, always \nappears erect and diminished in size.

As she looked \nup at the sky filled with colourful kites, she noticed the Moon \nshining during the daytime. She was surprised as she had always \nthought the Moon appeared only at night. Also, the Moon did \nnot appear like a full circle, but that didn’t surprise her as much. \nShe knew its shape changed every night. Still, it got her thinking. \nShe remembered learning that the Moon is spherical and shines \nby reflecting sunlight. Then why isn’t the whole Moon visible \nevery night? For a moment, she wondered if it was due to a \nlunar eclipse. But eclipses are rare and brief. So, what causes the \nMoon’s changing shape?\n11.1 \u0007How Does the Moon’s Appearance \nChange and Why?\nLet us carefully watch the Moon to understand how its \nappearance changes over a month. You may have done a similar \nactivity earlier, but let us now do it in more detail.

Was the Moon visible on all days? \nDid the Moon appear at the same position in the sky as on the \nprevious day? \n11.1.1 Phases of the Moon\nYou may have observed that the \nbright portion of the Moon decreases \nfrom a full circle to a half circle \nin about a week, as shown in \nFig. 11.2. The bright portion continues \nto shrink for another week until it \nis no longer visible. This two-week \nperiod is called the waning period of \nthe Moon. Different names are given \nto the Moon’s visible shapes during \nthis cycle (Fig. 11.2). The day when \nthe Moon appears as a full bright \ncircle is called the full Moon day (or \nPurnima), and the day when it is not \nvisible is called the new Moon day \n(or Amavasya).\nAfter the new Moon, its bright side \ngrows to a half circle in about a week \nand to a full circle (full Moon) in another \nweek. The period when the bright part \nof the Moon increases is called the \nFig. 11.2: Waxing (Shukla Paksha) and waning period \n(Krishna Paksha) of the Moon as viewed from the Earth\nWaxing\nGibbous\nCrescent\nCrescent\nWaning\nFull Moon\nAbout 1 week\nAbout 1 week\nAbout 1 week\nAbout 1 week\nNew Moon\nGibbous\nChapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies\nwaxing period. In India, the waning period of the Moon is generally \ncalled the Krishna Paksha, while the waxing period is called the \nShukla Paksha. The Moon goes through a waning period followed by \na waxing period in a cyclical manner as shown in Fig. 11.2. The cycle \nfrom one full Moon to the next takes about a month.\nThe changing shapes of the bright portion of the Moon from \none day to another as seen from the Earth are called the phases \nof the Moon.\n11.1.2 Locating the Moon\nWhen you checked the Moon at the same time on successive \ndays (for example, at sunrise), did you see it in a different part \nof the sky? On a full Moon day, the Moon is nearly opposite the \nSun — when the Sun rises in the East, the Moon is almost setting \nin the West. On subsequent mornings at sunrise, as its bright \npart continues to decrease, the Moon appears to move closer in \nthe sky to the Sun. When the bright part of the Moon decreases \nto a half circle shape, the Moon is overhead at Sunrise. A few \ndays later, the crescent Moon appears even closer to the Sun. \nKnowing the phase of the Moon and whether it is waxing or \nwaning can thus help us find out where and when to look for \nthe Moon on any given day. A waxing Moon is easiest to spot at \nsunset, and a waning Moon at sunrise. Because of these shifts, \nthe Moon always rises and sets at different times than the Sun.\nA step further\nMany people believe the Moon rises when the Sun sets, but that \nis not always true. Look in a local newspaper or on the Positional \nAstronomy Centre (India Meteorological Department) website to find \nthe moonrise time in your area. Check these times for several days \nin a row and you will see that the Moon rises about 50 minutes later \neach day. Sometimes moonrise happens in the afternoon (around \n2:00 – 4:00 p.m.), so you can spot the Moon in the eastern sky during \ndaylight. You may need to wait about 30 minutes past the listed \nmoonrise time for the Moon to climb high enough for it to be seen.\nThe time and position of moonrise changes from one day to the next.\n7 April 2025\n14:23\n8 April 2025\n15:17\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n11.1.3 Making sense of our observations\nThe shape of the Moon itself does not change, only what \nwe see changes. You may recall learning earlier that the \nMoon does not emit light of its own, but shines because it \nreflects sunlight that falls on it. The half of the Moon that \nfaces the Sun receives sunlight and becomes illuminated \n(Fig. 11.3). The other half facing away from the Sun does \nnot receive sunlight and remains non-illuminated.\nThe Moon revolves around the Earth and, only one \nhalf of the Moon always faces the Earth. However, the \nportion of the Moon facing the Earth is not always its \nilluminated part. We can only see the illuminated portion \nof the Moon from Earth. Sometimes, the entire illuminated portion \nof the Moon faces the Earth, and at other times only a part of it. \nAt such times the illuminated portion of the Moon that we see is \nnot a full circle. On New Moon day, we do not see the illuminated \nportion of the Moon at all, as only the non-illuminated portion of \nthe Moon faces the Earth. Therefore, the Moon appears different \non different days.\nLet us do an activity to understand how the \nilluminated portion of the Moon, as seen by us, \nchanges when its position changes with respect \nto the Sun.\nActivity 11.2: Let us explore\n\t\nz Take a small soft ball and insert a stick into it (Fig. 11.4a). \nThis represents the Moon.\n\t\nz Go to a dark open place (at night), and ask a teacher or \nguardian to shine a torchlight towards you from about \n3 m to represent light coming from the Sun or stand near an \nelectric lamp. Your head represents the Earth.\n\t\nz Now hold the ball at arm’s length in one hand such that it is \nslightly above your head as shown in Fig. 11.4b. Keep the ball at \nposition E towards the direction of the lamp. Does the portion \nof the ball facing you appear to be illuminated or not?\n\t\nz Turn around slowly, in the anti-clockwise direction, with your \narm outstretched as shown in Fig. 11.4b and keep looking at \nthe ball. Does the shape of the illuminated portion change? \nIs the line separating the illuminated and non-illuminated \nportions of the ball curved?\n\t\nz Was your observation similar to the changing shape of the \nilluminated portion of ball shown in Fig. 11.4c? The shape of \nthe illuminated portion of the ball, as seen by you, changes \ndepending on where the ball is with respect to the lamp. \nFig. 11.3: Sunlight falling on \nthe Moon\nSunrays\nIlluminated\nNon-\nilluminated\nWhy does the illuminated \nportion of the Moon seen \nfrom the Earth decrease \nwhen it appears closer \nto the Sun?\nFig. 11.4: (a) Ball with stick\nChapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies\nA\nA\nB\nB\nC\nC\nD\nD\nE\nE\nF\nF\nG\nG\nH\nH\nA\n(c)\n(b)\nFig. 11.4: (b) A student using a ball and stick to understand phases of \nMoon; (c) The ball as seen by the student at different positions\nWhen the ball is held opposite to the direction of the lamp \n(at A), you are facing the entire illuminated portion of the ball, \njust like the full Moon day. On the other hand, when the ball \nis held towards the direction of the lamp (at E), you are facing \nthe non-illuminated portion of the ball, and cannot see the \nilluminated portion of the ball at all. This is similar to the new \nMoon day. Notice how in other cases, the line separating the \nilluminated and non-illuminated portions of the ball appears \ncurved (Fig. 11.4c), similar to the shape of the illuminated portion \nof the Moon viewed from the Earth on other days.\nUsing our observations of Activity 11.2, let us now try to \nunderstand the phases of Moon. Fig. 11.5a shows the positions of \nthe Moon corresponding to the different positions of the ball in \nFig. 11.4b. Also shown are the Earth and the sunrays. As shown \nin Fig. 11.5a, the Moon revolves once around the Earth from \nposition A to H and back to position A in about one month. The \nside of the Moon that faces the Sun is illuminated.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nThe portion of the Moon that faces the Earth is marked by the \norange dashed lines and arrows. The illuminated portion of only \nthis part of the Moon can be seen from the Earth. At positions \nB and H, more than half of the illuminated portion, called the \ngibbous phase, can be seen. At positions D and F, less than half \nof the illuminated portion, called the crescent phase, can be \nseen. The change in the fraction of the illuminated portion of the \nMoon seen from Earth causes phases of the Moon. \nThe phases that will be seen from the Earth at different \npositions of the Moon are shown in Fig. 11.5b. From A to C to E, \nwe see the waning phase, and from E to G and back to A, we \nsee the waxing phase. Since the rotation period of the Earth of \none day is much smaller compared to the revolution period of \nthe Moon which is nearly a month, on a given day, people on \ndifferent parts of the Earth see nearly the same phase.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 11.5a, on the New Moon day, the Moon \nappears closest to the Sun and it appears farthest on the Full \nMoon day. Is this not what we also observed in Activity 11.1?\nFig. 11.5: (a) The Moon at different positions in its orbit around the Earth; (b) The corresponding \nphases of the Moon as seen from the Earth.

It is an incorrect \nexplanation for the Moon’s phases that Earth’s shadow falls on it. As we \nhave learnt, the phases of the Moon occur due to the relative change in \norientation of the Sun, Moon, and Earth as the Moon revolves around \nthe Earth. The Earth’s shadow on the Moon causes a lunar eclipse, not \nthe Moon’s phases as we learnt earlier (in chapter ‘Earth, Moon and the \nSun’ in the Curiosity, Grade 7). \nLunar eclipses can only happen on a full Moon day and solar eclipses \ncan happen only on a new Moon day. But they do not occur every month \nbecause of the small tilt of the Moon’s orbit with respect to the Earth’s \norbit around the Sun.\nPosition \nfavourable for \neclipses \nEarth’s orbit \naround Sun \nMoon’s slightly \ntilted orbit \naround Earth \nLunar eclipse at \nthis position \nNo eclipses \non these full \nand new \nMoon days \nSolar eclipse \nat these \npositions \nSun\nLunar eclipse at \nthis position \nPosition \nfavourable for \neclipses \nNo eclipses \non these full \nand new \nMoon days \nMoon’s orbit around \nthe Earth\n(b) In the same time of \none day, the Moon would \nrevolve a bit further in its \norbit around the Earth. \n(c) So I will find the \nMoon overhead about 50 \nminutes later than today, \nwhen the Earth has \nrotated some more. \n(a) Today the Moon is \noverhead. The Earth \nwill rotate once in one \nday, and I will be back \nat this same position. \nFig. 11.6: The Moon takes about 50 minutes longer to \ncome back to nearly the same position in the sky.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n11.2 \u0007How Did Calendars Come into Existence?\nWe have learnt earlier that when viewed from the Earth, the Sun \nappears to rise in the eastward direction, set in the westward \ndirection every day, and rise again the next day. This apparent \nperiodic motion of the Sun seen by us is primarily due to the \nrotation of the Earth around its own axis. This natural cycle of \nthe Sun due to the rotation of the Earth, is the foundation of the \nday, a unit to measure time.\nThe average time that the Sun takes to go from its highest \nposition in the sky on one day to the highest position in the \nsky the next day, is 24 hours, and is called the mean solar \nday. The highest position of the Sun in the sky can be found by \nmeasuring the length of the shadows cast by an object during \nthe day. The shadow is shortest when the Sun is at the highest \npoint in the sky. \nActivity 11.3: Let us measure a day!\n\t\nz Find a small flat area in a ground which receives sunlight \nduring the day. Fix a 1 m stick vertically in it as shown in \nFig. 11.7. \n\t\nz Start observing at 11:00 a.m. Every \nminute, mark a dot on the ground \nat the tip of the stick’s shadow. Keep \nmarking dots until around 1:10 p.m.\n\t\nz Identify when the shadow was \nshortest and find out its time by \ncounting the number of dots. Record \nthis time in Table 11.2. Repeat this \nexercise for the next few days.\n\t\nz Find the duration of the solar day \nby finding a difference in time on \ntwo consecutive days as shown in \nTable 11.1.\nSo, changing phases of the \nMoon is a natural periodic \nevent, with a cycle of almost \na month, which can also be \nused for time keeping.\nYes, along with the natural periodic \nevents of day and night and the \nchanging seasons about which we \nlearnt earlier. But how are these \nperiodic events used for keeping time?\nFig. 11.7: Observing the length of the shadow \nat different times during the day. \nChapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies\nDate\nTime of shortest shadow \n(hh:mm)\nDuration of day (hh:mm)\n22 March 2025\n12:20\n——\n23 March 2025\n12:20\n24:00\n24 March 2025\n12:19\n23:59\nTable 11.2: Finding the duration of a solar day\nFind the average duration of the day. Is it nearly equal to \n24 hours? \nThe phases of the Moon give us \nanother natural cycle with a duration \nthat is longer than a day. The Moon \ntakes about 29.5 days (nearly a month) \nto cycle through all its phases. The \ncycle of the phases of the Moon is the \nbasis for a month, another unit to \nmeasure time (Fig. 11.8).\nThe next larger unit to measure \ntime is related to the natural cycle of \nseasons. Do you remember learning \nearlier \nthat \nthe \nEarth \nrevolves \naround the Sun and takes nearly 365 \nand a quarter days to complete one \nrevolution around the Sun? The Earth \nundergoes one cycle of seasons during \nthis time, which can be used to define \na solar year (Fig. 11.8).\n11.2.1 Lunar calendars\nIn ancient times, people had noticed that during one cycle of \nseasons, one can fit nearly 12 cycles of the phases of the moon, \nthat is, 12 lunar months. This is how lunar calendars came \ninto being, with the day as the shortest unit, a month of nearly \n29.5 days, and a lunar year consisting of 12 lunar months. The \nphases of the Moon thus gave an easy and a perfectly sound way \nto track the passage of time.\nHowever, in a lunar calendar the seasons do not remain \nsynchronised to the same lunar months in successive lunar years. \nThe reason is that the seasons repeat in approximately 365 days \nwhile the lunar year is 354 days long.\nFig. 11.8: The Earth goes around the Sun, and \nthe Moon revolves around the Earth in regular \nintervals of time.\nCycle of Earth’s seasons \ndue to its revolution \naround the Sun define \na year \nCycle of Moon’s phases \ndue to its revolution \naround the Earth \ndefines a month \nCycle of Sun returning \nto its highest position \nin the sky due to Earth’s \nrotation defines a day\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n11.2.2 Solar calendars\nIt was important to know the arrival of seasons for agricultural \npurposes. This need for a year to synchronise with seasons led to \nthe creation of solar calendars. The Gregorian calendar, widely \nused today, is a solar calendar. The months in solar calendars are \nadjusted to add up to 365 days. That is why in Gregorian calendars, \nsome months have 30 days, others 31, and February has only \n28 days.\nOn top of the 365 days, the Earth takes nearly an extra quarter \nof a day to complete one revolution around the Sun. These extra \nhours add up to approximately one day every four years. To \nadjust for this, solar calendars add an extra day every four years \nusing the concept of a leap year. In the Gregorian calendar, if a \nyear is divisible by four, then an extra leap day is added. So in a \nleap year, February has 29 days, which keeps the calendar well \nsynchronised with the seasons.\nA step further\nThe Earth takes slightly less time than 365 and a quarter day to \ngo from one spring equinox to the next spring equinox. Adding a \nday every four years helps to synchronise with the seasons, but \nit actually adds a little too much over time. To fix this, leap years \nare skipped every 100 years—like in 1700, 1800, and 1900. But \nskipping all of them would make the calendar lag slightly behind. \nSo every 400 years, a leap year is again added back—like in 1600 \nand 2000. These careful corrections keep the calendar closely \nmatched with the seasons over long periods of time!\nA step further\nAs we learnt earlier, seasons are caused by the Earth’s revolution \naround the Sun and its movement from the spring equinox to \nwinter equinox and back. The time between successive spring \nequinoxes is called the tropical year. Gregorian calendar is based \nupon tropical year.\nWe have also learnt earlier that the stars that rise at sunset \nchange throughout the year due to the Earth’s revolution around \nthe Sun. The time duration required for the same stars to rise \nagain at sunset is called the sidereal year, and it can also be used to \ndefine a solar calendar. The sidereal year is longer than the tropical \nyear by a mere 20 minutes, and so it takes a long time before \nthe differences between the two calendars become noticeable. \nIn modern times, astronomers use the sidereal year to keep track of \nthe Earth’s position in its orbit around the Sun.\nChapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies\n11.2.3 Luni-solar calendars\nThere is another kind of calendar which primarily uses the Moon’s \nphases for counting days and months but also make adjustments \nto stay in sync with the cycle of seasons.\nThe 12 lunar months add up to 354 days and thus fall short by \nnearly 11 days compared to the solar year. Thus every 2–3 years, \nOur scientific heritage\nFor thousands of years, people — including those in India — have been \nobserving the sky and developing calendars. People in ancient times did not \nknow that Earth revolves around the Sun, and lacked modern instruments. \nYet through years of careful sky observations, they noticed patterns and cycles \nin natural events. Hence, they could \ndetermine that the length of the year \nwas approximately 365 days allowing \nthem to create calendars. \nFor example, careful observation \nreveals that the Sun does not always \nrise exactly in the East. In summer, \nit rises a little northward of East \nand in winter a little southward of \nEast. These extremes happen on \nthe solstices, around June 21 and \nDecember 21 each year. The Sun’s \napparent northward movement from December to June is called Uttarayan, \nand its apparent southward movement from June to December is Dakshinayan. \nThis cycle repeats every year and is closely linked to the changing seasons. The \nTaittirīya Saṁhitā records it in the verse 6.5.3:\nतस्‍‍माादाादि�त्‍‍य: षण्माासाा दक्षिि±णेनैति� षडुत्तरेण ।\n“Thus the Sun moves southwards for six months and northwards for six \nmonths.” \nIn the past, the equinoxes and solstices were also tracked by identifying the \nstars that rose at sunset. Ancient Indian texts like the Surya Siddhanta noted \nthat the pattern of stars, Capricorn (called Makar in India), would be in the \nbackground of the Sun around the winter solstice during those ancient times.\nभाानोोर्मकरसंंस्‍ङ््क्राान्तेःः3 षण्माासाा उत्तराायणम्् ।\nकर्क्‍का��ा�देस्तुु तथैव स्याात् षण्माासाा दक्षिि±णाायनम्् ।।9।। \nTranslation: From the moment of the Sun’s entrance into the constellation \nof Capricorn, six months make up its northward progress (Uttarayana), so \nlikewise from the moment of entrance into the constellation of Cancer, six \nmonths are its southward progress (Dakshinayana). \nOver the years, different types of calendars have evolved based on specific \nneeds. A number of these calendars are used in different parts of India to track \ntime and celebrating festivals.\nPath of Sun on \nJune solstice \nUttarayan from December to June\nSouth\nNorth\nEast\nWest\nSun rises exactly in the \nEast and sets exactly in \nthe west on equinoxes \nPath of Sun \non December \nsolstice \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nthe accumulated difference becomes close to a full month. \nTherefore, every few years, an extra month (called Adhika Maasa \nor intercalary month) is added to the year in some calendars. This \nkeeps the solar year and the lunar cycle in step. Such calendars \nare called luni-solar calendars. They combine elements from \nboth the solar and the lunar calendars and are used in many \nparts of India.\nEver heard of ...\nYou may have heard of the names (or similar sounding names) \nof the months in various Indian luni-solar calendars — Chaitra, \nVaisakha, Jyeshtha, Ashadha, Shravana, Bhadrapada, Ashwin, Kartika, \nMargashirsha (or Agrahayan), Pausha, Magha, and Phalguna. In some \ncommunities, the new month starts on the first day after the new \nMoon and ends on the day of the new Moon. Such calendars are \ncalled Amant. In others, the start of the new month corresponds to \nthe day after the full Moon, and the month ends on the full Moon. \nSuch calendars are called Purnimant.\n11.2.4 The Indian National Calendar\nA national calendar by the Government of India is used along \nwith Gregorian calendar for multiple official purposes. \nShaka Era 1947\nChaitra\nMAR\nAPR\n25\n26\n28\n30\n31\n3\n5\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n17\n19\n2\n3\n6\n8\n11\n12\n14\n16\n17\n20\n22\n25\n26\n28\n30 20\n(March 22 - April 20, 2025)\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nSUN\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nSUN\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nSUN\nAPR\nMAY\n21\n24\n26\n29\n30\n2\n4\n5\n8\n10\n13\n14\n16\n2\n3\n5\n7\n8\n11\n13\n16\n17\n19\n21\n22\n20\n21\n29\n25\n27\n28 18\nVaisakha\n(April 21 - May 21, 2025)\nJyestha \n(May 22 - June 21, 2025)\nMAY\nJUN\n27\n28\n30\n1\n2\n5\n7\n10\n11\n13\n15\n16\n19\n21\n4\n5\n8\n22\n1\n10\n13\n14\n16\n18\n19\n22\n24\n27\n28\n30\nFig. 11.9: Indian National Calendar \nIt is a solar calendar (Fig. 11.9) consisting of 365 days in a year. \nThe year begins on 22 March, which is the day after the spring \nequinox. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, months in the Indian \nNational Calendar have either 30 or 31 days. The names of these \nmonths were taken from traditional Indian calendars. In a regular \nyear, the second to sixth months have 31 days and the rest have \n30 days. The leap years are matched to the Gregorian calendar by \nadding a day to Chaitra, the first month of the year. In such years, \nthe new year begins on 21 March of the Gregorian calendar.\nChapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies\nEver heard of ...\nIn 1952, the Government of India set up a Calendar Reform \nCommittee (CRC) to examine all existing calendars which were \nbeing followed in the country at that time and to recommend an \naccurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India. The CRC \nrecommended ‘Unified National Calendar’ was adopted for use \nwith effect from 21 March 1956 CE, that is, 1 Chaitra 1878 Saka. \nThe Indian National Calendar follows the general principles as that \nof the Surya Siddhanta.\nBe a scientist\nMeghnad Saha (1893 –1956)\nMeghnad Saha was a pioneering astrophysicist of \nIndia who studied stars and their temperatures and \ndeveloped a mathematical equation, famously known \nas the Saha equation. The Saha Institute of Nuclear \nPhysics, in Kolkata, is named after him. He was also \nthe chairperson of the Calendar Reform Committee.\n11.3 \u0007Are Festivals Related to Astronomical \nPhenomena?\nMany Indian festivals are tied to the phases \nof the Moon and hence are based on either \nlunar or luni-solar calendars. For instance, \nDiwali falls on the new Moon of the month of \nKartika, Holi on the full Moon of Phalguna, \nBuddha Purnima on the full Moon of Vaisakha, Eid-ul-Fitr is \ncelebrated after sighting the crescent Moon at the end of the \nmonth of Ramazan, while Dussehra is celebrated on the tenth \nday in the month of Ashwina. Hence, they occur on different dates \nin the Gregorian calendar in successive years.\nFor festivals based on luni-solar calendars, the Gregorian \ncalendar dates can shift, but this shift is typically less than \na month. This is because the luni-solar calendars add the \nintercalary month every few years which correct for the \ndifference between the lunar and the solar year. In contrast, \npurely lunar calendars do not account for this difference. \nAny festival celebrated according to the phases of the Moon, \nsuch as Eid-ul-fitr, therefore can occur in different months of \nthe Gregorian calendar year after year.\nWhy do most Indian \nfestivals fall on different \ndates every year?\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nA step further\nA few festivals in India, like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bihu, Vaisakhi, \nPoila Baisakh, and Puthandu, follow a solar sidereal calendar. \nThese festivals happen on almost the same date every year in the \nGregorian calendar which is based on the tropical year.\nA long time ago, these festivals were tied to either a solstice or \nan equinox. Due to the small difference in the sidereal and tropical \nyears, the dates of these festivals slowly shift away from the \nsolstices/equinoxes. This shift is due to slow wobble of the Earth’s \naxis, similar to the movement of the axis of a wobbling top. \nThis causes the dates of festivals based on the sidereal calendar \nto move ahead in tropical calendar. For example, Makar Sankranti \nmoves ahead by one day every 71 years.\nEver heard of ...\nThe dates of many Indian festivals are based on the exact lunar \nphase at sunrise. As sunrise occurs earlier in Eastern India and \nlater in Western India, these dates can also shift by a day between \nthese regions even in the same year. To maintain uniformity \nthroughout the country, the Positional Astronomy Center of the \nGovernment of India annually publishes the Rashtriya panchang, \na detailed calculation of the positions of celestial objects, such as \nthe Moon and the Sun for a central location in India. Based on \nthese calculations, it provides an advance intimation on dates of \nfestivals to Government of India for holiday declaration.\nEver heard of ...\nThe Moon and moonlight have inspired ragas in Indian classical \nmusic. Chandrakauns, Chandranandan, and Shubhapantuvarali \n(which also means “auspicious moon”) are a few ragas that display \nthe moon’s imagery in their names and melodic expressions. \nSimilarly, mudras (hand gestures), for example, Chandrakala, and \nArdhachandran relating to the Moon can be found in Indian classical \ndance Bharatanatyam.\nThe same is true for other dance forms — Kathak, Odissi, and \nKuchipudi. \nEven \nthe \ntraditional painting styles: \nMadhubani, Warli, and other \nforms of art, such as sculpture \nand pottery among Saura, \nGond and other tribes invoke \ndepictions of the Moon and \nthe Sun prominently implying \ntheir significance in daily life.\nDhokra Brass \nsculpture\nWarli painting\nChapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies\nWhen I look at the night \nsky in early evening, I \nsee some moving stars. \nWhat are they?

Besides the Moon, man-made \nsatellites sent by various countries also orbit \nthe Earth. These artificial satellites appear as \ntiny specks moving in the night sky. Most orbit \nabout 800 km above Earth’s surface and take \nroughly 100 minutes to complete one orbit.\nThese satellites help us in many ways like communication, \nnavigation, weather monitoring, disaster management, and \nscientific research. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) \nhas launched many satellites that support these activities.\nThe Cartosat series of satellites, launched by ISRO, capture high-quality \nimages of the Earth to improve maps, plan cities, and handle natural \ndisasters in India. One such mapping platform, Bhuvan, uses these \nimages to show terrain, soil, land use, vegetation, and more.\nAstroSat, another ISRO mission, makes scientific observations of \nstars and other celestial objects. India’s other space missions include \nChandrayaan 1, 2, and 3 to the Moon; Aditya L1 to study the Sun; and \nMangalyaan to Mars.

After their useful life, many of them and their rocket \nparts become space junk or space debris. This debris crowds space, \nand could collide with working satellites.

When vegetation is scarce and \nwaterholes dry up in their natural habitat, elephants may wander \nin to nearby farms or plantations in search of food like bananas \nand sugarcane. This can lead to in crop damage and at times, even \nharm people and domestic animals. \nChanges in rainfall and temperature affect vegetation. Cutting \ndown trees for constructing roads and buildings makes it worse. \nThis leads to the shrinking and drying of forests, the natural home \nof animals. When forests cannot support wildlife, animals tend to \nmove into human habitats. Elephants are adapted to forest life, \nbut sudden changes make it hard for them to survive. Wildlife \necologists have identified  and marked corridors in many parts of \nthe country to allow safe movement of animals. These corridors \ncorrect forest habitats, enabling wildlife—such as elephants to \ntravel in need between large forest areas without coming into \nconflict with human settlements.\nThis chain of events shows how closely nature’s elements are \nconnected. To understand such interconnections, we must study \nthe components of our environment.\n12.1 \u0007How Do We Experience and Interpret \nOur Surroundings?\nYou have learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Diversity in the \nLiving World’ that different habitats have different kinds of plants \nand animals. A habitat is simply place where an organism lives. \nIt could even be just the bark of a tree. The plants and animals \ninteract with each other and adapt to survive in the surrounding \nconditions they live in. Explore two nearby habitats and identify \nboth the living organisms and the non-living components in each.\nActivity 12.1: Let us explore\nCaution: Explore the habitat in groups with your teacher.\n\t\nz Identify two habitats in your surroundings. \n\t\nz These could be any two of the following: a pond, a forest, an \nagricultural farm, or even a large tree like banyan, mango, \nor pilkhan (white fig) tree.\n\t\nz List the living beings and non-living things that you observe \nin these habitats.\n\t\nz Record your observations in Table 12.1.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nPond\nForest\nLiving beings\nNon-living things\nLiving beings\nNon-living things\nFish\nWater\nPlants\nSoil\nGrass\nTrees\nBirds\nTable 12.1: Diﬀerent components of two habitats\nWhat common characteristics do \nyou observe in the two habitats in \nActivity 12.1? The similarities are that \nboth habitats have living beings as \nwell as non-living things. However, \nthe types of living beings are different \nand the non-living things also vary. \nThe living beings you have recorded \nin Table 12.1 are termed as the \nbiotic components and non-living \nthings as the abiotic components of \na habitat. Have you wondered why \nsome organisms live on land while \nothers live in water? Every organism \nneeds specific conditions to survive. \nFrom this activity, you can see that \ndifferent \nhabitats \noffer \ndifferent \nliving conditions.\nIn Activity 12.1, you listed fish as \na biotic component of the pond. How \ndo fish survive in a pond? A pond \nprovides food, oxygen, shelter, and \nspace to grow — conditions essential \nfor survival of organisms. Fish obtain \ntheir biotic needs, such as food, from \nsmall plants and animals, and abiotic \nneeds, such as oxygen, from water.\nOther living beings also inhabit the pond, such as frogs, fresh \nturtles, snakes, dragonflies, mosquitos, snails, and ducks, along \nwith plants like algae, diatoms, duckweeds, and lotus. They all \ninteract with the other living beings and non-living things present \nin the places where they grow and thrive. \n(a) Pond habitat\nFig. 12.1: Two types of habitats\n(b) Forest habitat\nChapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony\nEach habitat has its own biotic components and physical \nconditions — air, sunlight, water, temperature, and soil. \nDifferent organisms living in the same habitat may use the \nresources in different ways. A forest might be warm during \nthe day and cool at night. A snake that comes out at night and a \nrodent active during the day both live in the same habitat, but they \nface different conditions. This is how living organisms coexist in \nharmony in the same habitat.\n12.2 Who All Live Together in Nature? \nYou have observed fish in a pond in Activity 12.1. Did you see \nonly a single fish? Most likely, you may have seen many fish of \nthe same kind. This group of fish of the same kind living together \nin a pond habitat is called a population of that particular fish. \nIn this way, we can observe and record populations of different \nkinds of organisms in a single habitat. \nActivity 12.2: Let us record\nWe can understand the population of a particular type of plant \nby counting them at a given place and time. \n\t\nz Divide students into four to five groups. \n\t\nz Each group may identify any two organisms, plant(s) or \nanimal(s).\n\t\nz Mark an area of 1 m × 1 m in your school garden.\n\t\nz Identify four organisms in this area, and count their numbers. \n\t\nz Record the number of the organisms in Table 12.2.\n\t\nz Compile the data from all groups.\nName of organism\nPopulation (Number of individual \norganisms)\nPlant 1:\t\nPlant 2 :\t\nAnimal 1 :\t\nAnimal 2 :\t\nTable 12.2: Number of particular organisms at a given space \nand time\nIn the given example, there is a population of 20 ______ \nplants and is only 5 ______ plants in the same 1 × 1 m2 area. \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nFrom Activity 12.2, we can explain that the population is a group \nof the same type of organisms in a habitat at a given time. \nCan a habitat have only one type of living organism? What might \nhappen then? If all organisms are the same, they would have the \nsame requirements — food, water, space — leading to competition and \npossible scarcity of resources. What else do you think could happen?\nIn Activities 12.1 and 12.2, you observed that different \ngroup of organisms live together in a habitat. A community \ncomprises different populations sharing the same habitat. The \nbiotic components of a habitat, such as the plants, animals, and \nmicroorganisms together form the community. These organisms \ninteract and depend on one another for survival.\nEver heard of ...\nYou may have seen brightly coloured flowers blooming around you. \nHave you ever looked closely at their parts? A flower has a stalk, green \nleafy structures called sepals, coloured petals and two reproductive \nparts. Carpels (female) and stamens (male). \nStamens burst release yellow dust like pollen \ngrains. Wind, ‘water insects, bats and birds  helps \ncarry pollen from the stamens to the carpels of \nthe same and different flowers. This process is \ncalled pollination (Fig.12.2). It is essential for \nthe formation of fruits and seeds.\nFig. 12.2: Insect \npollination \n12.3 \u0007Does Every Organism in a Community \nMatter?\nLet us find out the role of different organisms in a community.\nActivity 12.3: Let us read\n\t\nz Researchers conducted a study to see how fish in ponds \naffect seed production in the plants nearby. They observed \nFig. 12.3: Pond A with fish and Pond B without fish \nPond A\nPond B\nChapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony\ntwo ponds — A with fish and large number \nof flowering plants around it; B without \nfish and fewer flowering plants around \nit (Fig. 12.3). Think of a reason for these \nobservations.\n\t\nz Compare \nthe \nnumber \nof \ndragonflies, \nbees, and butterflies in both the ponds. \nDo you find any relationship between the \nnumber of dragonflies and bees/butterflies? \nWe  observed that in Pond A (with fish) \nthe number of dragonflies were less as \ncompared to Pond B. Why?\n\t\nz Fish eat dragonfly larvae, so ponds with fish \nhad fewer dragonflies. Dragonflies usually \neat flies, bees and butterflies With fewer \ndragonflies, more bees, flies, and butterflies \nwere found. These insects help pollinate flowers from nearby \nareas moving pollen from one flower to another, which helps \nplants produce seeds. So, flowers near ponds with fish may \nproduce more seeds than those near ponds without fish.\n\t\nz What does this study show? How does the population of fish \nin a pond affect the seed production in nearby plants?  \n\t\nz This study shows how biotic components (fish, dragonflies, \npollinators, plants) and abiotic components (temperature, \nwater, nutrients) interact with and affect each other \n(Fig. 12.4). Similarly, can overfishing by humans change this \nbalance? How do you think it may affect the living and \nnon-living parts of the habitat?\n12.4 \u0007What Are the Different Types of Interactions \nAmong Organisms and their Surroundings?\nIn Curiosity, Grade 7, you learn about how \nplants and animals need air, water, soil, and \nsunlight to grow. Living organisms, or the biotic \ncommunity, depend on non-living things, that \nis abiotic components for their survival. Plants \nand animals also depend on each other for \nnutrition, respiration, and reproduction. These are \ninteractions among the biotic components. Both \ntypes of interactions — among biotic components, \nand between biotic and abiotic components — are \nimportant for survival in any habitat.\nFig. 12.5: Biotic and abiotic interactions\nFig. 12.4: Fish have indirect effect on plants \nin and around ponds.

From \nthis, you can infer that the biotic components \n(plants, animals, and microorganisms) and the \nabiotic components (air, water, soil, sunlight, \nand temperature) in a habitat interact with each \nother to form an ecosystem. Organisms in an \necosystem interact with abiotic components \nfor \nfood, \nshelter, \nand \nprotection \nin \nan \necosystem. Different communities of living \norganisms interact with abiotic components \nin an ecosystems. There are two main types \nof ecosystems in nature. Aquatic ecosystems \ninclude ponds, rivers, and lakes while terrestrial \necosystems include forests, farms or even large trees like banyan, \nmango, or pilkhan. Hence, ecosystems can be large or small. Can \nyou find overlapping ecosystems in Fig. 12.6? \nFig. 12.6 shows an overlap of different terrestrial and \naquatic ecosystems. In this figure, you can see a small river (an \naquatic ecosystem) along with mountains, forests, grassland, \nand farmland, which are examples of terrestrial ecosystems. \nFarmland is a human-made ecosystem. These ecosystems are \ninteracting with each other at any given point.\nIn Activity 12.4, we have seen the importance of the components \nand their interactions in an ecosystem. For example, sunlight, \ncarbon dioxide, and water are essential for producing food in plants; \nsoil provides medium and essential nutrients for plant growth; air \nprovides oxygen for respiration in plants as well as animals; water is \nessential for all living organisms. This shows how living organisms \ndepend on the non-living component of an ecosystem.\nJust as biotic components depend on abiotic components, abiotic \ncomponents also depend on biotic components. For example, \nplants release oxygen during photosynthesis, roots hold soil in \nplace and prevent erosion, and plants retain soil moisture and \nhelp cool the atmosphere.\nYou can identify and study any ecosystem in your surroundings \nand observe different types of interactions among the biotic and \nabiotic components. While studying biotic interactions, notice \nhow organisms depend on each other for food.\nActivity 12.5: Let us classify\nObserve Fig 12.1b, which illustrates a forest ecosystem.\n\t\nz Study the picture carefully and spot the organisms listed in \nTable 12.4.\nFig. 12.7: Individual \nto ecosystem\nCommunity\nPopulation\nEcosystem\nIndividual\nFig. 12.6: Overlap of terrestrial and \naquatic ecosystems\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n\t\nz Using the internet or your school library, find out what do \nthese organisms eat.\n\t\nz Record your observations in Table 12.4 by identifying whether \neach organism feeds only on plants and plant products, only \non animals, or on both.\nName of the \norganism\nPerforms  \nphotosynthesis\nFeeds on \nplants and \nplant products\nFeeds on \nanimals\nFeeds on \nboth plants \nand/or \nanimals\nDeer\nNo\nGrass and leaves \nof plants\nNo\nOnly on plants\nHorse\nVulture\nBengal Fox\nBird (Shikra)\nSquirrel \nMouse\nMushroom\nTree\nYes\nTable 12.4:  Eating habits of different organisms \nHow do plants get their food? As you know, plants make their \nown food by the process of photosynthesis. Thus, they are called \nproducers or autotrophs (auto=self + troph=food).\nOrganisms that cannot produce their own food and depend \non other organisms for their food are called consumers or \nheterotrophs (hetero = other + troph = food). List the heterotrophs \nfrom Table 12.4.\nOrganisms that eat only plants are called herbivores, such \nas deer and hare. Those that eat only animals are carnivores, \nsuch as leopard. Organisms that eat both plants and animals are \nomnivores, such as crows, foxes, and mice.\n12.5 Who Eats Whom?\nIn Activity 12.5, we learn about the feeding relationship \namong organisms. How can we make linkages with the feeding \nrelationship among organisms in a given ecosystem? \nFig. 12.8: Food chain\nChapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony\nActivity 12.6: Let us link (relate)\n\t\nz Take an example of a grassland ecosystem. \n\t\nz Consider the following organisms that we can spot in a \ngrassland ecosystem: grass, frog, hare, fox, grasshopper, \nsnake, and eagle.\n\t\nz In Fig. 12.8, a relationship of who eats whom is shown among \nsome of the organisms.\n\t\nz Draw the feeding relationships for the remaining organisms by \nadding arrows, similar to those in Fig. 12.8.\nIn Fig 12.8, you can see that the grass is eaten by the hare and the \nhare is eaten by the fox. This is a representation of a food chain \nin a grassland ecosystem. Which is another food chain that can \nbe drawn for the organisms given in this activity? One example \nmay be as follows: \nGrass \n Grasshopper \n Frog \n Snake \n Eagle\nThe interactions between biotic components based on feeding \nrelationships can be represented in the form of a linear chain. \nA food chain is a simple sequence showing ‘who eats whom’ in \nan ecosystem. One such example is given in Fig. 12.9. \nActivity 12.7: Let us draw\nFig. 12.10a represents a crop field with millets, mouse, and eagle.\n\t\nz Count the number of each type of organism in Fig. 12.10a.\n\t\nz Make a table and set a number in the table against each of \nthe organisms. \n\t\nz Arrange the numbers in the ascending \norder, consider the highest number at \nthe base and the lowest at the top.\n\t\nz Place the mouse, millet, and eagle \nappropriately in Fig. 12.10b.\n\t\nz What figure do you get? It looks like \na pyramid. Complete the pyramid in \nFig. 12.10b. \nEach organism in a food chain has a \nspecific position, called a trophic level \n(troph = food):\n\t\nz Producers (like green plants) are at \nthe first trophic level.\nFig. 12.9: Another food \nchain in a grassland\nFig. 12.10: (a) Food chain of millet, mouse,  \nand eagle in a crop field\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n\t\nz Herbivores (like hares and deer) are at the second \nlevel.\n\t\nz Small carnivores (like frogs) are at the third level.\n\t\nz \u0007Large carnivores (like tigers or vultures) occupy the \nnext level.\nActivity 12.8: Let us trace and link\n\t\nz Look at Fig. 12.11. \n\t\nz Look at the figure and put more arrows for the \nFig. 12.11: Food web\nGrasses\nGrasshopper \nBird \nFrog\nSnake \nHawk \nFox\nRabbit\nMouse\nOwl\nFig. 12.12: Mushroom growing \non dead organic matter\nFig. 12.10: (b) Food chain \nrepresented in a pyramid\nmissing relationship of ‘who \neats whom’.\n\t\nz How many other organisms \nmight be connected to one \norganism through a feeding \nrelationship in an ecosystem?\nLook \nat \nFig. \n12.11, \nand \nobserve \nthe \nrelationship \nbetween different food chains \nin an ecosystem. Are these food \nchains interlinked? Each of the \norganisms may be eaten by two \nor more types of organisms. \nThus, in an ecosystem, the food \nchains are interlinked with each \nother to form a network, called a \nfood web. \nYou know that living organisms \ngrow, perform many functions, \ndevelop, and die. During their life \ncycle, organisms produce a lot of \nwaste, including dead matter and \nfood waste.\n12.6 What Happens to Waste in Nature? \nYou may have seen small umbrella-like structures, \nmushrooms, growing on dead plants or trees during the \nrainy season (Fig.  12.12). These are a type of fungi that \ngrow on dead matter. Microorganisms like fungi and \nbacteria break down complex substances in dead plants \nand animals into simpler ones. This  process returns \nChapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony\nimportant nutrients to the soil. You can also find tiny insects, \nsuch as beetles and flies, on animal droppings — like elephant \ndung— as they help break it down and recycle nutrients, back into \nthe environment. This process is called decomposition and the \norganisms carrying out the process are called decomposers or \nsaprotrophs (sapro= rotten + trophs = food). Plants grow in soil \nand many of the nutrients in soil come from the decomposition \nprocess. Thus, decomposers play an important role in recycling \nnutrients. In nature, nothing is wasted — everything is reused. \nDoes nature really waste anything?\nEver heard of ...\nIndia is a country with diverse habitats and seasons. Many migratory \nbirds fly thousands of miles and reach different habitats in India. They \nmigrate from different parts of the world to avoid harsh climate, and in \nsearch for food. Birds not only enhance the aesthetics of those habitats \nbut also play a significant role in keeping the balance in an ecosystem \nas pollinators or seed dispersers along the path they migrate. This \nway they link two habitats. These birds are predators of insect pests \nand help farmers to control pest populations, and indirectly help \nin healthy crop growth. Migratory birds, Demoiselle Crane visit the \nwater body of Khichan village in Jodhpur district during the winter \nmonths. Do you know which birds in your area are seen only during \nwinter? Collect postal stamps and covers of migratory birds released \nby the Indian Postal Department, and collect information about their \nplace of origin and reasons for their migration to different localities \nin India and more. Showcase the postal stamps in your science \nlaboratory/school library to popularise migratory birds.\n12.7 How Does One Change Lead to Another? \nLook at Fig. 12.13. It shows how one small change can lead to \nmany others. For example, many plants in a pond start dying \nbecause of pollution. With fewer plants less oxygen will be \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nproduced in water which will lead to a drop in the \nfish population in that water body. Reduction in fish \npopulation will have cascading effects and there will \nbe less number of consumers in the pond. As a result, \ninsects will increase in number. These insects will \nspread to nearby farmlands. This is how farmers will \nbe compelled to use pesticides to grow their crops \nwhich may again adversely affect the environment. \nFurther consequences may emerge in the form of \nother environmental issues.\nPlants die\nLess oxygen\nFish die\nMore insects\nPlants get \ndamaged by \npests\nFig. 12.13: One change \nleads to another\nWhat happens when we intervene in nature?\nActivity 12.9: Let us read\nIn the 1980s, India was a significant exporter of frog \nlegs, especially of the Indian bullfrog (Hoplobatrachus \ntigerinus) (Fig. 12.14). This large-scale harvesting led \nto a decline in frog populations. Since frogs eat insects, \ntheir reduced numbers resulted in a rise in agricultural \npests. This forced farmers to use more synthetic \npesticides, which harmed the environment, soil and \nwater quality, and affected the overall environmental \nand human health. The Government of India banned \nthe export of frog legs to prevent further ecological \ndamage. \nAn ecosystem stays in balance when interactions \namong organisms and their environment keep \npopulations and resources stable. This balance is \ndynamic, not fixed, and can be disrupted by natural \nor human-made changes.\nFig. 12.14: Indian bullfrog\nFig. 12.15: Competition among a \ncommunity in an ecosystem\n12.8 \u0007How Do Interactions Maintain \nBalance in Ecosystems?\nBesides feeding relationships, organisms also \ncompete for common resources like food, water, \nphysical space, or sunlight.  \nThis competition helps control population \nsize and keeps the ecosystem balanced. Without \nit, one species could multiply too much causing \nan imbalance in the ecosystem (Fig. 12.15).\nThere are other types of relationships too. \nBased on the example given in Fig. 12.16, what \ndo you observe?\nChapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony\n\t\nz Mutualism: Both organisms \nbenefit. \nFor \nexample: \nHoneybees and flowers.\n\t\nz Commensalism: One organism \nbenefits while the other is not \naffected.

Johnsingh) \nwas a famous Indian wildlife biologist who helped \nus understand forest ecosystems through the eyes of \nanimals. He was a pioneer in studying wildlife through \nmodern tracking system. His research showed how \npredators like tigers and leopards rely on prey, such as \ndeer and wild boar, while he was working in Bandipur \nNational Park, Karnataka. He proved that a healthy prey \npopulation is key to predator survival. He inspired many youngsters \nto study wildlife and protect the forests and biodiversity of India.\n12.9 What Are the Benefits of an Ecosystem?\nWe have learnt that biotic components and abiotic components \nof an ecosystem depend on each other and support various life \nprocesses. Humans also benefit from ecosystems. For example, \nforests provide fresh air, fertile soil, food, fibres, timber, and \nmedicines. Similarly, aquatic ecosystems provide water and \nfood. Ecosystems also offer aesthetic and recreational value. \nThis benefits and supports our well-being and shows how closely \nnature and humans are connected. However, when we overuse \nor misuse natural resources, we disturb the balance in nature.\nNow let us look at a real-life example of a threatened ecosystem \n— the Sundarbans.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nThe \nSundarbans \nhave \nthe \nlargest mangrove forests in the \nworld. Located where the Ganges \nand \nBrahmaputra \nRivers \nmeet \nbetween India and Bangladesh, the \nSundarbans’ forests and rivers are \nhome to various flora and fauna, \nmany of which are endangered. The \nSundarbans protect us by slowing \ndown strong winds and waves \nduring storms and floods. The trees \nalso absorb carbon dioxide from \nthe air and release oxygen. Because \nof its importance, The United \nNations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the Sundarbans a World \nHeritage Site in 1987. However, the Sundarbans (Fig.  12.17) are \nunder a serious threat. Mangrove trees are being cut for fuelwood \nand farming. Illegal hunting and overuse of forest resources are \na threat to the wildlife living there. Pollution from industrial \nwaste and untreated sewage in rivers are also damaging the \nwater and habitat. These human activities disrupt the natural way \necosystems work.\nSimilarly, other ecosystems across India are also under threat. \nProblems like deforestation, overuse of natural resources, the \nspread of invasive species, unsustainable land use, and pollution \nare damaging forests, rivers, scrublands, wetlands, grasslands, \nand coastal areas.\nHow can we stop damaging forests, rivers, and wetlands? \nThink about what actions you and your community can take to \nprotect these important places.\nProtected areas are parts of land or water set aside to conserve wildlife \nand their habitats. India has many protected areas like national parks, \nwildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and community conserved \nareas. These places help protect entire habitats including endangered \nanimals, birds, and many rare plants. Famous examples include Jim \nCorbett National Park (Uttarakhand), Manas National Park (Assam), \nNilgiri Biosphere Reserve (Western Ghats), Chilika Lake (Odisha), \nEaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh), Hemis National \nPark (Leh), Keibul Lamjao National Park (Manipur), Pirotan Island \nMarine National Park (Gujarat). Protected areas play a big role in \nsaving nature for future generations.\nOur scientific heritage\nFig. 12.17: Mangrove forest in Sundarbans\nChapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony\n12.9.1 Human-made ecosystems\nHumans have created artificial ecosystems like fish ponds, \nfarms, and parks to meet their needs. When well designed, these \ncan help reduce pollution, support biodiversity, and provide \nrecreational spaces for people. Unlike natural ecosystems, these \nneed human care and management. Can you name any human \nmade ecosystem in your area?\n12.9.2 How do healthy ecosystems serve our farms?\nFarming, a major livelihood in India, can become unsustainable \nif not managed well by applying environment friendly farming \npractices.\nHumans have been practising farming for thousands of \nyears to grow food. As the population grew, our dependence on \nagriculture increased. Between 1950 and 1965, India faced a food \ncrisis due to low crop production. In the mid-20th century, the \nuse of tractors, machines, synthetic fertilisers, and pesticides \nhelped increase food production. This period is known as the \nGreen Revolution. However, these farming methods are now \nconsidered unsustainable because of the overuse of synthetic \nchemicals, excessive groundwater extraction, and growing only \none type of crop for commercial gain. How do these practices \nharm both the environment and human health?\nMany scientists believe that overusing pesticides and growing \nthe same type of crop repeatedly on the same land leads to soil \ndegradation. Understanding ecosystems can help us adopt better \nand more sustainable farming practices.\nActivity 12.10: Let us survey\nVisit a nearby farm with your parents or teacher/interact with \nfarmers in your community to find out about the farming \npractices they adopt.\n\t\nz Prepare a list of questions for farmers to find out the \npesticides and other farm inputs they use, and whether they \nreuse or recycle materials to improve their crops. Here are \nsome sample questions:\n\t\n{\nHow have your farming practices changed over time? \nAnd why?\n\t\n{\nWhat effects do you notice when using synthetic fertilisers \nand pesticides?\n\t\n{\nHave you seen any changes in soil health after using these \nsynthetic fertilisers and pesticides?\n\t\nz Interact with farmers based on these questions. Based on \nyour findings, prepare a report.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nWhat inference do you draw from your \ninteractions with farmers?\nSynthetic fertilisers and pesticides have played \na vital role in improving crop production and \nhelped countries like India become food secure. \nHowever, their long-term use can affect the \nenvironment and soil health. Overuse of synthetic \nfertilisers may reduce soil fertility by decreasing \nfriendly microorganisms in soil and lowering \norganic matter (humus), which helps bind soil \nparticles. Without enough humus, soil becomes \nprone to erosion. Also, it reduces the population of \nnatural predators which ultimately increase the \npopulation of pests (Fig. 12.18). Heavy irrigation and repeated \nploughing can also disturb soil organisms like earthworms and \nsnails, which are important for maintaining ecological balance.\nSome pests may develop resistance to pesticides, making them \ndifficult to control. Growing the same crop repeatedly, known as \nmonoculture, can reduce crop diversity and affect pollinators, \nwhich are crucial for food production. \nTo make farming more sustainable, some farmers are \nexploring organic and natural farming methods. These aim to \nreduce the use of synthetic fertilisers and support sustainable \nfarming, with minimal interference in natural ecosystems. \nBased on your learning, what practices do you think can help \nfarmers protect the soil, the environment, and our food security \nfor the future?\nThe ancient text Vrikshayurveda emphasises on soil health and \nnourishment. The text strongly advocates for the continuous \nnourishment of the soil through organic manure like Kunapa Jala (a \nliquid fertiliser made from animal and plant waste by the process of \nfermentation; that breaks complex substances into simpler ones) and \nother composted materials.\nOur scientific heritage\nSnapshots  \n\t\n\nA habitat is a place that provides the right conditions for an organism \nto live and grow.\nFig. 12.18: Natural control of pests by \npredators—Beetle feeding on pests\nChapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony\n\t\n\nHabitats have biotic components (plants, animals, microbes) and \nabiotic components (air, water, soil, temperature).\n\t\n\nThe interaction between biotic components and abiotic components \nin an area forms an ecosystem.\n\t\n\nEcosystems can be terrestrial (forests, grasslands, deserts) or aquatic \n(ponds, lakes, sea, oceans).\n\t\n\nOrganisms often classified as producers (plants), consumers \n(herbivores, carnivores, omnivores), and decomposers (bacteria, \nfungi).\n\t\n\nProducers make their own food, while consumers eat plants \nor animals.

They provide clean air, water, food, medicine, and \nclimate regulation.\n\t\n\nHuman activities like pollution, deforestation, habitat loss, climate \nchange, invasive species, and overexploitation of natural resources \nthreaten ecosystems.

It is time to put together all that we have seen and learnt \nand try to understand why our home, planet Earth, is like \nno other place in the known universe. As you have learnt in \nCuriosity, Grades 6 and 7, the Earth is a planet orbiting the Sun. \nHowever, it is not just any planet. It is a planet that sustains \nlife — full of diverse landscapes, from towering mountains \nand vast oceans to endless deserts and lush forests. Today, our \nsatellites allow us to take amazing pictures of our planet. The \nimage in the beginning  page was taken by an Indian Space \nResearch Organisation (ISRO) Earth Observation Satellite and \nmade by combining nearly 3000 smaller images, like pieces of \na mosaic. Although it looks beautiful, it’s a false colour image, \nwhere scientists use different colours to show different types of \ninformation. These satellite images help us study plants on land \nand tiny organisms in the ocean, and can even detect things \nlike ocean temperature, oil spills, and wind direction. In this \nchapter, we will uncover the unique conditions that make Earth \nthe perfect home for living beings.\n13.1 Why Is Earth a Unique Planet?\nWhat makes the Earth so special? While there are perhaps \nbillions of planets in the universe, Earth is the only one where \nlife, as we know today, exists and thrives in all its forms.\nHave you ever wondered \nwhere all life on Earth \nactually \nexists? \nAll \nthe \nmountains, rivers, forests, \nanimals, and people are \nfound on just a very thin \nlayer on the surface of our \nplanet. From the tallest \nmountain to the deepest \nocean trench, the crust, \nwhere all of life exists, is \ntiny compared to the size of \nEarth. If Earth were the size \nof an apple, the crust would \nbe as thin as the apple’s \nskin as shown in Fig. 13.1. \nThis delicate, life supporting layer is what makes Earth truly \nspecial.\ncrust\nFig. 13.1: The Earth’s crust is like the thin skin of an apple \nCrust\nUpper mantle\nLower mantle\nOuter core\nInner core\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nLet us conduct an activity to list out some features of the \nEarth that you think make it special.\nActivity 13.1: Let us find out\n\t\nz List some features of the Earth that we often take for \ngranted, but are interesting and important to us. Write them \nin Table 13.1. We have filled in a few for you.\nS.No.\nInteresting features of the Earth\n1.\nThe air we breathe doesn’t fly off and disappear into space. \n(We learnt in Chapter 7 that the particles of a gas move freely, \nand gases do not have a fixed volume)\n2.\nWe can stand on the ground held by gravity (as we learnt in \nChapter 5), but our heart can pump blood up to our head.\n3.\n4.\nTable 13.1: Interesting features about the Earth\nDiscuss the features you have listed with your teacher and \nfriends. You may realise that the Earth is interesting and important \nto us in many ways. It provides us with the air that we breathe, the \nwater that we drink, and the soil that helps in growing crops. The \nEarth also provides us materials like rock and timber with which \nwe build our homes, buildings, and roads. You must be curious \nto know what makes the Earth a unique planet which not only \nallows life like us to exist but also sustains it.\n13.2 \u0007What Do the Planets of Our Solar System \nLook Like?\nIn Curiosity, Grade 6, you had studied the solar system in the \nchapter ‘Beyond Earth’. Let us recall some of the things we had \nlearnt. Our solar system has eight planets that go around the Sun \nin nearly circular orbits. In order of their increasing distance \nfrom the Sun, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, \nI wonder what makes the Earth \nunique for living beings to grow \nand survive!\nChapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet\nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Out of all these planets, Mercury, \nVenus, Earth, and Mars, are relatively small and rocky planets, \nwhile Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are large planets, \nmostly made of gases.\nLet us find out more about the planets in the solar system by \nperforming Activity 13.2.\nActivity 13.2: Let us find out\n\t\nz Collect information about the temperature and size of \nthe planets in the solar system, and check if they have an \natmosphere.\n\t\nz You may collect this information from books in your school \nlibrary, trusted websites, or discuss with your teachers.\n\t\nz Fill out the missing information in Table 13.2.\nS.No.\nPlanet\nAverage \ntemperature \n(oC)\nRadius, \ncompared to \nthe Earth\nHas an \natmosphere?\n1.\nMercury\nNo\n2.\nVenus\n0.95\nYes\n3.\nEarth\n1\nYes\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n–200\nTable 13.2: Planets in our solar system\nWe know that all planets in the solar system get their energy \nfrom the Sun. Thus, when a planet is close to the Sun, it would \nbe very hot. As we move away from the Sun, planets should get \ncolder. Is this what you found in Table 13.2? This is generally \ncorrect, except that Venus, the second planet from the Sun has \nthe highest average temperature and is the hottest planet. Why is \nthis so? \nVenus is the hottest planet not because it is the closest \nto the Sun, but because its thick atmosphere traps heat. \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nThe air on Venus is almost entirely made up of carbon \ndioxide gas, which does not let the heat escape. This \nis called the greenhouse effect (Fig. 13.2), and it \nmakes Venus even hotter than Mercury, which is \nrelatively closer to the Sun. On the Earth also, gases \nlike carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat \nby absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, \nafter it gets warmed by the Sun. Thus, greenhouse \neffect plays an important role in maintaining just \nthe right temperature on Earth.\nA step further\nThe greenhouse effect that causes \na planet like Venus and Earth to \ntrap heat does not work the same \nway as a greenhouse for growing \nplants in a cool climate. On Venus \nor Earth, gases like carbon dioxide \nin the atmosphere trap heat by \nabsorbing the radiation given off \nby the Earth, after it gets warmed \nby the Sun. A plant greenhouse, on \nthe other hand, traps warmed air \nsimply because it is a closed space, usually with glass walls (Fig. 13.3). \nIt heats up during the day, but the air stays in and the heat does not \nescape easily. So while both keep things warm, they do it differently!\nFig. 13.3: Greenhouse for plants\n13.3 What Makes the Earth Suitable for Life to \t\n          Exist ?\n13.3.1 Position of the Earth\nThe most important reason why the Earth \ncan support life is its distance from the \nSun. It is just at the right distance, where \nthe temperature allows water to exist in a \nliquid form. If the Earth were closer to the \nSun, it would be too hot and all the water \nwould evaporate; if it were farther away, \nit would be too cold, and all the water \nwould freeze.  In such extreme conditions, \nit would have been impossible for most \nlife forms — especially plants, animals, and \nhumans — to grow and thrive on Earth. \nAlthough some microbes, like certain \n Fig. 13.4: The habitable zone  \naround a star\nHabitable zone\nToo hot\nJust right\nToo cold\nFig. 13.2: Schematic of greenhouse \neffect on Earth\nChapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet\nbacteria, can survive in frozen environments, from \nwhat we know so far, liquid water is essential for \nlife to evolve. Earth’s distance from the Sun allows \nwater to remain mostly in liquid form, which is \nessential for the development and sustenance of life \nin all its form. The range of distances from the Sun \n(or another star) over which water remains liquid is \ncalled the habitable zone, or sometimes also called \nthe ‘Goldilocks zone’ (Fig. 13.4).\nAs you have also studied in Social Science, most of \nEarth’s surface is covered with water. Thus, when seen \nfrom space, the Earth looks blue because of the vast \namount of water—hence the name Blue Planet (Fig. 13.5).\nDid Mars ever support life?\nMars lies at the edge of the Sun’s habitable zone. Several spacecrafts \nhave been sent to Mars, rovers have landed and explored its surface, \nbut no proof of life has been found yet. However, scientists think \nthat in the past, Mars may have had \nliquid water — maybe even some \nlakes — and conditions that could \nsupport simple life forms (Fig. 13.6). \nThis is one reason Mars continues \nto interest scientists. It also reminds \nus that science doesn’t always have \nfinal answers. As we explore more, \nwe may find new clues—or even \nnew kinds of life. Science stays open \nto change when we learn more.\nFig. 13.6: Mars\nA step further\nIs the temperature or distance from the Sun, the \nonly factor that makes the Earth habitable?\nWhat would happen if the size of the Earth \nwere too small or too big?\n Fig. 13.5: Earth — The blue planet\n13.3.2 Size of the Earth\nThere are some other important factors that make the Earth \nhabitable. In our solar system, the orbits of most planets, \nincluding the Earth are almost circular. This keeps the amount of \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nsunlight and heat nearly steady throughout the year, preventing \nextreme summers and winters at most places. \nHowever, moderate temperature due to the right distance \nfrom the Sun isn’t the only factor that makes the Earth habitable. \nThe planet is also the right size to support an atmosphere. As you \nlearnt earlier, the atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds \nthe Earth, and it plays a major role in sustaining life. You also \nlearnt in Chapter 5 that the Earth’s gravity pulls objects towards it. \nIf Earth were much smaller (but with the same average density), \nits gravity would have been too weak to hold on to the gases in \nour atmosphere, and they would have escaped into space. On \nMars, the atmosphere is 100 times thinner than on Earth, and \nMercury has no atmosphere at all.\nOn the other hand, if the planet was too large, and gravity was \nmuch stronger, it would perhaps pull us down to the planet with \nsuch a large force that our bones could get crushed! Due to the \nright size of the Earth, it is able to support atmosphere which is \nessential for life.\nThe presence of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere allows us \nto breathe, and is needed by almost all forms of life on Earth. \nBut oxygen has another important role. Some of the oxygen in \nour atmosphere, gets converted to another form called ozone \n(a  three-atom oxygen molecule), and forms an important part \nof the atmosphere called the ozone layer. This layer acts like a \nshield, blocking harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun that \ncan damage living cells.\nOur scientific heritage\nIndia’s \nMangalyaan \n(Mars \nOrbiter \nMission), \nlaunched \nin 2013 by Indian Space \nResearch Organisation (ISRO), \nwas a big step in exploring \nMars (Fig.  13.7). It carried \ntools to study the planet’s \natmosphere, surface, and signs \nof past water. Some of these \nsensors help scientists ask \nbig questions — like was Mars \never suitable for life? Mangalyaan showed the world that India could \ndo space science with smart, low-cost technology — and it helped bring \nMars closer to all of us.\nFig. 13.7: Mangalyaan\nChapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet\n13.3.3 Magnetic field of the Earth\nIn Curiosity, Grade 6, we learnt that \na freely suspended magnet always \nsettles in a fixed direction. This is \nbecause the Earth itself behaves \nlike a giant magnet. You have also \nseen in Chapter 4 that the region around a magnet where its \neffect is felt has a magnetic field. It is believed that the movement \nof molten iron in Earth’s core may be the origin for Earth’s \nmagnetic field. \nEarth is constantly hit by tiny, high-energy particles that \ncome from space. Some come from far across the universe and \nare called cosmic rays. Other particles come from the Sun and \nare called the solar wind. These particles can be harmful as they \ncan damage the atmosphere, reduce the ozone layer, and let in \nmore harmful UV rays, which can affect life on Earth.\nThankfully, the Earth’s magnetic field acts like a protective \nshield. It pushes many of these harmful particles away from the \nEarth, keeping our atmosphere, and hence life on our planet safe.\nEarth’s unique position in the solar system — allows the \npresence of liquid water — along with its size, atmosphere, and \nmagnetic field, all help make it a planet where life can emerge \nand thrive.\nBut, how is life supported and \nsustained on Earth?\nDoes the magnetic field of \nthe Earth have any role in \nsustaining life on Earth?\n13.4 What Allows Life to Be Sustained on Earth?\nEarth has the right conditions for life, but it is the beautiful \nconnections between living and non-living things that help life to \nthrive. In Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, you learnt about key natural \nresources, such as, air, water, sunlight, soil, and minerals. \nYou also learnt about the important life processes in plants and \nanimals. Now, let us explore how all these elements interact to \nsupport and sustain life on Earth.\n13.4.1 Air, water, and sunlight\nWe know that the atmosphere contains oxygen, which humans, \nanimals, and plants use for respiration. In the presence of \nsunlight, plants take carbon dioxide from the air and water from \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nthe soil to prepare food by photosynthesis. In the process, oxygen is \nreleased, which is needed for respiration.\nWe have learnt, radiation from the Sun heats the Earth. Some of \nthis heat is trapped by the atmosphere due to the greenhouse \neffect. This effect though mild, keeps the temperature just high \nenough for water to remain in the liquid state. In Curiosity, \nGrade 7, you also learnt about heat transfer by radiation. Without \nan atmosphere, the Earth would lose heat to space and become \ntoo cold. So the greenhouse effect helps keep the Earth warm.\nWater is essential for life. You have learnt that it covers about \n70 per cent of the Earth’s surface and is found in ponds, lakes, \nrivers, springs, seas, oceans, and groundwater. \nAll this water forms the hydrosphere. \nIn Chapter 7, you learnt that water is a good \nsolvent. In Curiosity, Grade 7, we learnt \nhow water transports nutrients from soil to \nleaves in plants. In animals, it regulates body \ntemperature, aids digestion, and ensures \nhydration, all essential for health and life.\nThough much of Earth is covered by \nwater, we still know little about what lives \ndeep in the oceans. The hydrosphere is home \nto millions of life forms, from tiny planktons to giant whales, \nmany still being discovered. Oceans, lakes, and rivers provide \nrich environments for aquatic life (Fig. 13.8). Freshwater is also \nneeded to grow crops and support people around the world.\nWater vapour in the air forms clouds and brings rain or snow. \nThis refills rivers, lakes, and underground water. Rainfall affects \nthe kinds of plants and animals that can live in a place. Moving \nair also shapes weather and rainfall — which influence farming, \nwater supply, and life on land.\n13.4.2 Soil, rocks, and minerals\nBeneath our feet lies something remarkable — the Earth’s crust, \nmade of rocks, soil, and minerals. It may seem hard and lifeless, \nbut it provides almost everything life needs to grow and survive. \nFrom soil that helps plants grow to minerals that give us salt, coal, \noil, and metals like iron and copper — this outer layer support \nboth ecosystems and human life. The solid parts of the Earth, \nincluding materials like rocks, soils, and minerals are known as \nthe geosphere.\nSoil may look like simple dirt, but it is rich in nutrients like \nnitrogen and potassium that plants need to grow. These nutrients \ncome from the slow breakdown of rocks and the remains of \nplants and animals.\n Fig. 13.8: Life in water\nChapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet\nThere are various types of landforms, \nrocks, soils, etc., on Earth. This variety along \nwith the processes that shape and alter them \nis called geodiversity (Fig.  13.9). It helps \ncreate unique habitats where different \ntypes of life can thrive. The non-living parts \nof nature, like soil, rocks, and water, aren’t \njust a background — they help shape the \nstory of life itself.\n13.4.3 Plants, animals, and microorganisms\nFrom the chapter on microbes to the chapter on ecology, we have \nseen that the Earth is full of life — from trees, shrubs, herbs, to \nanimals, insects, and tiny organisms invisible to the naked eye. \nAll living beings, along with the places where they live, make \nup the biosphere. This includes land, water, and air, where life \ninteracts with its surroundings to survive and grow.\nAs you learnt in Chapter 12, living beings depend on one \nanother and their environment. Plants make food through \nphotosynthesis, animals eat plants or other animals, and \ndecomposers break down dead matter and return nutrients to \nthe soil. Nature works together as a system to support life.\n13.4.4 The importance of balance\nHave you ever wondered how so many things on Earth stay in \nbalance? Earth is like a giant teamwork project between nature, \nweather, and life itself. It is a vast, living system where land, air, \nwater, and living things support and affect one another. Even \na small change in one part — like cutting down a forest — can \nimpact rainfall, soil, air quality, and the animals that live there. \nLife on Earth survives not because of just one thing, but because \neverything works together in balance. It is this balance that \nkeeps our planet habitable. That’s why preserving and protecting \nclean air, water, soil, and all forms of life isn’t just important but \nessential for keeping Earth healthy for the future.\n13.5 What Keeps Life from Disappearing?\nIf plants and animals didn’t reproduce, life would eventually \ndisappear from Earth. Reproduction ensures that each type of \norganism continues to exist, maintaining the continuity of life.\nWe usually expect that animals will produce young ones that \nresemble them — cows have calves, and cats have kittens. This \nhappens because parents pass on instructions to their offspring \nabout how to develop from a single cell. These instructions, \n Fig. 13.9: Geodiversity\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\ncalled genetic material or genes, are stored inside every cell of \na living being. You can think of genes as a detailed instruction \nmanual inside each cell. Some instructions tell the cell how to \nmake blood, while others guide the formation of bones, muscles, \nor skin. Together, these instructions ensure that a calf grows into \na cow, or a kitten grows into a cat.\nBut reproduction does more than just create more of the same kind \nof living beings. It also allows for small changes in the instructions \nthat are passed down from parents to offpsrings. Sometimes, these \nchanges help a plant or animal survive better in a new environment. \nFor example, over time, camels developed humps to store fat and \nsurvive in deserts. Even microbes evolve — some bacteria, as you \nlearnt in the chapter on health, have become resistant to antibiotics, \nhelping them persist. Over many generations, such changes can lead \nto new features — or even completely new types of living beings. So, \nreproduction not only keeps each kind continuing, but also helps \nlife adapt change, and continue in new forms (Fig. 13.10).\nBut how can the same process lead both to similarity (an animal \ngives birth to similar individual, such as a cow gives birth to a cow) \nand variation (shows different characteristics like difference in \ncolor and height of to individuals of \nsome kind)? That is a fascinating puzzle. \nThere are two types of reproductive \nprocesses — one in which the young \nare almost exactly like their parent \nand another in which they look slightly \ndifferent from their parents.\nIn asexual reproduction, a single \nparent produces new individuals that \nare exact copies of itself (exact in terms of the instructions inside \nthe cell). In sexual reproduction, instructions from two parents \ncombine to create offspring that are not exactly like either of \nthe parent. They share some traits with both parents, but also \nhave differences. This mixing helps keep useful features while \nallowing new ones to appear. Over many generations, these \nsmall differences can add up — leading to big differences, and \neven new life forms.\nLet’s explore how reproduction takes place in plants and \nanimals, and how it helps living beings develop special features \nand sometimes change over time. \n13.5.1 Asexual reproduction\nMany plants can reproduces when any part of the plants — leaf, \nstem, or root — is planted in soil. This kind of reproduction is \ncalled vegetative propagation. \nFig. 13.10: Development of calf to cow\nChapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet\nCan you observe and list some \nplants around you that grow this \nway?\nActivity 13.3: Let us find out\n\t\nz Take some parts of plants like stem cutting of a money plant, \nthe ‘eyes’ of a sprouted potato, or a piece of ginger (Fig. 13.11b).\n\t\nz Plant each of them separately in moist soil (not too deep). For \nmoney plant, you can just put a cutting in a glass container \nwhich makes it easy to observe.\n\t\nz Make sure they get all the conditions they need to grow—like \nwater, air, and sunlight.\n\t\nz Watch them every day and note how many days it takes for \nroots stem and leaves to appear. Also observe when the first \nnew leaf appears.\nEver heard of ...\nNot just plants – microbes and simple animals also reproduce \nasexually. For example, single-celled organisms like bacteria and \namoebae divide into two identical individuals. Some multicellular \norganisms like algae can regrow from small cut parts. \nHydra, another simple animal, grows tiny buds on its \nbody that break off and grow into new individuals.\nPlanaria, a type of flatworm, can regrow from just \na small piece of their body! Scientists study them to \nunderstand regeneration in animals.\nEver heard of ...\nNot just plants — microbes and simple animals also reproduce \nasexually. For example, single-celled organisms like bacteria and \namoeba divide into two identical individuals. Some multicellular \norganisms like algae can regrow from small cut parts. \nHydra, another simple animal, grows tiny buds on its \nbody that breaks off and grow into new individuals.\nPlanaria (Fig. 13.12), a type of flatworm, can \nregrow from a fragment of its body! Scientists study \nthis organism to understand regeneration in animals.\nFig. 13.12: Planaria\n13.5.2 Sexual reproduction \nIn this type of reproduction, two parents are involved — usually \ncalled male and female. This is easy to observe in animals, but \ndid you know even flowering plants have male and female parts? \nSome microorganisms like bacteria and yeast also have two \n‘mating types’ that act like the two parents.\nSpecial cells for reproduction\nYou might wonder if both parents pass on their genetic material \nfor making a new organism, won’t the child end up with double \nthe amount of instructions? And would not this keep doubling \nevery generation?\nThis does not happen because each parent makes specialised \nreproductive cells, called gametes. These carry only half of the \nparent’s genetic material . When male and female gametes join, \nthey form a new cell with a complete set of instructions — half \nfrom each parent.\nHow do bamboo and sugarcane \ngrow into new plants? I have \nnever seen their seeds.\nFig. 13.11: Vegetative \npropagation — (a) \nGinger; (b) Potato\n(b) \n(a) \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nBabies do not look exactly like their mother or father. Even \nbrothers and sisters in the same family can look different from \neach other. This is because every baby gets a mix of genetic \ninformation from both parents through gametes. Each gamete \ncarries a different set of instructions for things like eye colour, hair \ntype, and more. These instructions mix in different ways when \nthe sperm and eggs joins to form a baby. These instructions mix \nin different ways each time, so each child is unique. No wonder \none child may ‘inherit’ a nose similar to mother and another may \ninherit eyes similar to father. It all depends on which pieces of \nthe parent’s ‘instruction book set’ came together.\nSexual reproduction in plants\nPlants use different parts of their flowers to produce \nmale and female gametes. Pollen grains found inside the \nanther of a flower are the male gametes, while ovules, \nfound deep inside the flower, are the female gametes. \nPollen is carried to another flower by wind, insects, or \nanimals — this process is called pollination. When the \nmale and female gametes combine, it is called fertilisation, \nforming a zygote that becomes the seed. The fleshy part of the \nflower around the ovule develops into a fruit (Fig. 13.13).\nWhen birds or animals eat the fruit, the seeds often get \ndropped far from the original plant — a helpful way for plants \nto spread. That’s how a banyan seed, dropped by a bird that ate \na fruit and excreted the seed, might sprout in a crack in a wall \nafter the rains. When seeds get water, they use stored nutrients \nto grow roots and shoots. Remember in Grade 6 you had studied \nthe germination of seeds where you observed tiny shoots and the \nfirst leaves appear.\nSexual reproduction in animals\nIn animals, gametes are called sperm (male) and eggs \n(female). Fertilisation may take place in water, for example, \nmale and female fish or frogs eject sperm and eggs, \nrespectively, into the water where they combine to form \nthe zygote. In these animals, the development of the zygote \ninto an embryo also takes place in water (Fig. 13.14).\nIn birds and mammals, including humans, sperm \nare deposited inside the female and fertilisation takes \nplace when the sperm swim towards the egg produced \nby the female. After this step, birds and mammals follow \ndifferent processes.\nZygote\nFertilisation\nEgg cell\nSperm cell\nFig. 13.14: Formation of zygote\nOvule\nAnther\nFig. 13.13: A flower\nChapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet\nIn birds, the fertilised egg (zygote) is ‘laid’ by the female. \nThe development of the zygote into an embryo happens after the \negg is laid during the hatching process. Think about how much \n‘food’ the female parent has to put into each egg — it has to last \nfor the developing embryo until it hatches. This is one strategy to \nensures supply of nutrition to the embryo.\nIn most mammals, the development of the zygote into an \nembryo takes place inside the body of the female. The mother’s \nbody provides all the food and oxygen the baby needs to grow \nuntil it is born. This is a different way of giving nutrition to the \ndeveloping baby, compared to animals like birds that lay eggs. \nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of giving birth to \nyoung ones vs. laying eggs? Do you think animals like dogs, cows, \nor humans could lay eggs like birds? Why or why not?\n13.6 What Are the Threats to Life on Earth?\nWe know that life on Earth depends on a delicate balance of \nliving and non-living things working together. But human \nactions are disturbing this balance. Even small changes in \nglobal temperature, oxygen levels, or the ozone layer can put \nlife at risk.\nToday, the biggest environmental challenges that we face \nare climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution — together \nknown as the triple planetary crisis.\nBurning fossil fuels like coal and oil releases greenhouse gases \nlike carbon dioxide and methane. These trap even more heat in \nthe atmosphere which causes global warming. Normally, Earth \nkeeps a balance since trees, plants, and even tiny ocean planktons \nabsorb carbon dioxide as they grow. But when we burn fossil \nfuels, we release extra carbon that has been locked underground \nfor millions of years. The Earth cannot absorb this fast enough, so \nthe heat builds up. Even a small increase in temperature can melt \nice caps, raise sea levels which could flood many coastal cities, \ncause extreme weather conditions, and lead to many plants and \nanimals disappearing. These long-term changes in temperature, \nrainfall, and weather patterns are called climate change. \nWhen natural habitats are destroyed, plants and animals \nmay disappear, upsetting ecosystems. For example, as we saw in \nChapter 12, if grasses vanish, animals that feed on them like deer \nor grasshoppers struggle to survive. And without herbivores, \npredators like tigers or foxes lose their food too. Every type of \nliving thing has a role, and losing even a few weakens nature’s \nability to support life.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nPollution adds to the problem. Air pollution \nfrom factories, vehicles, and burning fuels \nharms both people and the nature. It can \ncause breathing problems, damage crops, \nand lead to smog and acid rain (Fig. 13.15).\nClimate change affects everything—from \ncrop growth and water supply to wildlife \nhabitats and human health. To protect life on \nEarth, we need to cut pollution, use cleaner \nenergy, and make wiser choices. We have \nalso learnt that life on Earth flourishes within \na delicate balance supported by interdependent natural systems. \nHowever, this balance is increasingly threatened by human \nactions. For example, a little less or more of oxygen in air, or a \nlittle lower or higher temperature of the Earth, or a little less of \nozone in the atmosphere, could endanger life on the Earth.\nCountries around the world have made global agreements to protect \nthe environment. The Montreal Protocol (1987) helped reduce \nharmful chemicals like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), allowing the \nozone layer to slowly recover. The Earth Summit (1992) led to \ninternational efforts on climate change and biodiversity. Later, \nthe Kyoto Protocol (2005) and Paris Agreement (2015) committed \ncountries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement \nset a goal to limit global warming to below 1.5 °C, but as of 2025, the \nworld is not on track to meet that goal. Much more action is needed \nto avoid any more adverse effects of climate change.\nEver heard of ...\nWater and soil pollution are serious threats to life \n(Fig.  13.16). Factory, farm and plastic waste harm aquatic \nlife and make water unsafe. Excess fertilisers and poor waste \ndisposal pollute soil, reduce crop yield, and spread harmful \nsubstances through the food chain. Protecting them requires \nbetter waste management and sustainable \nfarming practices.\nWe have seen above that all the Earth system, \nsuch as hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere and \ngeosphere are connected — so damage to one can \naffect the others. Protecting the climate means \ncutting down on greenhouse gases by using \nrenewable energy like solar and wind, improving \nenergy use, and choosing environmentally friendly \nways to travel. At the same time, preserving \nFig. 13.16: Water pollution\nFig. 13.15: Air pollution\nChapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet\nbiodiversity is key as diverse ecosystems are stronger and more \nbalanced. Local communities can play a big role in using natural \nresources sustainably.\nEveryone can help. Reusing, repairing, and recycling items \nlike clothes and plastic reduce pollution and waste. Small actions \nlike saving energy and water add up. Learning more, sharing \nideas, and encouraging others also makes a difference.\nIn conclusion, sustaining life on Earth needs action from all \nof us — from local communities to global leaders. By working \ntogether and living responsibly, we can protect this unique \nplanet and its future.\nSnapshots\n\t\n\nOur Earth is a unique planet in the solar system as it supports life. \n\t\n\nEarth orbits the Sun at a distance where the temperature is \nneither too hot nor too cold, which allows water to exist in liquid \nform.

For a long time, many tiny things around us remained \nunknown. Long ago, people discovered that a curved piece of \nglass could make small things look bigger. The piece of glass \nwas shaped like a lentil seed — thick in the middle and thin at \nthe edge — hence they called it a lens. Over time, lenses were \nimproved to become more powerful. Each new tool, from simple \nmagnifying glasses to microscopes, helped humans see what \ntheir eyes could not. The invention of the microscope opened \na fascinating hidden world filled with tiny living creatures. We \nwill explore some of these life forms in this chapter.\nYou have already learnt about the amazing variety of living \nbeings. Just look around — there are so many beautiful plants \nand animals! They are of all shapes, sizes, and colours. Some \nliving beings are tiny, while others are really big. They differ not \nonly in their structure but also in many other features. All these \nliving beings, whether plants or animals, are called organisms. \nHave you ever noticed the smallest organism around you that is \nvisible to the naked eye? Think about it — how small a thing can \nyour eyes actually see? \nYou might have seen some people using reading glasses. How \ndoes it help them see better? Or what happens when we use a \nmagnifying glass to observe something?\nActivity 2.1: Let us observe\n\t\nz Take a round-bottom flask made up of glass as shown in \nFig. 2.1.

He \nwas a careful observer, and a skilled artist. \nIn this book, he showed detailed drawings \nof tiny things that people had never seen \nbefore — things he saw using a tool we now \ncall a microscope.\nHis microscope made things look 200 \nto 300 times bigger, than what one could \nsee with the unaided eye. One day, he \nlooked at a thin slice of cork and saw it \nwas made of many small, empty spaces. \nThese compartments reminded him of a \nhoneycomb. He drew what he saw and \ncalled each small space a cell. This was the \nfirst time the word cell was used in science \nto describe the basic unit of life.\nAround the same time in 1660s, Antonie \nvan Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist, made \nbetter lenses that allowed him to build more \nuseful microscopes. He was the first person \nto clearly see and describe tiny living things \nlike bacteria and blood cells.  Because of this, \nhe is known as the Father of Microbiology.\nFig. 2.2: (a) Micrographia book; (b) Microscope of Robert Hooke; \n(c) Cork cells as published in the Micrographia\nMICROGRAPHIA:\nOR SOME\nPhysiological Descriptions\nOF\nMINUTE BODIES\nMADE BY\nMAGNIFYING GLASSES.\nWITH\nOBSERVATIONS and INQUIRIES thereupon.\nBy R.

You will observe a polygon-\nshaped structure as shown in Fig. 2.4. These are cheek \ncells, which form the inner lining of your mouth.\nWhat similarities and differences did you observe \nbetween the cells of onion peel in Activity 2.2 and \nhuman cheek cells in Activity 2.3? \nYou have observed that cells have three main parts  \n— a thin outer lining, a central region, and a small \nround structure inside it. The outer layer is called the \ncell membrane. The round structure in the middle is \nthe nucleus, which is also covered by a thin membrane. The space \nbetween the cell membrane and nucleus is filled with cytoplasm. \nThese three — cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus — are the \nbasic parts of a cell. Some cells, like onion peel cells, have an \nextra outer layer called the cell wall. What is the importance of \nthese structures in a cell? What functions do they perform? Are \nthese functions important for the maintenance of life?\nThe cell membrane encloses the cytoplasm and nucleus. The \ncell membrane separates one cell from another. It is porous and \nallows the entry of materials essential for life processes and the \nexit of waste material.\nCytoplasm contains other components of the cell and \ncompounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and mineral \nsalts. Most of the life processes take place within the cytoplasm.\nFig. 2.4: Mount of human cheek cells\nNucleus\nCytoplasm\nCell membrane\nChapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye\nThe nucleus regulates all activities that occur within the cell. \nIt also regulates growth.\nThe cell wall in the plant cell provides rigidity and strength \nto plants. This is why all cells are arranged compactly with each \nother and look firm in structure.\nA step further\nCells in all parts of a plant have tiny rod-shaped structures called \nplastids. Some plastids, like chloroplasts, contain chlorophyll, which \nmakes them green and helps in photosynthesis. In non-green parts, \nthey help in the storage of substances. Plant cells also have a large, \nempty-looking space called a vacuole. This helps the plant cell store \nimportant substances, get rid of waste, and maintain the shape of \nthe cell. This gives strength and support to the plant. In animal cells, \nvacuoles are usually not present, if present, they are usually small. \nThese small vacuoles store certain substances dissolved in water \n(Fig. 2.5). So, a cell is not just a simple bag of liquid — it is a complex \nstructure made up of many different parts, each with its own special \nfunction to allow the cell, and in turn the entire organism to work.\n(a)\n(b)\nNucleus\nCell wall\nCell membrane\nCytoplasm\nVacuole\nChloroplast\nMitochondria\nFig. 2.5: A schematic drawing of (a) An animal cell and (b) A plant cell. \n(The colours are to show different parts of the cell)\nWe have now understood the basic structure of cell. And we \nnow also understand that plant and animal cells differ in shape and \nstructure.\nDo different animal cells also vary in their shape and structure?\n2.1.1 Variation in shape and structure of cells\nThe muscle cell and the nerve cell of a human are shown in Fig. 2.6a \nand (b). What are the similarities and differences you see in them?\nA muscle cell (Fig. 2.6a) is shaped like a spindle, while a nerve \ncell (Fig. 2.6b) is very long and has branches. Similarly, some cells \nare round in shape, while others are long and thin. The number \nof cells also varies in different organisms. Why do cells look so \ndifferent from each other? Does the shape and structure of a cell \nrelate to its function? \n(a) Muscle cell\n(b) Nerve cell\nFig. 2.6: Different cells \nin humans\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nThe unique shape, size, and structure of cells help them \ncarry out their specific functions. But how do these cells help in \nperforming various functions in the body? Let us find out.\nYou observed in Activity 2.3 that inner cheek cells are thin \nand flat. They form a protective lining on the inner surface of the \ncheek. Nerve cells also known as neurons carry messages in our \nbody. The elongated shape and branched structure help them \nreach different parts of the body and pass on messages quickly. \nSimilarly, plant cells also show variation. In plants, too, cells may \nbe rectangular, elongated, oval, or even tube-like. Some plant \ncells form long tubes that help carry water throughout the plant.\nYou have already studied the digestive system in Grade 7. Different \nparts of the digestive system are made up of different types of cells. \nA group of muscle cells are present in the food pipe. These cells \ncontract and relax in a wave-like manner, pushing the food down \nto the stomach. This movement is possible because muscle cells are \nthin, flexible, and spindle-shaped. The stomach also has different \ntypes of cells for performing different functions. Muscle cells in the \nstomach wall help churn the food. Other cells in the inner lining of \nthe stomach produce digestive juices and acid that help break down \nthe food. All these cells work together to make digestion possible.\n2.2 What Are the Levels of Organisation in \nthe Body of a Living Organism?\nThe body of a living organism is organised in a complex way. Cell \n(Fig. 2.7a), is the basic unit of life, just like a brick is the basic unit of wall \n(Fig. 2.3d). A group of similar cells forms a type of tissue (Fig. 2.7b). \nDifferent tissues are organised to form an organ (Fig. 2.7c). Several \norgans work together to form an organ system that performs a \nmajor function of the body (Fig. 2.7d). All the organ systems together \nmake up a complete organism (Fig. 2.7e) — like a plant or an animal.\nSo, the levels of organisations are:\nCell \n Tissue \n Organ \n Organ system \n Organism\nThese levels of organisation help us understand how simple \nbuilding blocks like cells come together to form a complex \nliving being.\nThe life of complex living organisms begins with a single cell— \n‘egg’. The egg of any organism has an amazing ability to divide \nrepeatedly to form a complete living being made up of many cells. \nSuch living beings are called multicellular organisms. Animals, \nincluding humans, and plants are all examples of multicellular \norganisms.\n(d) Organ \nsystem\n(a) Cell\n(b) Tissue\n(e) Organism\nFig. 2.7: Levels of \norganisation of life\n (c) Organ \nChapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye\nEver heard of ...\nThe yolk (the yellow part of an egg) of an \nostrich egg is a single cell — the largest \nknown \ncell \nin \nthe \nliving \nworld — measuring about 130 \nmm to 170 mm in diameter. The \negg contains extra non-cellular \nmaterial: a shell for protection and a white liquid that \nnourishes the cell during its continued development.\n2.3 What Are Microorganisms?\nSome living organisms are made up of just one or very few cells. \nThey are so small that they can not be seen with the naked eye. \nThese are called microorganisms. Some microorganisms, like \nbacteria and Amoeba, are made of just one cell (unicellular). Others, \nlike some fungi and algae, have many cells (multicellular). They \nare found all around us — in water, soil, air, and even inside our \nbody! But what do their cells look like? Are they like the plant and \nanimal cells we just learnt about, or are they different? To observe \nthe cells of a microorganism, again, we need to use a microscope \nwhich magnifies their size and makes them visible to us. Scientists \nhave also created a low-cost and foldable paper microscope or \nfoldscope. Foldscopes may not provide the same level of details \nlike high-powered laboratory microscopes. However, these make \nmicroscopic world accessible to many people.\nLet us now take a closer look at the fascinating world of microbes.\nActivity 2.4: Let us observe pond water/\nstagnant water\n\t\nz Take a container and collect pond or stagnant water in it \nwith the help of your teacher or elder(s).\n\t\nz Use a dropper and place a drop of pond or stagnant water on \na microscope or foldscope slide. Put a coverslip and observe \nit under the microscope or foldscope.\n\t\nz Observe the tiny organisms found in the pond or stagnant \nwater.\nActivity 2.5: Let us observe soil suspension\n\t\nz Take a beaker and collect some moist soil in it from the \nnearby field or garden. Do not touch the soil with your bare \nhands — use a spoon or gloves.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n\t\nz Pour some water into the beaker and stir it with a glass rod. \nThe liquid, which may look dirty, has very fine particles of \nsoil, and is called soil suspension. Keep it aside for some time \nand let the mixture settle.\n\t\nz Use a dropper and take a drop of water from the top layer. \nPlace the drop on a microscope slide.\n\t\nz Cover it gently with a coverslip and observe it under the \nmicroscope (Fig. 2.8).\nYou may observe small moving organisms similar to those you saw \nin Activity 2.4. This indicates that even soil suspension contains a \nvariety of tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the unaided eye.\nThe tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the naked eye are called \nmicroorganisms (micro means very small; organisms means living \nbeings) or microbes.\nActivity 2.6: Let us study\nA group of students studying in Grade 8 performed Activities 2.4 \nand 2.5. They also collected information from the library and \ninternet. They recorded the data obtained after observing pond \nwater in Table 2.1 and the data obtained after observing soil \nsuspension in Table 2.2. They identified the microorganisms as \nprotozoa, algae, fungi, and bacteria. You can record if you find \nany of these categories of organisms.\nTable 2.1: Organisms present in pond water\nS.No.\nDiagram\nRemarks\n1.\nAmoeba\n(Protozoa)\nSingle cell, moving, irregular shape\n2.\nParamecium\n(Protozoa)\nSingle cell, moves from one place to \nanother, movement takes place with \nthe help of specialised structures\n3.\nAlgae\nSingle cell, looks green because of the \npresence of green pigment, movement \ntakes place with the help of specialised \nstructures\nFig. 2.8: Observation \nof soil suspension \nunder the microscope\nChapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye\nTable 2.2: Organisms present in soil suspension\nS.No.\nDiagram\nRemarks\n1.\nBread mould \n(Fungi) \nBranched filament without chlorophyll having  \nsac-like structure\n2.\nMould (Fungi)\nBranched filament without chlorophyll having \nbrush-like structure\n3.\nAlgae\nSpherical, presence of chlorophyll — a green \npigment\n4.\nBacteria\nSpherical, comma, spiral or rod-shaped, one \nlong hair-like structure and many small  \nhair-like projections around the cell\nDid you also observe any of these microorganisms or \nsomething different? Record in your notebook and discuss in \nyour class. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you have identified a variety \nof microorganisms. They are everywhere, and we can only see \nthem with a microscope — a device that magnifies them 100 to \n400 times. Though microorganisms are small in size, they play an \nimportant role in our lives.\nEver heard of ...\nViruses are microscopic and acellular. Viruses \nmultiply when they enter a living cell. They may \ninfect plants, animals, or bacterial cells and may \ncause  a disease.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n2.4 How Are We Connected to Microbes?\nCan we find microorganisms in other places, too? \nLet us have a discussion:\nHave you ever seen a lemon, tomato, orange, or any \nother food item rot after being left outside for some \ntime? If yes, you may have noticed a powdery or \ncotton-like growth on them (Fig. 2.9). This happens \nbecause they have been infected by microbes. But \nwhere did these microbes come from? How did they \ncome in contact with the food?\nThis happens because microorganisms can be found \neverywhere, be it in water, soil, air, or even in some food items. \nYou can use a foldscope \nor a microscope to explore \nsurfaces of leaves, stems, \nroots, or any other part to \nsee them. Like plants and \nanimals, microorganisms \nalso show great diversity. \nSome of them can even be \nfound in extreme climatic \nconditions, such as hot \nwater springs and snow \ncold zones as well as at moderate temperatures. You already know \nsome of these organisms live inside our bodies, especially in our \ngut! You have studied in the chapter ‘Life Processes in Animals’ in \nCuriosity, Grade 7 that our intestine has many bacteria that help in \ndigestion. Like plants and animals, microorganisms vary in shape, \nsize, and structure. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you would have observed \nmicroorganisms of different shapes — spherical, rod-shape, or \nirregular.\nHow does the diversity of microorganisms play a role in our \ndaily life? How do they help clean the environment?\n2.4.1 Key players in cleaning the environment\nLet us attempt to understand this by doing an activity.\nActivity 2.7: Let us do\n\t\nz Take an empty container and fill it halfway with garden soil.\n\t\nz Add some fruit and vegetable peels to the container. \nThereafter, put a layer of soil on it and leave it aside.\nThis is because you add many spices \nwith salt or sugar to it which act as \npreservatives. High concentration \nof salt or sugar do not allow these \norganisms to grow on them.\nBut why do microorganisms \nnot infect the pickles and \nmurabbas?\nFig. 2.9: Fruit with microorganism \ngrowing on it\nChapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye\n\t\nz After 2–3 weeks, observe the changes \nthat have taken place.\n\t\nz Do you observe any difference in the \ncontents of the container?\nYou may find that peels of fruits and \nvegetables have turned into a dark-coloured \nmaterial. This is manure, which is rich in \nnutrients and helps increase the fertility of \nthe soil. But how did the peels of fruits and \nvegetables turn into manure?\nIn Activity 2.6, you saw that soil contains \nvarious kinds of microorganisms. Some of \nthese microorganisms, like fungi and bacteria, \nact on the plant waste and slowly break it down into simpler, \nnutrient-rich manure. You may have seen gardeners in your \nschool or in a field near your house collecting dry leaves and \nplant waste and putting them into pits. Do you now understand \nwhy they do this? It is to make natural manure.\nAncient Indian texts, particularly the Vedas, have references of \nthe word ‘Krimi’ which means different tiny entities including \n‘Drishya’ (visible) and ‘Adrishya’ (invisible). Various Vedic texts \nmention their beneficial and harmful effects. \nAtharvaveda also refers to ‘Krimi’. \nOur scientific heritage\nIf you look around carefully, you might see decaying plants \nand fallen leaves stored in a container or lying in the garden, \ndisappear after some time from the surroundings. This is \nbecause microorganisms breakdown and turn them into simpler \nsubstances rich in nutrients. These nutrients go back to the soil \nand help plants grow better. Microorganisms also decompose \nbodies of dead animals. So, microbes help recycle the waste and \nreturn important nutrients to nature. Manure formation occurs \nat optimal temperature and appropriate moisture level.\nIsn’t it interesting? By now, you must have understood that \nbacteria and some fungi are types of microorganisms that play \nan important role in our lives. And guess what, these helpful \nbacteria can also decompose animal wastes like dung!\nFrom Activity 2.7, we can also infer that microorganisms not \nonly help in plant growth, but also clean our environment by \nbreaking down waste.\nFig. 2.10: Recycling of nutrients by making \nmanure\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nNow, think what would have happened if microorganisms did \nnot exist on Earth?\nA step further\nMicrobes as a source of biogas\nMany microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, live in an oxygen-\nfree environment. Some of these bacteria have the ability to \ndecompose plant and animal waste present in the environment or \nhousehold wastewater. During the process, they release a mixture \nof gases containing carbon dioxide, and a high proportion of \nanother gas, methane. This gas has been used as a fuel source for \ncooking, heating, generating electricity, and to even run vehicles.\nBe a scientist\nDr. Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty (1938–2020) was a \nscientist who studied bacteria. In 1971, he developed \na special bacterium that could break down oil spills, \nhelping to clean the environment. His discovery \nreceived a patent in 1980. Patent is a copyright \ngiven to a person so that no one else can copy, use \nor sell his/her invention without permission. His \nwork showed how microorganisms could be used \nto solve environmental problems like pollution.  He \nis remembered for his contributions to science and for protecting the \nenvironment using microbes. What are the other  problems which you \nthink can be solved with the help of microorganisms? \nHow does the diversity of microorganisms help in our kitchen?\n2.4.2 Microorganisms and food\nLet us try to understand by performing activities in the kitchen.\nActivity 2.8: Let us perform\n\t\nz Take two bowls A and B.\n\t\nz In each, take 200 g of flour (atta or maida) and add a pinch \nof sugar.\n\t\nz Now, in bowl A, add a small amount of yeast powder and mix \nit well with the flour.\n\t\nz In bowl B, do not add any yeast, so that we can compare the \nresults of the two bowls.\n\t\nz Knead the flour of the two bowls with warm water to make \nsoft dough (Fig. 2.11).\n (a) Dough in bowl A\n(b) Dough in bowl B\nFig. 2.11: Change in the \nvolume of flour after \naddition of yeast, sugar, and \nwarm water\nChapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye\n\t\nz Cover the dough with a damp cloth and keep it in a warm place.\n\t\nz Observe both the bowls after 4–5 hours.\nDid you find any change in the volume, smell, or texture of the \ndough? If not, leave the dough for some more time. After some time, \nyou may notice that the dough in bowl A, where yeast was added, has \nrisen slightly, become fluffy, and has a different smell compared to \nthe dough kneaded without yeast. Why does this happen? What is the \nrole of yeast? Why did we add sugar and warm water to the flour?\nYeast is a type of microorganism. It belongs to a group \nof microorganisms, called fungi. Yeast grows well in warm \nconditions. You may recall from chapter ‘Life Process in Animals’ \nin Grade 7 that, like other organisms, yeast also respires and breaks \ndown food to release energy for their growth and carry out life \nprocesses. During this process, carbon dioxide is released, which \nforms bubbles that makes the dough soft and fluffy. Yeast also \nproduces a small amount of alcohol during this process, which \ngives the dough a slightly different smell. This special property of \nyeast is used in the process of making breads, cakes, and more! \nIn addition to yeast, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, help in \nfermentation of batter for making idli and dosa, and dough for \nmaking bhatura.\nActivity 2.9: Let us prepare\n\t\nz Take two small glass bowls — label them ‘A’ and ‘B’.\n\t\nz Pour lukewarm milk in bowl A, and cold milk in bowl B.\n\t\nz Now, add a small spoonful of curd to each bowl and mix well \nusing a spoon.\n\t\nz Cover both bowls. Keep bowl A in a warm place and bowl B in \na cool place (like a refrigerator) for a few hours or overnight.\n\t\nz Observe the changes in the glass bowls. Write your predictions \nand observations in Table 2.4.\nTable 2.4: Testing for curd formation using milk in \ndifferent conditions\nChange in the \nappearance of milk\nChange in the \ncolour of milk\nPossible \nreason\nBowl A\nBowl B\nBowl A\nBowl B\nPrediction\nObservation\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nYou will observe that in bowl \nA, the milk has turned into curd \nafter a few hours and has become \nlittle sour. Whereas in bowl B, the \nmilk has not curdled, but it might \nbe a little sour. Do you know why \nthis happens? The curd contains \nseveral types of bacteria. One \nof them is Lactobacillus. This \nbacterium feeds on the sugar in \nthe milk (lactose), multiplies, and \nferments the milk to form curd. \nInstead of producing alcohol (like \nyeast), these bacteria produce \nlactic acid, which makes curd \nsour. These bacteria grow well in warm conditions. That is why \ncurd is formed in bowl A but not in bowl B.\nWe can categorise the microorganisms into different \ncategories, such as protozoa, fungi, bacteria, some algae, and \nmore. Some bacteria, such as Rhizobium, form the swollen \nregions called nodules and live in them as shown in Fig. 2.12. \nRoots of certain legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils have \nroot nodules that contain Rhizobium bacteria. These bacteria \ntrap nitrogen from the air and make it useful for the plants. \nThis helps plants grow better without chemical fertilisers. \nThat is why farmers grow legumes in rotation with other crops. \nThis  naturally increases the nitrogen in the soil and keeps it \nhealthy for the next crop.\n2.4.3 Amazing microalgae: tiny helpers in water \nMicroalgae are microscopic plant-like organisms that live in \nwater, soil, air, and even on trees. They make their own food using \nsunlight.  While doing this, they also release oxygen and produce \nmore than half of the Earth’s oxygen supply. They are rich in \nnutrients and serve as a food source for many aquatic animals. \nSome, like Spirulina, Chlorella, and Diatoms, are also used by \nhumans as health supplements and medicines. Microalgae also \nhelp in cleaning water and are used to make biofuel.\nHowever, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction are \nthreatening microalgal diversity and abundance. It is important \nto conserve these tiny organisms to protect the environment and \nmaintain oxygen balance on Earth.\nFig. 2.12: Root nodules of Cowpea \nplant which contain Rhizobium\nChapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye\nEver heard of ...\nSpirulina, a microalga, is called a superfood \nbecause of its health benefits. Spirulina is \nalso a good source of vitamin B12, which is \nessential for our body. It has a lot of protein—\nmore than 60 per cent of its body weight—and \nonly a small amount of fat and sugar.  \nNowadays, farming of Spirulina is becoming a feasible livelihood \nopportunity. You can grow Spirulina easily by following these steps:\n1.\t \u0007Set a clear glass tank in a bright place away from direct sunlight.\n2.\t \u0007Cover the tank with a shade net, or keep the tank at a place with \nmoderate temperature conditions.\n3.\t \u0007Fill the tank with pond water.\n4.\t \u0007Add living Spirulina collected from a \npond.\n5.\t \u0007Stir the growing Spirulina twice a week.\n6.\t \u0007After 3–6 weeks, Spirulina may be \nharvested from the tank by filtering it \nthrough a fine cloth.\nConservation of microalgae is a good practice for ensuring food \nsecurity and livelihood development.\n2.5 \u0007Why Is Cell Considered to Be a Basic Unit \nof Life?\nThe body of all living organisms are made up of tiny building \nblocks called cells. A single cell contains various components \nthat help organisms perform various functions. The bodies of all \nplants and animals are made up of many cells. Therefore, they are \ncalled multicellular (many-celled) organisms. In multicellular \norganisms, cells carry out specialised functions individually but \nalso cooperate with each other to increase the chance of survival.\nSome microorganisms, such as bacteria \nand protozoa, are made up of just one cell. \nThese are called unicellular (single-celled) \norganisms. They carry out all the functions \nnecessary for their survival in a single cell. \nOther microbes, like algae and fungi, are \nmade up of one or more cells. For example, \nyeast is a unicellular fungus while mould is \na multicellular fungus.\nNucleoid\nFig. 2.13: A bacterial cell showing the \nnucleoid region\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nLike animal and plant cells, the cells of microorganisms are \nalso surrounded by a cell membrane. Cells of fungi additionally \nhave a cell wall, but they do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot \nmake their own food through photosynthesis. Bacteria do not \nhave a well-defined nucleus and a nuclear membrane. Instead \nthey have a nucleoid. This feature distinguishes them from cells \nof yeast, protozoa, algae, fungi, plants, and animals.\nWe have only looked at a few basic cell structures here. The cell \nhas other components about which you will learn in higher classes.\nFor observing subcellular components, we need microscopes \nwith  high magnification. An electron microscope magnifies the \ncell about 10,00,000 times, where we can see more structures \npresent in a cell.\nBy now, you must have understood that all living beings, \nincluding microorganisms, are made up of one or more cells. \nTheir cells differ in size, shape, and structure. Plant and animal \ncells also have some differences. Understanding these differences \nhelps us learn how these organisms function differently.\nIn this chapter, we have learnt about the beneficial \nmicroorganisms. However, there are some microbes that cause \ndiseases in plants and animals including humans. We will learn \nabout some of the diseases caused by microbes in the next chapter.\nSnapshots  \n\t\n\nMicroorganisms are small-sized organisms and are not visible to the \nunaided eye.\n\t\n\nThey can live in all kinds of environments, and even in the bodies of \nplants and animals.\n\t\n\nThey are either unicellular or multicellular.

Can you think of the reasons?\n4.\t Snehal dug two pits, A and B, in her garden.

Is being healthy just about not \nhaving diseases? Health also includes feeling good physically, \nstaying positive, and having strong relationships. A healthy person \ntakes care of their body, maintains a positive mindset, and enjoys \nsocial life. Let us now explore what it truly means to be healthy.\nActivity 3.1:  Let us read\nA Grade 8 student moved to a new school in another city. With no \nfriends in his new environment and busy parents, he felt lonely. To \ncope, he spent more time on his phone and social media, but this made \nhim feel worse. He stopped trying to make friends, had headaches, \nlost weight, and could not sleep well. A doctor advised less screen \ntime and meeting a counsellor. The school counsellor arranged help \nto support him in making friends and improving his health.\nThink and Reflect: What was the cause of the boy’s health problems? \nHow did his habits and surroundings affect his well-being?\nAs per the World Health Organization (WHO), health is \ndefined as a ‘state of complete physical, mental, and social \nwell-being, and not merely the absence of disease’ (Fig. 3.1). A \nhealthy person can perform various tasks more efficiently and \ncope well in different and difficult situations. A healthy person \ncan adjust well with peer groups and other members of society. \nLet us understand more about health.\nAyurveda teaches us that true health is a balance of body, mind, and \nsurroundings.\nFollowing \ndinacharya \n(daily \nroutine) \nand \nritucharya (seasonal routine) helps maintain this \nbalance. Eating fresh, wholesome food suited to \none’s prakriti (body constitution) is essential. \nRegular exercise, cleanliness, restful sleep, and \na calm mind support overall well-being. This \ncan also be achieved through practices like yoga, \nmeditation, and mindfulness.\nOur scientific heritage\n3.2 How Can We Stay Healthy?\nStaying healthy means eating nutritious food, maintaining \nhygiene, staying in a clean place, exercising regularly, getting \nFig. 3.1: Aspects of \nhealth\nMental\nPhysical\nSocial\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nproper sleep, spending time with family and friends, and having \na positive attitude. What we should do and what should not do to \nkeep ourselves healthy?\nActivity 3.2:  Let us list\n\t\nz List some good habits that your parents, teachers, or elders \noften encourage you to follow. How many of these are already \na part of your daily routine? Which ones would you like to \nstart following? Add to the list below:\n\t\n{\nKeep yourself clean and maintain personal hygiene.\n\t\n{\nEat a healthy and balanced diet.\n\t\n{\nExercise regularly.\n\t\n{\nMake time to relax or meditate every day.\n\t\nz Now, think about habits that are not good for your health. \nAdd more to the list below:\n\t\n{\nSpending too much time on mobile phones or other digital \nscreens.\n\t\n{\nEating fast food and other junk food every day.\n\t\n{\nSleeping very late or not getting enough sleep.\n\t\n{\nSkipping meals, especially breakfast.\nTaking care of our body and mind is important. Healthy habits \nsupport a healthy body as well as a healthy mind. \nDiscuss your findings with your friends and teacher. From \nthe activity you participated in and the discussions, you may \nhave realised that our health depends on many factors. These \nfactors include our lifestyle (how we live) and our environment \n(our surroundings).\n3.2.1 Maintain a healthy lifestyle\n\t\nz Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and \nwhole grains.\n\t\nz Avoid processed, fatty, or sugary food and drinks.\n\t\nz Stay physically active by playing outdoors, walking, running, \ncycling, or exercising.\n\t\nz Limit screen time and spend more time in nature.  \n\t\nz Get enough sleep to help your body and mind rest and recover.\n\t\nz Practice yoga or simple breathing exercises like pranayama \nregularly.\n\t\nz Say ‘NO’ to harmful substances things like tobacco, alcohol, \nand addictive drugs (Fig. 3.2).\nEat a balanced diet\nStay physically active\nSay no to smoking or \nalcohol\nManage stress\nGet enough sleep\nFig. 3.2: How to be healthy\nChapter 3 — Health: The Ultimate Treasure\n3.2.2 Keep the environment clean\nActivity 3.3: Let us compare\n\t\nz Look at Fig. 3.3a and Fig. 3.3b.  Which playground would you \nlike to play in, and why?  \n\t\nz Most of us would like to play in the \nplayground shown in Fig. 3.3a as it is clean, \nwell-maintained, and looks beautiful. The \nplayground in Fig. 3.3b is polluted, dirty, \nunhygienic, and full of flies and mosquitoes. \nPeople living in such areas may fall sick \nmore often. \n\t\nz In addition to inculcating good habits and \nadopting a healthy lifestyle, we must keep \nourselves and our surroundings clean.  \n\t\nz Have you ever found it hard to breathe in \na place with a lot of smoke or dust? That is \nbecause clean air and water are important \nfor our health. In cities, air pollution from \nvehicles and factories can cause problems \nlike coughing or asthma. The Air Quality \nIndex (AQI) helps us know how clean the \nair is. A cleaner environment helps us stay \nhealthy and feel better.\n\t\nz But health is not only about the body. \nOur feelings and relationships matter too. \nEven if we eat well and live in a clean place, \nwe may not feel good if we are lonely or upset. Spending \ntime with friends and family, talking, laughing, and having \nfun help keep our minds healthy too.\n3.3 How Do We Know That We Are Unwell?\nOur body usually works in a certain way to keep us healthy. \nWhen we feel unwell, it means something inside us may not \nbe working as it should. We may have symptoms, such as pain, \ntiredness, or dizziness, and signs like fever, rash, high blood \npressure, or swelling that indicate we are unwell. A symptom \nis what we feel (like pain), while a sign is something that can be \nseen or measured (like high body temperature when we have \nfever). These help doctors understand what might be making us \nunwell.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 3.3: Two different playgrounds \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n3.4 Diseases: What Are the Causes and Types?\nA disease is a condition that affects the normal working of the \nbody or mind. It can happen when one or more organs or organ \nsystems stop functioning properly. Some diseases are caused by \ngerms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, worms, or even by protozoa \n(single-celled organisms). These disease-causing organisms are \ncalled pathogens. Other diseases may result from poor nutrition \nor an unhealthy lifestyle. Some diseases last for a short time, while \nothers can continue for a long time and need regular treatment \nor care. Diseases can be grouped into two major types based on \ntheir causes and how they spread:\n\t\nz Non-communicable \ndiseases— Some diseases, like \ncancer, diabetes, or asthma, \nare not caused by pathogens \nand do not spread from one \nperson to another. They are \nusually linked to lifestyle, diet, \nand/or environment.\n\t\nz Communicable diseases— \nDiseases caused by pathogens \nare called communicable \ndiseases. They can spread \nfrom one person to \nanother. Some examples \nof communicable diseases \nare typhoid, dengue, flu, \nchickenpox, and COVID-19. \nIn recent years, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like \ndiabetes, heart disease, and cancer have become more common \nin India. This is happening because of changes in how people \nlive — such as eating more processed food, getting less exercise, \nand living longer lives. Today, most deaths in India are caused \nby NCDs. Understanding the difference between these two types \nhelps us know how diseases spread and how to prevent them.\n3.4.1 How are communicable diseases caused and spread?\nAll communicable diseases are caused by pathogens. These \npathogens can enter our body through the air we breathe or by \nconsuming contaminated food or water and more. But how do \nthese pathogens spread from one person to another? One common \nway is through air, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or \nthrough direct contact like shaking hands, or indirectly by sharing \nFig. 3.4: Common methods of transmission of diseases\nInfected \nperson\nHealthy\nperson\nMosquito insects\nBy food\nDirect contact\nIndirect \ncontact\nBy air\nHealthy person\nRabid animal\nChapter 3 — Health: The Ultimate Treasure\npersonal items of an infected person. Some of the communicable \ndiseases spread through contaminated drinking water or food. \nSome pathogens are also spread by insects like mosquitoes and \nhouseflies — these insects are called vectors (Fig. 3.4).\nBy understanding how diseases spread, we can take simple \nsteps to protect ourselves and others. Let us find out how these \ncommunicable diseases spread and how we can prevent them.\nActivity 3.4: Let us find out\n\t\nz Grade 8 students listed some common communicable \ndiseases in Table 3.1 during a community campaign and a \nlibrary survey.\n\t\nz Check the information listed by referring to books, trusted \nwebsites, or asking your science teacher.

Here are some simple \nbut important precautions:\n\t\nz Keeping ourselves and our surroundings clean.\n\t\nz Practising basic hygiene every day.\n\t\nz Washing hands with soap and water to remove pathogens. \n\t\nz Covering our mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing.\n\t\nz Wearing a mask in crowded places provides protection.\n\t\nz Avoid sharing of personal items like towels \nand handkerchiefs.\n\t\nz Keeping our home, food, and water clean.\n\t\nz Staying at home and resting when we are unwell helps the \nbody recover and minimises spreading the disease to others.\nSome infectious diseases are caused by worms that live inside \nour bodies, especially in the digestive system. They feed on nutrients \nand live as parasites — organisms that live in or on another living \nbeing. These worms usually spread through contaminated food, \nwater, soil, or contact with infected people or animals.\n3.4.2 How are non-communicable diseases caused? \nYou learnt that non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, \nand asthma are linked to lifestyle, diet, and/or environment. \nThey are the most common cause of death in India. In Grade 6, \nyou also learnt about diseases like scurvy, anaemia, and goitre, \nAre diseases always \ncaused by infections?\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nwhich are caused by a lack of specific nutrients \nin the diet. These are called deficiency diseases \nand are also non-communicable.\nDiseases such as cancer, diabetes, and asthma may often persist \nfor a long time (more than 3 months) and are referred to as \nchronic diseases. \nDiabetes is a common disease which is becoming more \nprevalent in adults as well as children. In fact, India now has \none of the highest numbers of people with diabetes in the world. \nIt often develops due to a combination of hormonal imbalances, \nunhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity,  being overweight \nor obese, and other reasons.\nLet us learn more about the causes of non-communicable \ndiseases and their prevention.\nActivity 3.5: Let us survey\n\t\nz Find out the three most common lifestyle-related diseases in \nyour neighbourhood\n\t\nz Talk to a doctor, nurse, health worker or even a family \nmember who knows about health and what kind of lifestyle \nchanges can help prevent or manage these diseases.\n\t\nz You can also consult trusted health websites, books, teachers \nand doctors.\n\t\nz Fill in Table 3.2 and learn more about lifestyle-related diseases.\nS.

She studied how hormones \nand certain viruses are linked to cancer, helping \nimprove its treatment and prevention. Her work \nalso showed how tobacco, diet, and pollution can \nraise the risk of cancer, highlighting the importance \nof a healthy lifestyle.\n3.5 How to Prevent and Control Diseases?\nYou might have heard the phrase ‘Prevention is better than cure.’ \nIt is important to protect ourselves from both communicable and \nnon-communicable diseases.\nActivity 3.6: Let us read\nOdisha — community-led sanitation campaign\nIn Bhadrak district, Odisha, a community sanitation campaign \nhelped more people build and use toilets. This reduced open \ndefecation significantly, and improved child health, with fewer \ncases of diarrhoea and infections.\nWhat do you infer from this case study? Simple steps like good \nsanitation can greatly reduce the spread of communicable diseases. \nFind about such community campaigns held in your location. Share \nin your class and discuss with your peers about the impact of such \ninitiatives. \nAbility of the body to fight diseases \nYou would have noticed that some people get sick more frequently \nthan others, although living in a similar environment. Do you \nknow why? The natural ability of our body to fight diseases is \nknown as immunity. Our body has a special system called the \nimmune system that helps fight against diseases. \nYou might have taken some drops or injections in your \nchildhood to protect yourself from certain diseases, such as \npolio, measles, tetanus, and hepatitis. These are vaccines that \nhelp prevent serious infections caused by viruses and bacteria. \nA vaccine helps our body fight certain diseases by training \nthe immune system to recognise and attack harmful germs. \nproviding what is known as acquired immunity — protection \ndeveloped after exposure to a pathogen or a vaccine. Vaccines can \nbe made in different ways — from weakened or dead pathogens \n(like viruses or bacteria), or from inactive or harmless parts of \nthe pathogen. Some newer vaccines instruct our own body cells \nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nto make a harmless part of the germ, which our immune system \nthen learns to fight.\nFor example, a tetanus shot, often given after an injury \nprotects against infection by the tetanus-causing bacteria. \nIt contains an inactivated bacterial toxin that helps the immune \nsystem develop protection without causing the disease.\nDo you know when the first vaccine was discovered?\nEdward Jenner and the smallpox vaccine \nSmallpox was a deadly disease that caused blisters and killed \nmillions. A milder disease called cowpox, seen in cows, could also \ninfect humans. In the late 1700s, English doctor Edward Jenner \ndiscovered that people who had cowpox did not get smallpox. \nThis led to the invention of the first vaccine and helped protect \npeople from smallpox.\nOur scientific heritage\nLong before modern vaccines, India had a traditional method called \nvariolation to protect against smallpox. It involved using material \nfrom a smallpox sore to scratch the skin and create a mild infection \nand build immunity. People who performed this practice were known \nas teekedaars.\nThink like a scientist\nObservations\nJenner observed that milkmaids who had \ncowpox did not catch smallpox, likely because \nthe two viruses are related.\nResults\nHe found that people who were infected \nwith cowpox sap were now resistant to \nsmallpox.\n \nApplication\nMass vaccination eventually helped \neradicate smallpox worldwide.\nExperimentation\nHe tested this by injecting cowpox sap into a \nboy, who later showed no illness when exposed \nto smallpox.\nNumber of Countries Reporting Cases\nCountries reporting \nsmallpox (1950–1980) \n1965:  Vaccine \ncampaign \n1979: \nSmallpox \neradicated \nHypothesis\nContent in the pus of cowpox blisters protected people from smallpox.\nYear\nChapter 3 — Health: The Ultimate Treasure\nVaccines are one of the most effective ways to protect people \nof all ages — from infants to the elderly — against many serious \ndiseases. They help prevent illnesses, reduce the spread of \ninfections, and save millions of lives every year. It is important \nto remember that vaccines are preventive, not curative — they \ncan help minimise serious diseases before they happen, but do \nnot treat them once someone is already sick. Some people may \nfear or doubt vaccines, but scientists and doctors carefully test \nthem for safety. Getting vaccinated not only protects you but also \nthe people around you.\nEver heard of ...\nIndia’s Role in Vaccine Production\nIndia is one of the world’s largest vaccine \nproducers. It manufactures vaccines on a \nmassive scale and supplies them to many \ncountries. Indian vaccine companies \nplayed a key role during the COVID-19 \npandemic and continue to support global \nhealth efforts. \nBe a scientist\nDr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan was a well-known Indian \ndoctor and scientist. As Secretary of the Department \nof Biotechnology, he helped promote science and \ninnovation in India. He played a key role in developing \nthe Rotavirus vaccine, which protects children from \ndiarrhoea. He believed in using research to create \naffordable healthcare and made a big difference in \nIndia’s health and biotechnology sectors.\n3.5.1 Treatment of diseases\nIf our immune system fails to protect us against an infectious \ndisease, we fall ill and need to visit a doctor. The doctor may \ngive us medicines called antibiotics, which kill the bacteria that \nmight have caused the disease. Antibiotics work only against \nbacterial infections because they target parts of bacterial cells \nthat are different from human or other animal cells. They do not \nwork against viruses or diseases caused by protozoa.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nThink like a scientist\nDiscovery of the first antibiotic, Penicillin\nPenicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, \na bacteriologist from London. While studying harmful \nbacteria, he noticed that a mould on a discarded petri \ndish stopped the bacteria from growing. He realized \nthe mould released a substance that killed the bacteria. \nThis chance discovery led to the discovery of penicillin, \nthe first  antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.\nThough antibiotics are effective in protecting us against \nbacterial infections and have saved millions of lives since their \ndiscovery, their indiscriminate use has led to a decline in their \neffectiveness (Fig. 3.5a). Nowadays, there are news headlines \nabout antibiotic resistance, a phenomenon where bacteria that \nwere earlier killed by a given antibiotic are found to survive \nand multiply despite treatment with that antibiotic. This makes \nHOW ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE SPREADS IN THE COMMUNITY?\nFig. 3.5 (a): Spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in community\nExposure \nthrough animal \nfood products\nDevelopment of \nresistance in the \nbacteria in animals\nDevelopment of \nresistance in a human \nbody\nPatients go \nhome\nSpread in \nhospital \nthrough dirty \nsurface\nSpread \nresistant \nbacteria to \ncommunity\nMay have \nserious illness \nand gets care \nat a hospital\nTaking antibiotics when they are not required\nIt reaches human \ndigestive system through \ncrop produce\nHow resistant \nbacteria spread \nthrough plants and \nanimal products\nHow resistant \nbacteria spread \nthrough humans\nSpread through \nsoil in a crop field \nmanure/animal \nfaeces\nSpread \ndirectly to \nother patients \nor indirectly \nthrough \nhealthcare \nworkers\nAntibiotics\nChapter 3 — Health: The Ultimate Treasure\ncommon infections harder to treat and increases the risk of \ncomplications, prolonged illness, and even death.\nActivity 3.7: Let us infer\n\t\nz Study the infographic given in Fig. 3.5b. How do you think \nthe antibiotic resistance has been developed in bacterial \npathogens? What precautions may be taken to reduce \nantibiotic resistance?\n\t\nz To tackle the problem of antibiotic resistance, we must \nuse antibiotics wisely — only when prescribed by a doctor, \nin the correct dose, and for the right duration. Avoiding \nunnecessary use helps prevent the rise of resistant bacteria \nand keeps antibiotics effective for future generations.\nTraditional medicine systems like Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani \nhave been used in India for many years to manage common \nhealth problems. They use natural substances like herbs, oils, \nHOW BACTERIA BECAME RESISTANT TO ANITBIOTICS?\nI need antibiotic for my \nmother. She has a sore \nthroat and a fever.\nNo. I am not using any  \nantibiotics.\nIt will develop antibiotic \nresistance otherwise.\nYou must get a \nprescription from a \ndoctor.\nAre you giving antibiotics \nto your cattle?\nantibiotic\nNo...

While these \nsystems can help with some conditions, and are useful for \neveryday well-being, they may not be effective for all diseases \nand at all stages. \nTherapies for non-communicable diseases focus on managing \nsymptoms and improving quality of life through medication, \nlifestyle changes, and rehabilitation.

Mohini and Aakarsh, along with their \nfriends, went from one exhibit to another, eagerly exploring \ndifferent models, asking questions and taking notes. One simple \nmodel really fascinated them. It was a working model of a lifting \nelectromagnet which was displayed by their senior, Sumana. \nIn it, instead of a hook like a typical crane, there was an iron \nnail wrapped with a wire, which was connected to a battery. \nWhen Sumana closed the circuit, the nail picked up iron paper \nclips like a magnet. When she opened the circuit, the clips fell \noff. Mohini and Aakarsh, were surprised. They remembered \nlearning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’, Curiosity, \nGrade 6) that magnetic materials were attracted by magnet and \nthat iron was a magnetic material. But in Sumana’s model, there \nwas no magnet, only an electric circuit. They were so excited that \nthey wanted to try it out themselves.\n4.1 \u0007Does an Electric Current Have a Magnetic \nEffect? \nActivity 4.1: Let us investigate\n\t\nz Collect a magnetic compass, an electric cell, a cell holder, \ntwo drawing pins, a safety pin, two nails, two pieces of \nconnecting wires (one longer and one shorter), and two \nsmall pieces of cardboard. \n\t\nz Using two drawing pins, a safety pin, and a cardboard \npiece, make a switch (as you made it earlier in the \nchapter ‘Electricity: Circuits and their Components’ in \nCuriosity, Grade 7).\n\t\nz Place the cell in the cell holder. \n\t\nz Fix two nails to a piece of cardboard as shown in \nFig.  4.1a. Fix the middle portion of the longer wire \nstretched between the nails, such that it is slightly above \nthe surface of the cardboard. Attach one end of that \nwire to the cell holder and another end to the switch.\n\t\nz Connect the second wire between the cell holder and \nthe switch.\n\t\nz Place the magnetic compass beneath the wire between \nthe two nails (Fig. 4.1a). \nFig. 4.1: An electric circuit \nand a magnetic compass\n(b)\n(a)\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nWhile watching the compass needle, move the switch to \n‘ON’ position to allow electric current to flow through the wire \n(Fig. 4.1b). What do you observe? \n\t\nz Now again while watching the compass needle, move the \nswitch to ‘OFF’ position. What do you observe this time? \n\t\nz Move the switch between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ positions a few more \ntimes. Carefully observe how the compass needle behaves \nthe each time.\nYou may have noticed that when the current flows, the compass \nneedle gets deflected from its original direction. When the current \nstops, the needle returns to its original direction. \nAs we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ \nin Curiosity, Grade 6), the compass needle is a tiny magnet which \ndeflects when a magnet is brought near it and this magnetic effect \ncan act through any non-magnetic materials kept in between. \nBut why does the compass needle deflect when the current \nflows through the wire? The deflection indicates that the current \ncarrying wire has a magnetic effect on the compass needle. \nWhen the current stops, this magnetic effect disappears and \nthe compass needle returns to its original direction. The region \naround a magnet or a current carrying wire where its magnetic \neffect can be felt, such as by the deflection of a compass needle, \nis said to have a magnetic field.\nWhen \nelectric \ncurrent \nflows \nthrough a conductor (like a wire), it \nproduces a magnetic field around it. \nThis phenomenon is known as the \nmagnetic effect of electric current. \nThe magnetic field disappears when \nthe current stops flowing.\nBe a scientist \nYou have just now made the same discovery which \nwas made by the scientist Hans Christian Oersted \n(1777–1851) in 1820, that is, the discovery that \nelectricity and magnetism are linked. He was a \nprofessor at a university in Denmark. It is said that \nonce while giving a demonstration, he noticed that \nwhenever an electrical circuit was closed or \nopened, the needle of a magnetic compass, lying \nnearby, deflected. He investigated this and when he was certain that \nan electric current indeed produced a magnetic field, he published \nhis findings. This led to other scientists repeating his experiment to \ncheck if they got the same results, and further investigating the \nconnection between electricity and magnetism. \nWe have learnt about magnets \nand electric current in earlier \ngrades. I used to think that there \nwas no link between the two. But \nnow we found that electricity \nand magnetic effect are linked!\nChapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects\nThe magnetic effect of electric current \nhas many practical applications, such as \nin devices like electromagnets, electric \nbells, \nmotors, \nfans, \nloudspeakers, \nand more. \n4.1.1 Electromagnets\nActivity 4.2: Let us explore\n\t\nz Take around 50 cm long length of a flexible \ninsulated wire, an iron nail, an electric cell, and \nfew iron paper clips.\n\t\nz Tightly wrap the wire around the nail in the form \nof a coil, as shown in Fig. 4.2, and secure it with \nan adhesive tape.\n\t\nz Connect the ends of the wire to the cell. Take care \nto not connect the wires to the cell for more than \na few seconds; otherwise, the cell may weaken \nquickly. \n\t\nz Bring the nail close to the iron paper clips and \nlift up. Do the clips hang to the ends of the nail?\n\t\nz Disconnect the wire from the cell to stop the \nflow of electric current in the wire. Do the clips \nfall down?\nWhen electric current flows through the coil, the clips cling \nto it. But when the current is stopped, the clips no longer cling \nto it. Let us now try to investigate these observations in detail \nthrough Activity 4.3.\nActivity 4.3: Let us experiment\n\t\nz Take around 100 cm long flexible insulated wire, a piece \nof chart paper, an iron nail, an electric cell, two magnetic \ncompasses, and few iron/steel paper clips.\n\t\nz Roll a piece of chart paper to make a cylinder of diameter \nroughly equal to the width of a pencil. Secure it with an \nadhesive tape.\n\t\nz Tightly wind around 50 turns of the insulated wire on the \ncylinder to form a cylindrical coil as shown in Fig.  4.3a. \nSecure the wire with an adhesive tape.\nFig. 4.3: (a) A coil \nof insulated wire\nCan we use electric \ncurrent to make a \nmagnet?\nFig. 4.2: Coil of wire \nconnected with a cell\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nFig. 4.3: (b) Coil and magnetic compasses; \n(c) Coil connected to a cell; (d) Coil with \niron nail inserted; (e) Coil with iron nail \nand clips\n(d)\n(e)\n(c)\n(b)\n\t\nz Place the compasses near the two ends of the \ncylindrical coil (Fig. 4.3b).\n\t\nz Connect the two ends of the coil with the \nterminals of the cell as shown in Fig. 4.3c and \nobserve the magnetic compasses. Do you find \nany deflection in the needles of the compasses?\n\t\nz Disconnect the wire from the cell. Do the needles \nof the compasses come back to their original \npositions?\n\t\nz Insert an iron nail in the paper cylinder (Fig. 4.3d) \nand repeat the steps. Is there any difference in \nthe deflection of the compass needles?\n\t\nz Place some iron paper clips near the two ends \nof the nail. Are the clips attracted to the ends of \nthe nail?\nIt is observed that when current is passed through \nthe cylindrical coil, it behaves like a magnet and \ndeflects the needle of a magnetic compass. When an \niron nail is inserted in the core of the coil, then the \ncoil becomes a stronger magnet and the deflection of \nthe magnetic compass needle is much more. It also \nattracts iron clips (Fig. 4.3e). When the current is \nstopped, the cylindrical coil loses its magnetic effect. \nA current carrying coil that behaves as a magnet is \ncalled an electromagnet. For practical applications, \nmost electromagnets have an iron core to make them \nstronger.\nDoes electromagnet also have \ntwo poles like a bar magnet?\nActivity 4.4: Let us investigate\n\t\nz Take the electromagnet made in Activity 4.3 and a magnetic \ncompass. Label the two ends of the coil as A and B.\n\t\nz Place the magnetic compass near the end A of the coil as \nshown in Fig. 4.4a.\n\t\nz Connect the coil to the cell and observe the compass. Note down \nwhich pole of the magnetic compass is attracted to end A.\nChapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects\nAs we have learnt earlier, when two magnets are brought close \nto each other, their unlike poles (North–South) attract each other. \nSo, if north pole of the magnetic compass is attracted towards \nend A of the electromagnet, then end A is south pole.\n\t\nz Repeat this procedure to find the polarity of end B as well \n(Fig. 4.4b). Did you find that the polarity of end B is opposite \nto the polarity of end A?\nWe learnt in grade 6 that a magnet has two poles. Just like a \nmagnet, an electromagnet also has two poles — North and South.\nThink like a scientist \nRepeat Activity 4.3 with — (i) 2 and 4 cells with the same coil, (ii) 2 cells but \ndifferent number of turns of the coil. What do you observe?\nA single cell provides only a small amount of current, so the magnetic \nfield is weak. As a result, the deflection of compass needle is less and the coil \ncan only attract a few clips. A battery with more cells gives a larger current \nas compared to that with a single cell. This creates a stronger magnetic field, \nso the deflection of the compass needle is more and the coil can attract \nmore clips. The increase in number of turns of the coil also makes the coil a \nstronger magnet! \nAlso, repeat Activity 4.4 by changing the direction of the current. \nSo, the strength of an electromagnet can be changed by changing the amount \nof electric current flowing through the coil or the number of turns of the coil, \nor both. Also, its poles can be reversed by changing the direction of the current.\nDo you remember learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring \nMagnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6) that a freely suspended magnet rests \nalong the north–south direction because our Earth itself behaves \nlike a giant magnet? But why does Earth behave like a magnet? Deep \ninside the Earth, the movement of liquid iron in the core creates \nelectric currents, which generate a magnetic field. Many migratory \nbirds, fish, and animals use this field to navigate across continents \nand oceans. The Earth’s magnetic field also acts as a shield, blocking \nharmful particles from space, and helps protect life on Earth.\nA step further\nFig. 4.4: Compass needle near (a) End A; (b) End B of an electromagnet\n(a)\nA\nA\nB\nB\n(b)\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n4.1.2 Lifting electromagnets\nLifting \nelectromagnets \nare \nstrong \nelectromagnets, that may be hung to the \ncranes. The crane operator can control the \nmagnet by switching the current ON and OFF. When the current \nis turned ON, the electromagnet lifts the iron/steel objects; when \nthe current is switched OFF, magnetic field disappears, and the \nobjects are released. Lifting electromagnets are widely used in \nfactories and scrap yards, to move, lift, and sort heavy metal \nitems efficiently.\nA step further\nWe have learnt that when electric current flows through a \nconductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it. In \nthe higher grades, you will learn even more about this wonderful \nlink between electricity and magnetism, including the exciting idea \nthat just as electricity can produce magnetism, a moving magnet \ncan also lead to an electric current. This deep connection between \nelectricity and magnetism is vital to our daily lives, as it forms the \nbasis of many devices, from electric motors to power generators.\n4.2 Does a Current Carrying Wire Get Hot?\nActivity 4.5: Let us observe\nIn this activity, we will use a special kind \nof wire, called a nichrome wire.\n\t\nz Take a cardboard piece of about 10 cm \nlength and 10 cm width, two nails, \na nichrome wire of thickness about \n0.3  mm (26–28 gauge) and length of \n10 cm, an electric cell, a cell holder, a \nswitch, and connecting wires. \n\t\nz Mount the nails on the cardboard about 5 cm apart.\n\t\nz Tie the nichrome wire between these nails and make the \nconnections as shown in Fig. 4.5 with the switch in OFF \nposition.\n\t\nz Touch the nichrome wire. What do you feel?\n\t\nz Move the switch to ON position for about 30 s and then \nmove it back to OFF. Touch the nichrome wire momentarily \nWhile doing the activity for \nelectromagnet, did you also \nnotice that the wire ends \ngot warm? Why would that \nhappen?\nAre electromagnets also \nused in real life, for \nlifting objects?\nChapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects\n(Do not hold the nichrome wire). \nWhat difference do you feel?\n\t\nz Repeat the last two steps to \nconfirm the observation.\nYou may have observed that nichrome wire \nfeels warm when current is passed through it. \nThis happens because, when electric current \nflows through any conductor, it faces some \nopposition or resistance to its flow. Different \nconductors offer different levels of resistance \nto the flow of current. A nichrome wire, for \nexample, offers higher resistance compared to \na copper wire of the same size and length. This \nresistance causes some of the electrical energy to \nbe converted into heat energy. When an electric \ncurrent passes through a conductor, it gets \nheated. This warming is known as the heating \neffect of electric current.\nThink like a scientist \nThis activity should be carried out strictly under the supervision \nof a teacher.\nRepeat Activity 4.5 with a battery of 2 cells. What do you notice? \nFor the same duration, does the wire heat up more with one cell or \ntwo cells?\nThe amount of heat generated is more in the experiment with \n2 cells. This is due to the fact that the heat generated depends on \nthe magnitude of the electric current. The heat generated in a wire \ndepends on the material, thickness, and length of the wire, and the \nduration for which the current flows. \nIn Grade 7, we have learnt that an incandescent lamp glows \nbecause its filament is heated by an electric current. Many \nhousehold appliances, such as electric room heaters, stoves, \nirons, \nimmersion \nrods, \nwater \nheaters, kettles, and hair dryers \n(Fig. 4.6) work on the same principle \nof the heating effect of electric \ncurrent. All these devices contain a \nrod or a coil of wire, called a heating \nelement. In some appliances where \nthis element is visible, it can be seen glowing red hot.\nFig. 4.5: Heating effect in a wire\nOh, now I understand why \nthe incandescent torch lamp \nsometimes used to get warm \nwhen we did the activity \nof making it glow using an \nelectric cell.\nSafety First\nSafety first\nDo not touch the wire for an extended \nperiod to avoid any injuries.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nThe heating effect of electric \ncurrent is useful in many everyday \nappliances. But sometimes, it can \ncause problems, like energy loss \nin \nwires \nduring \ntransmission. \nOverheating in appliances may cause \ndamage to plugs and sockets where \nplastic parts may melt, or even lead \nto fires. In household circuits, there \nare safety devices placed in the \ncircuit to minimise such incidents.\nEver heard of ...\nBeyond household use, heating effect of electric current has \nseveral industrial applications. One notable example is in \nsteel manufacturing industries, where a specially designed \nhigh-temperature furnace (an enclosed space built to generate heat) \nuses electric current to produce heat. This is used to melt and \nrecycle  scrap steel, converting it into usable steel. \n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\nFig. 4.6: Simple household electric heating appliances (a) Room heater;  \n(b) Electric stove; (c) Electric kettle; (d) Electric iron; (e) Water heating \nimmersion coil; or (f) Hair dryer\n(f)\nTo prevent unnecessary heating \nin household switchboards, it is \nimportant to use appropriate \nwires, plugs, and sockets that are \nrated for the specified electric \ncurrent of the connections.\nA step further\nChapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects\nYes, but have you ever wondered \nwhat is inside these cells and \nbatteries that produces electricity?\nThe portable sources of electricity, \nsuch as cells and batteries, are so \nfascinating. Using these, we could \nlight up a small lamp, make a magnet, \nand heat up a wire.\n4.3 How Does a Battery Generate Electricity?\nLet us start with one of the earliest types of electric cells ever made.\n4.3.1 Voltaic cell\nA Voltaic cell, also known as Galvanic cell, is \nshown in Fig. 4.7. It contains two metal plates \nmade of different materials and a liquid called \nan electrolyte, placed in a glass or plastic \ncontainer. The plates, called electrodes, are \npartly dipped in the electrolyte, which is usually \na weak acid or salt solution. A chemical reaction \nbetween the plates and the electrolyte produces \nelectricity. When the circuit is connected, \nelectric current flows from the positive terminal \nthrough the circuit to the negative terminal. \nOver time, the chemicals get used up, and the \ncell stops working. It is then called ‘dead’ and \ncannot supply any more electricity. \nEver heard of ...\nThe Voltaic or Galvanic cells get their names from two Italian \nscientists, Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani. In the late 1700s, \nGalvani noticed that a dead frog’s leg kicked when touched with \ntwo different metals — copper and iron. It was already known by \nthen that electricity could stimulate muscular motion and Galvani \nthought the electricity came from the frog itself. But Volta had a \ndifferent idea. He believed the electricity came from the metals, and \nnot the frog. To test this, he used saltwater-soaked paper instead of \nthe frog’s leg and still got an electric current. This showed that it \nwas the combination of metals and liquid that generated electric \ncurrent — leading to the invention of the first battery!\nConnecting \nwire\nElectric \ncurrent\nElectric \nlamp\nElectrode 1\nGlass \ncontainer\nElectrolyte\n(Liquid)\nFig. 4.7: Simple representation of \na Voltaic cell\nElectrode 2\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nActivity 4.6: Let us construct \n\t\nz Take five or six juicy lemons, copper wires/\nstrips (1–2 mm thick) and iron nails. Also take \none LED and some connecting wires.\n\t\nz Insert the copper wire and the iron nail in one \nof the lemons keeping them apart by a small \ndistance as shown in Fig. 4.8a. \n\t\nz Repeat the above step for all the remaining lemons.\n\t\nz Join the copper wires and nails as shown in \nFig. 4.8b.\n\t\nz Connect the LED between the copper wire of the \nfirst lemon and the iron nail of the last lemon, using \nconnecting wires. What do you observe? Does the \nLED glow?\n\t\nz If the LED does not glow, \nreverse \nits \nconnections. \nDoes the LED glow now? \n[Remember that we have \nlearnt earlier that current \ncan pass through the LED \nonly when the positive \nterminal (longer wire) of \nthe LED is connected to \nthe positive terminal of \nthe battery, and negative \nterminal (shorter wire) of \nthe LED is connected to the negative terminal of the battery].\nA glowing LED indicates that your cell is working. In this cell, \nthe metal electrodes are the copper wires and the iron nails. \nThe electrolyte is the lemon juice, which helps conduct electricity. \nYou may also use salt solutions instead of lemon juice.\nA step further\nSome common metal pairs for Voltaic cells are zinc/copper, zinc/\nsilver, aluminium/copper, iron/copper, magnesium/copper, and \nlead/copper. Some metals — like copper — act as positive electrodes, \nyet some other metals — like zinc — act as negative electrodes. This \nis due to their chemical properties. We will learn more about this \nin the higher grades.\nCan we also make \nour own Voltaic \ncell using easily \navailable materials?\n(a)\nFig. 4.8: (a) Electric cell made using lemons;  \n(b) Connections in lemon cell\n(b)\nIron \nnail\nLemon\nLED\nCopper \nstrip\nChapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects\n4.3.2 Dry cells\nVoltaic cells were an important discovery, but they are not \nconvenient for everyday use. Instead, dry cells are one of the most \nwidely used electric cells today. They are called \n‘dry’ because the electrolyte is not a liquid but \na thick moist paste. The structure of a dry cell is \nshown in Fig. 4.9. It consists of a zinc container \nwhich acts as a negative terminal and a carbon \nrod at the centre covered with metal cap that \nacts as the positive terminal. The carbon rod is \nsurrounded by the paste-like electrolyte.\nThe dry cell is a single use cell, meaning \nonce it is used up, it has to be disposed of. \nFor several applications, rechargeable batteries \nare increasingly being used now.\n4.3.3 Rechargeable batteries\nRechargeable batteries can be recharged and reused multiple \ntimes. This prevents wastage and saves money over time as well. \nFig. 4.10: Typical rechargeable batteries used in (a) Laptops; (b) Mobile \nphones; (c) Camera; (d) Inverter; (e) Vehicles; (f) Charging a mobile phone \n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(a)\n(e)\n(f)\nOh, so this is the reason \nwhy after a year or \ntwo, the phone battery \nrequires charging more \noften!\nThere are many different kinds of rechargeable batteries that \nare used for different applications — from small batteries used \nin watches and phones to batteries used in \nlaptops and tablet to bigger batteries that run \ninverters or drive electric vehicles (Fig. 4.10). \nHowever, rechargeable batteries also do not \nlast forever. After being charged and used \nmany times, they slowly wear out.\nMetal cap\nCarbon rod\nElectrolyte\nZinc container\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4.9: (a) Dry cell; (b) Its internal structure\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nA step further\nToday, the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is the most common type of \nrechargeable battery, found in almost all devices that use batteries. \nThese batteries rely on special metals like lithium and cobalt, which \nare mined and processed in limited parts of the world. Because \nof this, countries are now racing to secure supplies, recycle old \nbatteries, and develop new technologies.\nScientists are also working on the next big leap: solid-state \nbatteries, which replace the liquid or paste-like electrolytes with \nsolid materials. These future batteries would be much safer, charge \nfaster and last longer. Improved rechargeable batteries are very \nimportant as the world moves to developing environmentally \nfriendly sources of electrical power.   \nSnapshots  \n\t\n\nWhen electric current flows through a conductor (like a wire), it \nproduces a magnetic field around it.

Sonali and Ragini were excited to go \ncycling. Their summer vacation had just begun, and they wanted \nto explore the beautiful landscapes around their village. After \npumping air into their bicycle tyres, they set off. As they rode \nthrough the village, the wind rushed past them. “Oh no! The \nwind is pushing me hard!” said Ragini. Smiling, Sonali replied, \n“We are riding against the wind. We must push our pedals harder \nto move faster.”\nTheir ride took them up a long path to a hilltop. Some parts \nof the road were rough where they found it hard to pedal, while \nother parts were smoother. When they reached the top and were \nenjoying the view, they heard thunder and saw flashes of lightning \nat a distance. Even though it looked beautiful, they decided to \nhead back immediately. On the way back, while passing a herd of \nsheep, they pressed their bicycle bells and turned the handles to \nchange direction.\nAs they were coming down the slope of the hill, they realised \nthat their bicycles were moving down at a great speed even \nthough they were not pedalling! Sonali yelled, “It’s thrilling! It \nseems something is pulling us downhill, what could it be?”\n5.1 What Is a Force?\nLet us try to experience the push and the pull.\nActivity 5.1: Let us explore\n\t\nz Take a large cardboard box. \n\t\nz Try moving the box in as many different ways as you can \nthink of.\nDid you move the box in any other way than shown in Fig. 5.1? \nIn all the ways that you might have used to move the box, you \nhad to apply a push or pull to the box. Generally, the push or pull \napplied on an object is called force in science.\nFig. 5.1: Moving a box in different ways (a) Pushing; (b) Pulling;  \n(c) Lifting (pulling up), and carrying\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n5.2 \u0007What Can a Force Do to the Bodies on \nWhich It Is Applied?\nWe experience push or pull in our daily lives all the time, often \nwithout even realising it. Let us recall some of these experiences \nand analyse them.\nActivity 5.2: Let us analyse\n\t\nz Think of situations where a force (push or pull) is applied \nand list them in Table 5.1.\n\t\nz Analyse each situation and write the effect of the force \nin Table 5.1.

Does a force \ncause a moving object to stop? Can it change speed, or direction \nof motion, or change the shape of an object?\nFig. 5.2: Applying force on objects\nChapter 5 — Exploring Forces\nIn everyday life, we come across many situations where a force \nis applied, for example, opening a drawer, stretching a rubber \nband, a fielder stopping a ball, kicking a football, applying brakes \non a moving bicycle, rolling a chapati, or turning the steering \nhandle of an autorickshaw. What effect can the application of \nforce have on objects?\nThe force applied on an object may\n\t\nz make an object move from rest.\n\t\nz change the speed of an object if it is moving.\n\t\nz change the direction of motion of an object.\n\t\nz bring about a change in the shape of an object.\n\t\nz cause some or all of these effects.\n5.3 \u0007Are Forces an Interaction Between Two \nor More Objects?\nWhen you push a table, your hand is one object applying force \non another object — the table. Here, we say that your hand and \nthe table are two objects interacting with each other. \nThink of all the actions listed in Table 5.1. How many objects \nare involved in each of the actions? Do you notice that forces \nresult only when two objects are interacting in some way or \nthe other? From these examples, we can infer that at least two \nobjects must interact for a force to come into play.\nA force is a push or pull on an object resulting from the \nobject’s interaction with another object. The SI unit of force is \nnewton (written with a small ‘n’) and its symbol is N.\nA step further\nSuppose an object is at rest. Does it mean that no force is acting \non this object? It means that the forces acting on the object are \nbalancing one another. You will learn about balanced forces in \nhigher grades.\nDoes \nthis \nmean \nthat \nwhenever there is a change \nin speed or direction, or \nchange in shape, a force is \nacting on the object?\nYes, none of these take \nplace without the action \nof force.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nFig. 5.3: Use of muscular force by living beings\nA step further\nWhen you pushed the table with your hand, did you feel a force \non your hand too? The moment you stopped pushing, the force on \nyour hand disappeared. Whenever two objects interact, each object \nexperiences a force from the other. As soon as the interaction \nceases, the two objects no longer experience the force. \n5.4 What Are the Different Types of Forces?\n5.4.1 Contact forces\nIn many situations, we find that to apply a force on an object, \nphysical contact is necessary between our body and the object. \nThis contact can be direct, such as using our hands or other body \nparts, or indirect, such as using a stick or rope. Forces of this \ntype which act only when there is physical contact between the \nobjects are called contact forces.\nMuscular force\nAn example of contact force is muscular force. When we perform \nany physical activity, such as walking, running, lifting, pushing, \njumping, or stretching, the force is caused by the action of muscles \nin our body. The force resulting due to the action of muscles is \nknown as muscular force. Muscular force occurs when muscles \ncontract and elongate while doing any activity. \nAnimals, birds, fish, and insects use muscular forces for \nmovement and survival.\nChapter 5 — Exploring Forces\nHumans used the muscular force of some animals to carry \nout many tasks for a long time.\nFig. 5.4: Use of muscular force of animals to assist with human tasks\nEver heard of ...\nMuscular force plays an important role in many functions inside \nour body too. This force helps us chew food and push it through \nthe alimentary canal during the process of digestion. The expansion \nand contraction of our heart muscles allows the blood to circulate \nin our body — a process essential for survival.\nFriction\nA ball rolling on a flat ground stops on its own \nafter some time. If we stop pedalling our bicycle \non a flat road, it slows down and comes to a stop. \nIf the road is rough, it stops sooner than on a smoother road. \nYou must have come across many such experiences. What causes \nthe change in the speed of objects in such situations? We have \nlearnt earlier that a force is essential to change the speed of an \nobject. However, in all these situations no force appears to be \nacting on the objects, yet their speed gradually decreases and \nthey come to a stop after some time. Is it possible that some force \nis indeed acting on them? Which force is that?\nActivity 5.3: Let us investigate\n\t\nz Take an object with a flat base (such as an empty lunch box/ \ngeometry box/ a notebook) and place it on a table or floor.\n\t\nz Gently push it and observe. Does it stop after travelling some \ndistance? Is there a force acting on it which brings it to rest?\n\t\nz Now repeat by pushing the object in the opposite direction. \nDoes it stop again after travelling some distance?\nIs there any other \ncontact force?\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nOn pushing, the object stops after sliding a certain \ndistance. This must be due to a force acting between the \nsurfaces of the sliding object and the table or floor which \nare in contact. This force must be acting on the object in a \ndirection opposite to its direction of motion. This force is \nwhat brings the object to a stop. \nThe force that comes into play when an object moves \nor tries to move over another surface is called the force \nof friction or simply friction. Friction always acts in a \ndirection opposite to the direction in which the object is \nmoving or trying to move. The force of friction is a contact \nforce since it arises due to two surfaces in contact.\nFriction arises due to the irregularities in the two surfaces in \ncontact. Even surfaces which appear smooth, have a large number \nof minute irregularities (Fig. 5.6). When placed in contact, the \nirregularities of two surfaces lock into each other and oppose \nany effort to move one surface over the other.\nFig. 5.6: Friction between two surfaces due to irregularities\nFig. 5.5: Friction acts between \ntwo surfaces and opposes the \nmotion of the object.\nActivity 5.4: Let us explore\n\t\nz Try Activity 5.3 again, but this time place the same object on \ndifferent surfaces, such as glass, cloth, wood, ceramic tile, \nand sand. \n\t\nz Does the object stop after travelling the same distance as in \nActivity 5.3?\n\t\nz Does the object stop at the same distance on all surfaces?\nFor different surfaces, the object stops after moving different \ndistances so we can say that the force of friction depends upon \nthe nature of the surfaces in contact. Friction is greater on rough \nsurfaces.\nA step further\nDoes the force or friction act only if the objects are moving on solid \nsurfaces? What about objects moving through liquids and gases? Air, \nwater, and other liquids also exert force of friction on the objects \nmoving through them. Hence the objects, such as aeroplanes, ships, \nboats, or high-speed trains are designed with specific shapes to \nreduce the force of friction due to the air or water around them.\nDoes this mean that\nthe force of friction\nwill be greater if the\nsurfaces are rough?\nChapter 5 — Exploring Forces\n5.4.2 Non-contact forces\nThere are forces whose effect can be experienced even if the \nobjects are not in contact. These forces are called non-contact \nforces. Let us learn about non-contact forces.\nMagnetic force\nDo you remember learning about magnets in the chapter \n‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? We learnt that a \nmagnet attracts objects made of magnetic materials. When two \nmagnets are brought close to each other, like poles (North–North, \nSouth–South) repel each other while unlike poles (North–South) \nattract each other. In an earlier chapter of this book, we also learnt \nabout electromagnets which behave like magnets. Attraction \nand repulsion between objects are also a form of push and pull, \nthat is, a force. Can you recall that a magnet could exert force on \nanother magnet or a magnetic material without being in contact \nwith it?\nActivity 5.5: Let us test\n\t\nz Take two ring magnets and a wooden stick.\n\t\nz While holding the stick in a vertical position over a wooden \ntable, insert one ring magnet onto the stick (Fig. 5.7).\n\t\nz Now insert the second ring magnet above it such that the like \npoles of the two magnets face each other. Does the second \nmagnet stay floating above the first magnet?\n\t\nz Try pushing the second magnet down gently. Do you feel a \nforce on it?\n\t\nz Now, reverse the poles of both the magnets. Does the second \nmagnet still remain floating?\nWe find that a magnet can exert force on another magnet \nwithout being in contact with it.\nThe force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or a \nmagnetic material is called magnetic force. Since a magnet can \nexert a force from a distance without being in contact it is called \na non-contact force.\nAre there more such forces which act from a distance?\nFig. 5.7: Force between \ntwo ring magnets\nIs it essential for an object \napplying force on another object \nto always be in contact with it?\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nElectrostatic force\nActivity 5.6: Let us experiment\n\t\nz Take a plastic scale or a plastic straw, a piece of \npolythene, and small pieces of paper.\n\t\nz Rub plastic scale/straw vigorously with polythene.\n\t\nz Do not touch the rubbed part with your hand or \nany metal object.\n\t\nz Now, bring it close to the small pieces of paper placed \non a table, taking care not to touch the paper pieces \n(Fig. 5.8). Do you notice something surprising?\nThe paper pieces get pulled towards the plastic scale/straw \nand stick to it when it is brought close to paper pieces. Why does \nthis happen?\nWhen two objects of certain materials are rubbed together, \nelectrical charges build up on their surfaces. These charges are \ncalled static charges as they do not move by themselves. The \nobject that acquires static charges is said to be a charged object. \nA charged object attracts, that is, exerts a force on uncharged \nobjects made of certain materials, such as small pieces of paper. \nThis force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact.\nLet us do another activity with objects made of different \nmaterials.\nActivity 5.7: Let us experiment\n\t\nz Take two balloons, a length of thread, and a woollen \ncloth.\n\t\nz Inflate two balloons and hang them in such a way that \nthey do not touch each other as shown in Fig. 5.9a. \n\t\nz Rub both balloons with the woollen cloth and release \nthem. Be careful not to touch the rubbed balloons \nwith your fingers. What do you observe?\nWe observe that the balloons move away from each \nother as if they are repelling each other (Fig. 5.9b).\n\t\nz Now bring the woollen cloth used for rubbing \nthe balloons close to one of the rubbed balloons. \nWhat happens?\nThey move towards each other as if they are attracting \neach other. What do we infer from these observations?\nFig. 5.8: Charged plastic scale \nattracting small paper pieces\nFig. 5.9: (a) Two uncharged \nballoons; (b) Two charged \nballoons repelling each other\n(a)\n(b)\nChapter 5 — Exploring Forces\nWe found that the two similarly charged \nballoons repel each other whereas a charged \nballoon and the woollen cloth (with which the \nballoon was rubbed) attract each other. Does \nthis indicate that the charge on the balloon is of a different kind \nfrom the charge on the woollen cloth?  \nSince the balloons were charged in the same way, we can say \nthat they have acquired similar charges. As the similarly charged \nballoons repelled each other, we can infer that similar (like) \ncharges repel each other. Both the rubbing object and the rubbed \nobject get charged but they acquire opposite kind of charges. \nTheir attraction shows that opposite kind (unlike) of charges \nattract each other. The two kinds of static charges are said to be \n‘positive’ and ‘negative’.\nThe force exerted by a charged body on another charged \nbody or an uncharged body is called electrostatic force. It is a \nnon-contact force.\nDoes it mean that \nthere are two kinds of \nelectrical charges?\nGravitational force\nActivity 5.8: Let us observe\n\t\nz Take a ball and throw it vertically upwards. Does it come \ndown?\n\t\nz Now throw it again, but this time harder. Does it still fall \nback down to the ground?\nThink about different situations around you where any object \nthrown up in any direction, finally falls or comes back to the \nground or floor.\nFig. 5.10: Some objects falling towards the Earth\nA step further\nWhen the charges move, they constitute an electric current in an \nelectrical circuit. It is the same current which makes a lamp glow \nor generates a heating effect or a magnetic effect.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nSince all the objects fall towards the Earth, it means the Earth \nattracts (pulls) them. The force with which the Earth attracts objects \ntowards itself is called the gravitational force. The gravitational \nforce exerted by the Earth is also called force of gravity or \nsimply gravity. \nSince the gravitational force \nacts without contact with the object \nit attracts, it is a non-contact force. \nGravitational force is always an \nattractive force, unlike magnetic \nforce or electrostatic force, which \ncan either be attractive or repulsive.\nYou might have noticed that \nwhen an object is dropped from a \nheight, it takes a straight vertical \npath downwards before touching \nthe ground (Fig.  5.11a). When \nan object is thrown vertically \nupwards, the object moves up \nstraight, \nslows \ndown, \nstops \nmomentarily at the top, and then \ntakes a straight vertical path \ndownwards (Fig. 5.11b).\nWhile going up, the speed \nof the object goes on decreasing till the object comes to a stop, \nits direction of motion changes and while coming down the \nspeed goes on increasing. We say that the object \nundergoes a vertical motion when it moves in \na vertical direction under the influence of the \ngravitational force.\n5.5 Weight and Its Measurement \nThe force with which the Earth pulls an object towards itself is \ncalled the weight of the object. The weight measures how strongly \nan object is pulled by the Earth. Since the weight is a force, it is \nmeasured in the same unit as that of force. Therefore, SI unit of \nweight is also newton (N).\nIs \nthere \nany \nforce \nwhich acts on them? \nWhat exerts this force?\nWhy \ndo \nall \nthe \nobjects fall towards \nthe Earth?\nDoes \nthe \nEarth \npull every object \nwith equal force?\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 5.11: (a) Dropping an object from a height;  \n(b) Throwing an object vertically upwards\nChapter 5 — Exploring Forces\nLet us now try to find out if the Earth pulls every object with \nequal force.\nActivity 5.9: Let us explore\n\t\nz Take a spring and a few objects of different masses, \nsuch as a pencil box, a tiffin box, and a small stone.\n\t\nz Hang one end of the spring from a nail. From the other \nend, hang an object and observe the spring. Does the \nspring stretch? \n\t\nz Now hang the other objects, one by one and notice the \nstretch in the spring each time. Is the stretch caused by \neach object the same?\nWhen an object is hung from a spring, the spring \nstretches due to the force applied on the object by the Earth. \nWe find that the stretch caused in the spring is different \nfor different objects. This indicates that the Earth pulls \ndifferent objects with different forces, that is, the weight \nof different objects is different. Can we use the spring to \nmeasure the weight of an object?\nA step further\nA spring balance is a simple device used to measure weight (force). \nIt consists of a spring fixed at one end, with a hook attached at \nthe other end. When we hang an object from the hook, the spring \nstretches, and the amount of stretching gives the weight of the object. \nThere is a scale on the balance which is marked to show the weight \n(force) in newton. Usually, there is also another scale to show the \ncorresponding values of mass in gram (g). These values have been \nmarked with the assumption that the spring balance is used on the \nEarth, with the Earth’s gravitational force attracting the object.\n(b)\nFig. 5.12: (a) A hanging spring; \n(b) Two different objects hung \nfrom the spring\n(a)\nLet us learn to measure the weight using a spring balance. But \nfirst, let us familiarise ourselves with a spring balance the way \nwe did with thermometer earlier (in the chapter ‘Temperature \nand Its Measurement’ in Curiosity, Grade 6).\nActivity 5.10: Let us observe\n\t\nz Look at the spring balance shown in Fig. 5.13 carefully. What \nis the maximum weight it can measure? \nThe maximum weight it can measure is 10 N. Thus, this scale \nhas a range of 0 to 10 N.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nLet us now try to find the smallest value of weight that \ncan be measured by the spring balance.\nActivity 5.11: Let us calculate\n\t\nz Look at the spring balance shown in Fig. 5.13 and note \ndown the following:\n\t\n{\nHow much is the weight difference indicated \nbetween the two bigger marks? \nThe weight difference indicated between 0 and 01 N \nor between 01 N and 02 N is 1 N.\n\t\n{\nHow many divisions (shown by smaller marks) are \nthere between these two bigger marks?\nThere are 5 divisions between these marks.\n\t\n{\nHow much weight does one small division indicate? \nFig. 5.14: Object suspended \nfrom a spring balance\nOne small division can read \n1 N\n5  = 0.2 N.\nSo, the smallest value that the spring balance can read is 0.2 N.\nNow using this method, calculate the smallest value of weight \nthat can be measured with the spring balance given to you. Your \nschool laboratory may have spring balances for which the range and \nthe value of the smallest division may be different. It is, therefore, \nalways necessary to look carefully at the spring balance (or any \nother instrument) you are about to use.\nLet us now learn how to measure weight using a spring balance.\nActivity 5.12: Let us measure\n\t\nz Take a spring balance and a few objects. Keep in mind that \nthe objects should not be heavier than the maximum value of \nweight the spring balance can measure, otherwise it may get \ndamaged.\n\t\nz Suspend the objects one by one from the hook (Fig. 5.14). Read \nthe scale for weight carefully and record your observations \nin the Table 5.2.\nS.No.\nObject\nWeight (N)\n1.\nPencil Box\n2.\nPartially filled water bottle\nTable 5.2: \u0007Measuring weight using a spring \nbalance\nFig. 5.13: A spring \nbalance and close-up \nof its scale\nChapter 5 — Exploring Forces\nYou can repeat Activities 5.10 to 5.12 for the mass scale shown \non the left side on the spring balance (Fig. 5.13) to measure the \nmass of an object.\nA step further\nThe mass of an object can be measured indirectly by measuring its \nweight (using a spring balance) or by comparing its weight with the \nweight of an object of a known mass (using a beam balance). Since \nthe weight of an object remains almost the same everywhere on the \nEarth, so for all practical purposes it is acceptable to weigh an object \nto find its mass.\nAs we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Materials \nAround Us’ in Curiosity, Grade 6), mass is the amount \nof matter in an object and is measured in grams (g) \nor kilograms (kg). Its value remains the same at every \nplace. Weight, on the other hand, is the gravitational force \nwith which the Earth (or another planet) pulls an object. Since \ngravitational force can vary very slightly from place to place on \nthe Earth (and can be very different on different planets), weight \ncan change, but mass does not.\nWhat is the difference \nbetween weight and \nmass?\nA step further\nThe gravitational force of different planets on an object is different. \nThus, the weight of an object is different on different planets, as shown \nin the following table, even though its mass remains the same.\nPlanet\nEarth\nMoon\nMars\nVenus\nJupiter\nMass of \nthe object 1 kg\n1 kg\n1 kg\n1 kg\n1 kg\nWeight of \nthe object 10 N\n1.6 N\n3.8 N\n9 N\n25.4 N\nA step further\nIn everyday life, particularly for the goods we commonly use, we \nare more interested in the amount of matter in an object (its mass), \nrather than the force applied by the Earth upon it (its weight). \nHowever, though while the units of mass are used, instead of the \nterm mass, the term weight is typically used. For example, it is said \nthat the weight of the wheat bag is 10 kg. But in scientific use, this \nis not correct and it is important to use the correct terms with their \ncorrect units, even if every day language is more casual.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nActivity 5.13: Let us investigate\n\t\nz Take an empty plastic bottle (with its lid closed tightly) and a \nbucket full of water.\n\t\nz Push the bottle in the water (Fig. 5.15). Do you feel an upward \npush? Release the bottle. Does it bounce up?\nYou would have felt an upward push and the bottle bounces \nback to the surface of the water. This indicates that water applies \na force on the bottle in the upward direction. In fact, all liquids \napply a similar force. The force applied by a liquid on an object \nin the upward direction is known as upthrust or buoyant force. \nWhen an object is placed in a liquid, the gravitational force due \nto the Earth acts on it downwards. But a buoyant force is applied \non it by the liquid in the upward direction. If the gravitational \nforce is more than the buoyant force, the object sinks, but if the \ntwo forces are equal, the object floats. One of the factors on which \nthe buoyant force depends upon, is the density of the liquid. You \nwill learn about density in a later chapter of this book.\nFig. 5.15: Plastic bottle \nin water\nA step further\nArchimedes, a famous Greek scientist, discovered that when an \nobject is fully or partially immersed in a liquid, it experiences an \nupward force which is equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces. \nThis is known as Archimedes’ Principle. If the weight of a liquid \ndisplaced by an object is smaller than the weight of the object, the \nobject will sink in the liquid. If the weight of the liquid displaced is \nequal to the weight of the object, the object will float in the liquid.\n5.6 Floating and Sinking \nWhile taking out water from \na bucket filled with water \nusing a mug, do you notice \nthat the mug feels lighter \nwhen it is inside water? Let \nus try to understand this.\nIf we place some objects on water, some of \nthem float, while others fall to the bottom. \nThe gravitational force of the Earth is \nacting on all objects, then why don’t all \nobjects fall to the bottom?\nEver heard of ...\nThere are some rocks which can float on water. \nOne such rock is Pumice, which is formed during \nvolcanic eruptions. When lava with lots of gas and \nwater vapour cools quickly, it traps tiny bubbles of \ngas inside. This creates a light, porous rock — filled \nwith air pockets which is less dense than water and floats on it.\nChapter 5 — Exploring Forces\nColumn A (Type of force)\nColumn B (Example)\n(i) Muscular force\n(a)\nA cricket ball stopping on its own just \nbefore touching the boundary line\n(ii) Magnetic force\n(b)\nA child lifting a school bag\n(iii) Frictional force\n(c)\nA fruit falling from a tree\n(iv) Gravitational force\n(d)\nBalloon rubbed on woollen cloth \nattracting hair strands\n(v) Electrostatic force\n(e)\nA compass needle pointing North\nKeep the curiosity alive\n1.\t Match items in Column A with the items in Column B.\nSnapshots  \n\t\n\nA force is push or pull on an object resulting from the object’s interaction \nwith another object. \n\t\n\nThe SI unit of force is newton and its symbol is N. \n\t\n\nForces can act with or without contact.\n\t\n\nMuscular force and frictional force are some of the examples of contact \nforces.\n\t\n\nMagnetic force, gravitational force, and electrostatic force are \nnon-contact forces.\n\t\n\nForce can change an object’s speed, direction of its motion, or both.

Have you ever wondered \nwhy fallen leaves rise in the air or trees sway or bend? Does the \nwind exert force on fallen leaves to make them rise or on trees \nto bend? Recall other similar effects of the force exerted by wind \nlike slamming of doors or rattling of windows, or fluttering of \nclothes? How does the force exerted by wind make this happen? \nThe force exerted by wind creates wind pressure which causes \nthese effects. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship \nbetween force and pressure, and understand how they shape \npowerful natural events like thunderstorms and cyclones.\n6.1 Pressure\n \nMegha and her brother Pawan are going on a picnic. They walk \nto the picnic spot, carrying identical items in their bags (Fig. 6.1). \nOn the way, Pawan keeps adjusting his bag, and looks \nuncomfortable. Megha asks, “Is there a problem with \nyour bag?” Pawan responds, “Yes, it is hurting my \nshoulders.” Megha says, “Both our bags are equally \nheavy. Why does your bag hurt, and mine doesn’t?” \nPawan reflects for a minute and says, “Perhaps, it is \nbecause of the difference in the straps of our bags. \nMy bag has narrow straps while your bag has broad \nstraps.”\nCan the shape or size of the straps really make a \ndifference? Let us try to find out.\nWhen we carry a bag, we feel its weight because \nof the force of gravity acting on our shoulders. The \nweight of the bag with narrow straps acts on a \nsmaller area of our shoulders, whereas the weight of \nthe bag with broad straps is spread out over a larger \narea of our shoulders. It is due to this reason that we feel \nmore comfortable carrying a bag with broader straps than one \nwith narrow straps, although both bags have the same weight. \nSince the area over which the force acts is involved, we define \na quantity called pressure, which is the force per unit area. \nSo, \t\n Pressure = Force\nArea\nAt this stage, we will consider only those forces which act \nperpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed.\nFig. 6.1: Megha and Pawan  \ncarrying their bags\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nBroad straps reduce the pressure exerted by the bag on \nour shoulders as compared to narrow straps. Therefore, we \nfeel more comfortable carrying a bag with broad straps. \nCan you now understand why it feels easier to lift a \nwater-filled bucket with a broad handle than with a narrow \nhandle (Fig. 6.2)? Similarly, we have seen that when people \ncarry loads like pots or vegetable baskets on their heads, they \noften place a round piece of cloth under the loads (Fig. 6.3). In \nboth cases, the objective is to reduce pressure by increasing \nthe area over which the weight acts. \nPressure is defined as the force per unit area. The SI unit \nof force is newton and that of area is metre2. Therefore, the \nSI unit of pressure is newton/metre2 (N/m2). This unit is also \ncalled a pascal, denoted by Pa.\nIf a force of 100 N is applied on a cardboard of area 2 m2, \nthen the pressure applied on the cardboard will be:\nPressure =\n= 50 N/m2\n= \nForce\nArea\n100 N\n2 m2 \nThere are many situations in daily life where pressure plays \na role. Conduct the activities given in Table 6.1 and record your \nobservations.

This is \nwhy it is easier to drive a nail using its pointed end, \nand it is easier to cut an apple with the sharp edge \nof a knife.\nYou must have seen overhead water tanks \n(Fig. 6.4) in your locality, or on the rooftops of houses \nused for water supply. Why are these tanks always \nplaced at a height?\nDo liquids also exert pressure?\nLet us find out by conducting the following activity.\nActivity 6.1: Let us try and find out\n\t\nz Take two transparent glass or plastic pipes of the same \nlength (about 25 cm), but of different diameters, as shown \nin Fig. 6.5. \n\t\nz Take two good-quality rubber balloons. Attach \nthem to one end of each pipe. \n\t\nz Clamp the pipes on a stand as shown in Fig. 6.5.\n\t\nz Now, fill both the pipes with water up to the \nsame level about halfway.\n\t\nz Observe what happens to the balloons.\n\t\nz Do both balloons bulge? Do they bulge to the \nsame extent?\nWhat can you infer from this activity? You must \nhave observed that the two balloons bulge to the \nsame extent. Why is it so? Notice that because of the \ndifferent diameters, the weight of water in the two \npipes is different. However, the bulge in both the \nballoons is the same. This means that the weight of \nwater in the pipes could not be responsible for the \nextent of the bulge of the balloons. \nCould it be that the water column is exerting pressure? Yes, it \nis the pressure exerted by the water column which is responsible \nfor the bulge. That is why equal water column heights produce \nequal bulges in the balloons, despite their different diameters.\nFig. 6.4: Overhead tank\nFig. 6.5: Equal heights of water columns \nproduce same bulge in balloons\nBroad \npipe\nBalloons\nWater\nNarrow \npipe\nStand\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nPour some more water in any one of the pipes \nused in Fig. 6.5. Observe the bulge of the balloon. \nRepeat this process a few times, adding more \nwater each time and noting the extent of bulge as \nshown in Fig. 6.6. \nDo you see any relation between the amount \nof bulge of the rubber balloon and the height of \nthe water column in the pipe? You must have \nobserved that the bulge of the balloon increases \nas the height of the water column increases.\nThus, as the height of the water column in the pipe increases, \nthe pressure at the bottom of the pipe also increases, which causes \nthe balloon to bulge more. So, we can say that the pressure exerted \nby a liquid in a vessel depends on the height of its column. This \nis the reason why overhead tanks are placed at a height so that \nthe pressure in the taps is increased, resulting in a good stream of \nwater from the taps. \nSuppose you are living on the second floor of a three-storeyed \nbuilding and an overhead water tank is placed on the top floor. \nWill you or your friend on the first floor receive a more powerful \nstream of tap water? Give reasons.\n....................................................................................................................\nDo liquids also exert pressure on the walls of the container? \nLet us find out by conducting the following activity.\nActivity 6.2: Let us find out\n\t\nz Take a used plastic bottle and remove its cap. Make \nfour small holes near the bottom around the sides \nusing a needle or a nail. Make sure that the holes are at \nthe same height from the bottom as shown in Fig. 6.7. \n(If you find it difficult to make a hole, you can slightly \nheat the needle and poke it to make holes.) \n\t\nz Seal the holes with a tape and fill the bottle with water. \n\t\nz Now, remove the tape from all holes at the same time. \n\t\nz What do you observe? \nWater\nMore \nwater\nBalloon \nbulges \nout more\nBalloon \nbulges \nout\nFig. 6.6: Higher heights of water column \nproduce bigger bulge of the balloon\nBottle\nWater\nHoles\nFig. 6.7: Liquid exerts pressure \non the wall of the container\nWhat will happen to the \nbulge of the balloon if we \nincrease the height of the \nwater column? \nChapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones\nYou observe water flowing out through the holes on the \nsides of the bottle. What can you infer from this observation? \nIt indicates that water also exerts pressure on the sides of a \ncontainer. Therefore, we can conclude that liquids exert pressure \nnot only at the bottom of the container, but also on its sides. In \nfact liquids exert pressure in all directions.\nYou must have seen water spurting out like a fountain from \nleaking joints or holes in water pipes. Can you explain why this \nhappens? Is it due to the pressure exerted by water on the walls \nof the pipes?\nEver heard of ...\nDo you know that the base of \na dam is much broader than \nthe top? This is because a \nbroad base  not only supports \nthe structure of the dam, but \nalso withstands the horizontal \nwater pressure near the bottom \n(Fig. 6.8). The water stored \nin the dam, exerts pressure \nhorizontally on the side walls \nof the dam and vertically on \nthe floor due to the height of the water level. The pressure which \nacts horizontally, is very large near its bottom. Thus, to withstand the \npressure, the base of the dam is made broader.\nFig. 6.8: Dam\nLet us now try to understand if air also exerts pressure.\n6.2 Pressure Exerted by Air\nYou already know that air is all around us. The envelope of air \nsurrounding the Earth is called atmosphere. The atmospheric \nair contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other \ngases in small quantities. The atmosphere extends up to many \nkilometres above the surface of the Earth.\nLet us find out if the atmosphere exerts pressure by performing \nthe following activity.\nActivity 6.3: Let us explore\n\t\nz Take a paper plate, invert it and attach a stick to it as shown \nin Fig. 6.9a. Place it on a plain surface.\n\t\nz Take two identical sheets of chart paper about 70 cm × 56 cm \neach. Fold one sheet twice and make a hole in the centre of \nFig. 6.9: (a) Inverted \npaper plate setup\nStick\nPaper plate\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nthe folded chart paper sheet — big enough for the \nstick to come out. Place the folded sheet on top \nof the inverted paper plate as shown in Fig. 6.9b.\n\t\nz Now, try to lift the paper plate covered with a \nfolded sheet using the stick.\n\t\nz Observe how much effort is needed to lift it.\n\t\nz Now, place the second unfolded chart paper \nsheet in place of the folded sheet. Make a hole at \nthe centre of this chart paper for the stick to pass \nthrough. Cover the paper plate with the unfolded \nchart paper as shown in Fig. 6.9 c.\n\t\nz \u0007Lift the paper plate again and feel the effort \nneeded in doing so.\n\t\nz In which case is the lifting easier, with the folded \nor the unfolded chart paper covering the paper \nplate?\nYou would have observed that more effort is \nneeded to lift the paper plate when it is covered with \nthe unfolded chart paper, than with the folded chart \npaper. When we cover the paper plate with unfolded \nchart paper, the area of the covering sheet increases. \nThe effort needed to lift the paper plate increases. \nNotice that the weight of the covering sheet has not \nchanged. What can you infer from this? We can \ninfer from these observations that air exerts force \non the covering sheet, which makes it difficult to lift \nthe paper plate. Moreover, this force increases with \nFig. 6.10: A girl \nblowing a balloon\nFig. 6.9: (c) Inverted paper plate \nwith unfolded chart paper\nFig. 6.9: (b) Inverted paper plate \nwith two folds of chart paper\nincrease in the area of covering sheets. It means that the air is \nexerting a force on the paper plate, which increases as the area of \nthe sheet covering it increases. As force per unit area is pressure, \nwe can conclude that air exerts pressure on the paper sheet. In \nfact, air exerts pressure on all objects. The pressure exerted by \nair around us is known as the atmospheric pressure. \nYou must have experienced that when you blow air into a \nballoon, it gets inflated. Why? This is because the air being filled \ninside the balloon exerts pressure on the walls of the balloon \n(Fig 6.10). Can we say that air exerts pressure in all directions? Yes, \nthat is why the balloon expands in all directions. What happens \nwhen an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth? The \nair escapes from the balloon. Why does the air escape from \nthe balloon? \nChapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones\nHave you ever wondered how large the atmospheric pressure \nis? Let us get an idea about its magnitude by performing the \nfollowing activity.\nActivity 6.4: Let us perform\n\t\nz Take a good-quality rubber sucker. Press it firmly against a \nsmooth flat surface (Fig. 6.11). \n\t\nz Do you realise that it sticks to the surface?\n\t\nz Now, try to pull it off. Do you find it difficult to pull it off? \nWhen we press the sucker, most of the air between its cup \nand the surface on which it is placed is pushed out and the air \npressure inside it is reduced. The sucker sticks to the surface \nbecause the pressure of air surrounding the sucker is higher \nthan the pressure exerted by the air inside the sucker. To pull the \nsucker off the surface, the applied force should be strong enough \nto overcome the pressure difference between outside the sucker \nand inside the sucker.\nDo you know how large the atmospheric pressure is? The force \nexerted by the atmospheric air column over an area 15 cm × 15 cm \nis nearly equal to the force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg \n(2250 N). The reason we are not crushed under this weight is that \nthe pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric \npressure. This balances the pressure exerted from outside. The \npressure inside our body is caused by the movement of fluids and \ngases in tissues and organs of the body.\n6.3 Formation of Wind\nYou must have noticed that on some days, the wind blows strongly, \nwhereas on other days, it is calm. Sometimes, wind becomes so \nstrong that it causes damage to life and property. \nYou must have seen that when an inflated balloon is kept \nwithout closing its mouth, the air from the balloon escapes. Recall \nthat when there is a puncture in the bicycle tube, the air escapes \nand the tube collapses. In both of these cases, does air move from \na high pressure region to a low pressure region?  \nThe SI unit of pressure is N/m2, also known as pascal (Pa). However, \nthe practical unit of air pressure is millibar (mb), which is equal to \n100 Pa. Air pressure is also expressed in hectopascal (hPa), which is \nequal to 100 Pa.\nFig. 6.11: A sucker\nA step further\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nLet us find out from the following activity.\nActivity 6.5: Let us observe\n\t\nz Take two similar balloons made of thin rubber, \nand a drinking straw.\n\t\nz Insert one end of the straw into one balloon and \nsecure it with a rubber band or thread.\n\t\nz Now inflate the second balloon and hold its mouth \nwith your fingers, so that air does not escape.\n\t\nz Insert the free end of the straw into the neck of \nthe inflated balloon and secure it with a rubber \nband or thread. Make sure that the air does not leak from the \nballoon as the straw is inserted in it. Now you have one end \nof the straw inside the inflated balloon and the other end \ninside the uninflated balloon as shown in Fig. 6.12.\n\t\nz Predict what would happen to the balloons.\n\t\nz Observe what happens to both the balloons. Did it happen as \npredicted?\n\t\nz Do you observe any change in the size of the balloons? Write \ndown your observations.\n....................................................................................................................\nWhat can be the reason for the change in the sizes of the \nballoons? The air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher \nthan that in the uninflated balloon. As a result, some air moves \nfrom the inflated balloon to the uninflated balloon, resulting in \nchanges in the size of both the balloons.\nDo you notice that after some time both the balloons attain \nalmost the same size and the flow of air stops? Why does the air \nflow stop? The flow of air continues till the air pressure in the \ninflated balloon is higher than the air pressure in the uninflated \nballoon. The air flow stops when the pressure in both balloons \nbecomes equal. At this stage, both balloons are almost of the \nsame size. Thus, we can conclude that air moves from a region of \nhigh air pressure to a region of low air pressure. \nYou can relate this conclusion to the directions of the sea breeze \nand land breeze, which you studied in Curiosity, Grade 7. As land \ngets heated faster than water during the day, the air above the land \nHow do winds form?\nDoes the difference in air \npressure have anything to do \nwith the formation of winds?\nFig. 6.12: Air moves from a \nhigh pressure region to a low \npressure region\nChapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones\nbecomes warmer and lighter. Hence, it rises, creating an area of low \npressure. The air from the high pressure region of the sea blows to \nthe low pressure region which develops on the land, resulting in a \nsea breeze. At night, the water is warmer than the land. Therefore, \na low pressure area develops above the sea. As a result, wind \nblows from the land to the sea, giving rise to land breeze. Thus, the \nphenomenon of land breeze and sea breeze is mainly due to the \npressure differences over the land and the sea.\nIf we could measure the speed of the escaping air in Activity 6.5, \nwe would find that the speed of the air is higher if the pressure \ndifference is higher.\nI have read that high-speed \nwinds can blow off roofs.\nI wonder how?\n6.4 \u0007High-Speed Winds Result in Lowering \nof Air Pressure\nActivity 6.6: Let us observe\n\t\nz Take two balloons of the same size.\n\t\nz Inflate both balloons and tie strings to them.\n\t\nz Hang the two balloons from a stick, leaving a \ngap of 6–10 cm (Fig. 6.13).\n\t\nz Now, blow air into the narrow space between \nthe balloons.\n\t\nz What happens to the balloons? Note down \nyour observations.\n\t\nz Now blow harder and observe.\nWhen you blow between the two balloons, you observe that they \nmove towards each other. This happens because when you blow \nair between the balloons, a low pressure area is created between \nthem. The higher air pressure surrounding the balloon pushes \nthem towards each other. You must have observed that blowing \nharder increases the speed at which the balloons approach each \nother. What can you infer from this activity? We infer that high \nspeed winds are accompanied by a reduced air pressure.\nFig. 6.13: Blowing between two balloons\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nWhen high-speed winds blow over houses, \na low-pressure area is created over them, \nas high-speed winds are accompanied by a \nreduced pressure. Therefore, the air pressure \nabove the roofs of the houses is lower than the \npressure below them. If the pressure difference \nis large and the roofs are weak, they may be \nblown away, as shown in Fig. 6.14 a. That is \nwhy it is safer to keep doors and windows of \nthe houses open during storms with high-speed \nwinds. When the same wind moves over the \nroofs, and through the houses, the pressure \ndifference between inside of the houses and \nover the roofs is reduced to a large extent. This \nhelps prevent the roofs from being blown off as \nshown in Fig. 6.14 b.\nYou must have experienced that when \nhigh-speed winds blow during storms, they \nare sometimes accompanied by thunder and \nlightning. Let us learn more about them.\n6.5 Storms, Thunderstorms, and Lightning\nFig. 6.14: (b) Roof of a house intact\nFig. 6.14: (a) Roof of a house \nblown away\nHave you heard the sound of \nthunder and seen lightning \nduring the rainy season?\nYes, the sound of thunder \nis so frightening! Usually \nthere is heavy rainfall too.\nWhen land gets heated, the warm and moist air, being \nlighter, rises, thereby creating a low pressure area. Cooler \nair from the surrounding high-pressure areas flows to \ntake its place. This air, in turn, gets heated and rises. \nThis results in a continuous process of wind circulation. \nAs the rising air expands, it cools and moisture in it \ncondenses to form water droplets, creating clouds. \nThe water droplets merge to form heavier drops, \nwhich come down as rain, hail, or snow. The strong \nwinds accompanied by rain is called a storm. In hot, \nhumid, and tropical regions like India, storms are \nmore frequent. Under certain conditions, warm air \nrises to great heights that the low temperature there \nconverts water droplets into ice particles.\nStrong winds blowing upwards and downwards \n(Fig. 6.15) facilitate rubbing between water droplets \nFig. 6.15: Strong winds going \nup and down\nWarm air\nCool air\nChapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones\n Fig. 6.17: Safe position \nduring lightning\nand ice particles. You have learnt in the chapter \n‘Exploring Forces’ that when two objects are rubbed \nagainst each other, they get charged. In this case, strong \nwinds blowing upwards and downwards and rubbing \nagainst each other cause static electric charges to \ndevelop within the clouds.\nThe positively charged lighter ice particles move \nupwards and occupy the upper part of the clouds. The \nnegatively charged heavier water droplets occupy the \nlower part of the clouds. Thus, a charge separation \nwithin the cloud takes place. Also, when the negatively \ncharged lower part of the cloud moves closer to the \nground, it causes the ground and nearby objects, such as trees or \nbuildings, to become positively charged (Fig. 6.16).\nNormally, air acts as an electrical insulator and does not \nlet opposite charges meet. But when the build up of charges \nbecomes very large, the insulating property of air breaks down. \nA sudden flow of charges takes place, producing a bright flash of \nlight called lightning.\nLightning can occur as opposite charges collide within a cloud, \nbetween clouds, or between clouds and the ground. Lightning \nrapidly heats up the air around it, causing the air to expand and \nproduce a loud sound known as thunder. A storm accompanied \nby lightning and thunder is called a thunderstorm.\nA step further\nIsolated and localised thunderstorms can sometimes occur in various \nregions of India. These thunderstorms are known by various names \nsuch as Kalboishakhi in West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand and \nBordoisila in Assam. They occur before the arrival of the monsoon, \nthereby helping kharif crops to grow. In Kerala, Karnataka, and \nTamil Nadu, they are known as mango showers as they support the \nripening of mangoes. Local thunderstorms in Karnataka help in the \ngrowth of coffee plants.\nLightning can be dangerous! It can ignite fires, \ndamage buildings, and cause severe burns or death \nin humans and animals. We must take necessary \nprecautions and protect ourselves from lightning. \nDuring lightning, stay away from tall objects, find a \nlow-lying open area and crouch down, and minimise \ncontact with the ground. Do not lie down flat. Avoid \nusing an umbrella with a metallic rod. If you are in \nwater, get out of it. If you are inside a bus or a car, you \nare comparatively safer.\n Fig. 6.16: Lightning\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nEver heard of ...\nA lightning conductor is a \nmetallic rod installed along the \nwalls of buildings during their \nconstruction. One end of the \nrod is pointed. This end is kept \nhigher than the highest point of \nthe building (Fig. 6.18). The other \nend of the rod is buried deep in \nthe ground. The rod provides \neasy path for the transfer of \nelectric charges into the ground. \nLightning \nconductor\nFig. 6.18: A lightning conductor\n6.6 Cyclone\nCyclones are large storms that form over warm ocean waters. \nAs the ocean water gets heated, the warm and moist air above \nit rises. As the moist air rises, the water vapour condenses to \nform raindrops. We know that during evaporation, \nwater takes up heat to change into vapour. When \nthis water vapour condenses into raindrops, heat is \nreleased back into the atmosphere. This causes further \nwarming of the ascending air leading it to rise even \nfurther, creating an even lower pressure. Air from the \nsurrounding regions rushes in and it also starts rising. \nEarth’s rotation causes the moving air to spin (Fig. 6.19). \nThis cycle is repeated, resulting in the creation of a very \nlow-pressure area with high-speed winds revolving \naround it. This spinning system of clouds, winds, and \nrain is called a cyclone.\nIn a cyclone, the region of lowest \npressure is at the centre, known as the eye \nof the cyclone. At the eye of the cyclone, \nthe wind is calm, but the surrounding \nregion experiences strong winds and \nheavy rainfall. As a cyclone moves from the \nocean towards the land, it generates higher \nwind speeds compared to the wind speeds \nproduced by regular thunderstorms. Once \nthe cyclone reaches land, the source of \nmoist air is cut off and it gradually loses its \nstrength.\nFig. 6.19: Winds blowing from \nhigh pressure areas to low \npressure areas \nHigh \npressure \nLow\npressure \n994 mb\n996 mb\n998 mb\n1008 mb\nHigh \npressure \nFig. 6.20: A cyclone\nEye of cyclone\nChapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones\nEven as a cyclone loses its strength while travelling over land, \nit leaves behind a trail of destruction that can take months or even \nyears to repair. Cyclones can be extremely destructive. For example, \nthe Amphan cyclone in 2020 had peak wind speeds of 270 km/h. \nStrong winds during a cyclone  push ocean water towards the \nshore, creating a wall of water that can be as high as 3–12 metres. \nThis surge of water can flood coastal areas and even areas far \nfrom the sea. The heavy rainfall which accompanies a cyclone \nmay cause rivers to overflow and can also trigger landslides. \nSeawater that rushes inland can contaminate drinking water \nsources and damage farmland. The salt in seawater can make soil \nless fertile, affecting crops. Roads may get blocked due to fallen \ntrees and debris, making it difficult for help to reach the affected \nareas. Power outages can last for days, disrupting emergency \nservices and daily life. \nHow can we protect ourselves during cyclones? It is important \nto stay updated on weather reports and periodic alerts, and \nwarnings issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). \nThanks to the weather monitoring satellites, today we can \ntrack cyclones and predict their path, helping us reduce their \nimpact on life and property. Several national and international \norganisations work together to monitor cyclone-related disasters. \nIf you live in a cyclone-prone area, keep an emergency kit ready \nwith essential items. During a cyclone, quickly move to a nearby \ndesignated cyclone shelter.\nLet us wrap up!\nCool air rushes to occupy the low-pressure area.\nWarm air rises, creating a low-pressure area.\nWarm air rises, cools, and the water vapour condenses to \nform clouds.\nBigger water drops in the clouds fall to the ground as rain, \nhail, or snow.\nPositive and negative charges are created in the clouds by \nstrong winds blowing upwards and downwards.\nUnder certain weather conditions, storms may develop into \ncyclones.\nWhen positive and negative charges meet, they cause \nlightning. Lightning may occur within a cloud, between \nclouds, or between a cloud and the ground.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nKeep the curiosity alive\n1.\t Choose the correct statement.\n(i)\t Look at Fig. 6.21 carefully.

Where do these pebbles, \nstones, and sand come from? \nIn the mountains, rocks gradually break down due to erosion. \nRivers flowing through these regions carry along the eroded rock \npieces. As the rivers flow, they continue to break down the rocks \nfurther into pebbles, stones, sand; and transport large quantities \nof them to the plains.\nThe bigger rocks are eventually broken down into finer grains \nof sand and clay. Is this grain the smallest unit of a bigger rock \nor can these grains of sand and clay be broken down further? \nLet us find out!\n7.1 What Is Matter Composed of?\n \nActivity 7.1: Let us explore\n\t\nz Take a stick of chalk (Fig. 7.1a) and break it into two \npieces (Fig. 7.1b). \n\t\nz Continue breaking the chalk till it becomes difficult \nto break it further by hand.\n\t\nz Grind the small pieces of chalk thus obtained \n(Fig. 7.1c) using mortar and pestle.\n\t\nz Observe the fine powder of chalk with a magnifying \nglass (Fig. 7.1d).\n\t\nz What do you observe?\n\t\nz Each tiny grain you observe is still a speck of chalk.     \nIs every speck of this fine \nchalk powder still composed \nof \nthe \nsame \nsubstance, \nor has it changed into \nsomething else on breaking \nor grinding?\nRecall Curiosity, Grade 7 chapter ‘Changes Around \nUs: Physical and Chemical’— is grinding chalk a physical \nchange or a chemical change?

Let us imagine that this \nprocess of grinding continues. Eventually, we would reach a stage \nwhere the chalk particles cannot be broken down any further. \nThe tiny units obtained at this stage \nare the basic building blocks that the \nchalk was made up of. \nThis means that one whole piece of \nchalk was made up of a large number \nof smaller units. These units are called \nconstituent particles of chalk. A constituent particle is the basic \nunit that makes up a larger piece of a substance or material. Just \nlike chalk, the grains of sand and clay are not the smallest units \nof bigger rocks. These are also made up of a large number of \ntheir constituent particles.\nLet us explore further!\nRecall the dissolution of sugar into water to form a solution. \nWhat happens to sugar when it is dissolved in water?\nActivity 7.2: Let us perform\n\t\nz Fill a glass tumbler with \ndrinking water. \n\t\nz Put two teaspoons of sugar \ninto it.\n\t\nz Do not stir the water.

Does it taste sweet? \nSince the top layer of water tastes sweet after dissolving \nsugar, it must be present in the solution. Do you observe any \nsugar particles in the solution? \nSugar particles can no longer be observed but their \npresence can be sensed by taste. When sugar dissolves in \nwater, it breaks up into its constituent particles which cannot \nbe broken down further.

These particles \nare so small that they cannot be seen even through an ordinary \nmicroscope.\nBut, where did \nthe sugar go?\nThe tiny sugar particles separate and occupy the available \nspaces between the water particles. These spaces between the \nparticles are known as interparticle spaces. \nChalk and sugar can both \nbe broken down into their \nconstituent particles. But how \nare the constituent particles \nheld together to form the solid \npieces we see?\n7.2 What Decides Different States of Matter?\nThe constituent particles of matter are held together through \nforces which are attractive in nature. These forces are called \ninterparticle attractions. The strength of these attractions \ndepends on the nature of the substance and the interparticle \ndistance. Even a slight increase in the distance decreases the \ninterparticle forces drastically. The strength of these forces \nultimately decides the physical state of the substances.\nDo you know that since ancient times, people have been thinking \nabout how far things could be broken down and what is matter \nmade up of?\n\t\nAcharya Kanad, an ancient Indian philosopher, first spoke \nabout the idea of a Parmanu (atom). He believed that matter is \nmade up of tiny, indivisible eternal particles called Parmanu. \nThis idea was written in his work called Vaisheshika Sutras. \nOur scientific heritage\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nLet us explore how these attractions vary in different states.\n7.2.1 Solid state\nHow are constituent particles held together in solids?\nActivity 7.3 : Let us find out\n\t\nz Collect a few solid objects, such as a piece \nof iron or an iron nail, a piece of rock salt, \na stone, a piece of wood, a key, and a piece \nof aluminium (Fig. 7.3). \n\t\nz Observe their shapes and sizes.\n\t\nz Try hammering them.\n\t\nz In which of the above six objects do \nyou  think particles are strongly held \ntogether?\nYou must have noticed that all these \nobjects are solids. They have a definite shape \nand volume. This is due to the fact that in solids, the particles \nare tightly packed and the interparticle attractions are very \nstrong. These strong forces of attraction hold the particles in \nfixed positions, preventing them from moving freely (Fig. 7.4a). \nThe particles can only move to and fro about their \npositions (vibrate or oscillate) but cannot move \npast each other.\nWhen solids are heated, their particles vibrate \nmore vigorously (Fig. 7.4b). A stage is reached \nwhen these vibrations become so vigorous that the \nparticles start leaving their position. The interparticle forces of \nattraction get weakened and the solid gets converted into the \nliquid state (Fig. 7.4c). The temperature at which this happens is \nthe melting point of the solid. \nFig. 7.4: Magnified schematic pictures of melting of a solid\n(b) Particles with \nincreased vibrations\n(a) Solid\n(c) Liquid\nStone\nPiece of aluminium\nRock salt\nKey\nIron nail\nWooden block\nFig. 7.3: Some solid objects\nIn the solid state, \nis there any way \nto \nmove \nthese \nparticles apart? \nChapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become \na liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. \nGenerally, in a liquid state, particles are somewhat farther away \nfrom each other as compared to those in the solid state (ice is an \nexception—its particles are farther apart than those in water). \nSome solids have weak interparticle forces of attraction, so \ntheir melting points are low. While others have strong attractive \nforces and have high melting points.

So, we can say that the liquids do not \nhave a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are \nkept in. This happens because the particles of liquids are free to \nmove. In all three containers, the water level remains at 200 mL \nand no change in volume is observed. Hence, we can say that \nliquids have a definite volume. However, if a container is not \nclean, some water may stick to its walls, causing the water level \nin the next container to be slightly less than 200 mL after pouring.\nActivity 7.4 shows that the particles of liquids can \nmove freely, but only within a limited space. Therefore, \nwe can infer that liquids have no fixed shape but have \na fixed volume.\nLet us now compare interparticle forces of \nattraction in liquids and solids. Take some water in a \nshallow vessel and try to move your finger through it \n(Fig. 7.6).\nAre you able to move your finger through the water?\nFig. 7.6: Moving finger through water\nChapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter\nYou can move your finger through water without breaking \nor cutting it permanently, which cannot be done in the case of \nsolids. When you try this, you are temporarily displacing water. \nAs soon as you remove your finger, the position of the water is \nrestored. We can say that in liquids, the interparticle attractions \nare slightly weaker than in solids, but still strong enough to keep \nthe particles close together. \nRecall Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Temperature and Its \nMeasurement’, where you observed the temperature of boiling \nwater (liquid). When a liquid is heated, a stage comes when \nit starts boiling. The temperature at which a liquid boils and \nturns into vapour at atmospheric pressure is called its boiling \npoint. The movement of particles becomes so vigorous that they \nmove apart from each other, resulting \nin a decrease in the interparticle forces \nof attraction. Eventually, the constituent \nparticles can escape from the liquid state. \nThe liquid is converted into vapour or the \ngaseous state.\nAt the boiling point, the formation of vapour is very fast and \noccurs not only at the surface but also within the liquid. This \nprocess is observed as bubble formation in the liquid. However, \nvapour formation occurs at all temperatures, even below the \nboiling point, though slowly and only at the surface. This slower \nprocess is known as evaporation — about which you have learnt \nin  earlier grades.\n7.2.3 Gaseous state\nDo gases also have \na fixed volume?\nActivity 7.5: Let us investigate\n\t\nz Take two transparent gas jars or glass tumblers \nand mark them A and B. \n\t\nz Create some smoke by burning an incense stick. \n\t\nz Hold the Gas Jar A upside down over the smoke (Fig. 7.7a). \n\t\nz The gas jar should trap the smoke inside.\n\t\nz Turn it over and cover it with a glass plate (Fig. 7.7b).\n\t\nz Hold another Gas Jar B upside down and gently place it over \nthe glass plate covering the Gas Jar A.\nI have seen that spilled \nwater disappears after \nsome time, and it happens \nat any temperature!\nSafety first\nBe careful while burning \nan incense stick.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n\t\nz Remove the glass plate slowly \nand ensure that both gas jars \nare close enough and there is \nno gap for smoke to escape \n(Fig. 7.7c).\n\t\nz Observe how the smoke \nspreads inside the Gas Jar B. \n\t\nz The smoke fills the entire \nspace in the Gas Jar B, \nindicating that gases do not \nhave a fixed volume and tend \nto occupy the entire available \nspace (Fig. 7.7d). Like liquids, \nthey also acquire the shape \nof the vessel they are in.\nThis \nillustrates \nthat \nthe \nparticles in gases move freely in \nall directions and the interparticle \nattractions are negligible. As a \nresult, gases do not have a fixed \nshape or volume.\nIn this activity, smoke is used to \nrepresent the gaseous state. The tiny particles of smoke suspended \nin the air are constantly hit by invisible particles of gases, and their \nmovement helps us observe the motion of gas particles. \nThis activity can also be demonstrated by using iodine vapour \ninstead of smoke from incense sticks. \nIodine vapour can be obtained by \nplacing some solid iodine in a closed gas \njar for some time, as shown in Fig. 7.8. \nBoth liquids and gases flow and \ndo not retain a fixed shape.

This shows that the gas \nparticles have a lot of space between them in their natural state, \nand this space can be reduced by applying external pressure.\nIf you stop pushing the plunger, the gas particles spread, and \nthe plunger moves back to its original position.\nRepeat this activity using water and observe.\nYou would observe that water is practically incompressible.\nLet us perform another activity to learn about the interparticle \nspaces in liquids.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nActivity 7.7: Let us observe\n\t\nz Take a glass vessel, fill it about half with water, and mark the \nlevel of water A (Fig. 7.10a).\n\t\nz Add two teaspoons of sugar into it. \n\t\nz Mark the new water level on the glass vessel B  (Fig. 7.10b). \n\t\nz Stir the water with a glass rod to dissolve the sugar (Fig. 7.10c). \n\t\nz Predict whether the water level will increase or decrease \nwith respect to the mark B. \n\t\nz Mark this water level again as C (Fig. 7.10d). \nA\nC\nB\nSugar \ndissolved \nin water\n(d)\nGlass \nvessel\nWater\nWater\nSugar\nA\nB\nGlass rod\n      (a)\n    (b)\n (c)\nFig. 7.10: Variation in water levels\nA\nDissolving \nSugar  \nin water\nWhat difference do you observe in the water levels?\nYou will observe that initially, when sugar is added, the level \nof water increases, but after dissolution, it may decrease to some \nextent. Since the volume of the solution is less than the sum of \nthe volumes of water and sugar, it indicates that \nthere is some space between the water particles. \nThe particles of the dissolved substance occupy \nthese spaces (Fig. 7.11). \nRepeat the Activity 7.7 with some other soluble \nsolids, such as common salt or glucose, and \ninsoluble solids, like sand and stone pieces.\nWhat do you observe in each case? Do the sand \nparticles dissolve? Does the volume of water in \nthe vessel change after mixing, and why?\nSugar and sand are both \nsolids. Why does sugar \ndissolve in water but sand \ndoes not?\nFig. 7.11: Magnified schematic \npicture of distribution of sugar \nparticles in water\nSugar \nparticle \nWater \nparticle \nChapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter\nSand is a solid that does not dissolve \nin water. When added to water, the sand \nparticles settle down and occupy some \nspace in the container, causing the total \nvolume to increase.\nWhat do you think about the interparticle \nspacing in solids?\nYou learnt earlier that the constituent \nparticles in solids are held together by strong \nforces of attraction. So, these particles do \nnot move from one place to another and \nare closely packed. However, despite close \npacking, some space is left between the \nparticles as shown in Fig. 7.12a. You might \nassume that the space between particles is \nfilled with air, but this is not the case. They \ncontain nothing at all. Fig. 7.12 summarises \nthe packing of particles and the interparticle \nspacing in the three states of matter.\nA step further\nOften, we use the term ‘particle’ in different contexts. The meaning \nof this term changes with the context. For example, while talking \nabout air pollution, the term Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) \nis used. This term refers to the tiny dust particles suspended in air \nand not the constituent particles of matter which are extremely \nsmall as compared to the dust particles. In fact, even these tiny dust \nparticles are also made up of a very large number of constituent \nparticles, i.e, atoms and molecules. \n7.4 \u0007How Particles Move in Different States \nof Matter?\nLet us find out about the movement of particles in the three states \nof matter.\nActivity 7.8: Let us experiment \n\t\nz Take a glass tumbler containing \nwater and put a few grains of \npotassium permanganate into it.\n\t\nz What do you observe?\nFig. 7.12: Magnified schematic pictures of \ninterparticle spacing in the three states \nof matter \n(a) Solid\n(b) Liquid\n(c) Gas\nSafety first\nDo not touch potassium permanganate \nwith your hands.

First they pull out the \nparticles of potassium permanganate from its \ngrain, and later they hit these particles so that \nthey get spread throughout the liquid. In the case \nof many substances, the constituent particles \nare held together strongly that the water particles are unable to \npull these out. Such substances, like sand, are insoluble in water.\nThink like a scientist\nTry it yourself!\n\t\n\nTake three clean glass tumblers.\n\t\n\nPour hot water in one of them, water at room temperature in the \nsecond and ice-cold water in the third.\n\t\n\nDrop a small grain of potassium permanganate into each of them. \n\t\n\nWatch carefully and compare. What do you observe?\nWater particles move faster in hot water compared to water at \nroom temperature, and even slower in ice-cold water. As a result, \nthe potassium permanganate spreads the fastest in hot water, less \nquickly in water at room temperature, and the slowest in ice-cold \nwater. Hence, the movement of particles increases when heat is \nprovided.\nTry to depict it by drawing a diagram.\nHow can we demonstrate \nthe \nmovement \nof \ngas \nparticles that cannot be \nseen with the naked eye?\nActivity 7.9: Let us find out\n\t\nz Light an incense stick in one corner of the room (Fig. 7.14). \n\t\nz Wait for a few minutes and observe.\n\t\nz Do you notice the fragrance from a distance?\nGlass \ntumbler\nPotassium \npermanganate\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 7.13: (a) Streaks of pink colour \nspreading out; (b) Uniform pink colour in \nglass tumbler\nChapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter\nFig. 7.14: Burning of an incense stick\nWhen an incense stick is burnt in one corner of the room, \ninitially, the fragrance is felt only around the incense stick. Shortly, \nyou can smell the fragrance throughout the room. This happens \nbecause the particles of the fragrance spread, filling the entire \nroom. This shows that the particles of air are moving constantly. \nThe air particles hit the particles of the fragrance and help them \nspread throughout the room.\nOh! \nNow \nI \nknow \nwhy \nand how the fragrance of \nperfume reaches us.\nCan you share a few other real-life situations where you have \nexperienced the movement of gas particles?\nEver heard of ...\nThe particulate nature of matter \nplays a crucial role in many \neveryday processes. For example, \nwhen we wash clothes stained \nwith oil using soap, numerous \nsoap particles surround the oil \nparticles on the fabric. One end \nof the soap particle attaches to \nthe oil, and the other mixes with \nwater, thus helping lift the oil off \nand wash it away (Fig. 7.15).\nFig. 7.15: Particles of soap \nhelp in cleaning\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nBased on our learnings from the chapter, we can say that matter \nis made up of small particles which are held together by the force \nof attraction. The strength of attractive forces between particles \ndepends on the distance between them, which in turn depends \non their thermal (heat) energy. Thus, it is the thermal energy of \nthe particles that determines the physical state of matter. In the \nsolid state, the thermal energy of particles is low, so they remain \nclose to each other and experience strong interparticle attractive \nforces. This restricts their motion to only small vibrations.\nAt the melting point, the thermal energy is used to overcome \nthe attractive forces between particles, allowing the solid to \nchange into a liquid. At this stage, the particles can move away \nfrom their fixed positions. The interparticle distance increases \nslightly, reducing the strength of the attractive forces to a level \nthat allows the particles to move around, though still within a \nlimited space. In the gaseous state, the particles have enough \nenergy to overcome the forces of attraction between them and \nmove freely in all directions. You will learn more about these \nparticles that constitute matter in higher grades.\nLet us wrap up!\nParticle nature of the three states of matter–\nStates of Matter\nSolid\nLiquid\nGas\nInterparticle spacing\nminimum\nInterparticle spacing little\nmore than in solids \nInterparticle spacing\nmaximum \nPacking of particles \nare closely packed  \nParticles are a little \nloosely packed than in \nsolids\nParticles are free \nInterparticle attraction \nis maximum \nInterparticle attraction is\nslightly weaker than in solids \nInterparticle\nattraction is minimum \n(negligible) \nMovement of particles\nnegligible (only vibrations) \nMovement of particles\nrestricted to limited space \nMovement of particles in\nall the available space\nChapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter\nKeep the curiosity alive\n1.\t Choose the correct option. \nThe primary difference between solids and liquids is that the \nconstituent particles are:\n(i)\t closely packed in solids, while they are stationary in \nliquids. \n(ii)\t far apart in solids and have fixed position in liquids. \n(iii)\t always moving in solids and have fixed position in \nliquids.\n(iv)\t closely packed in solids and move past each other in \nliquids.\n2.\t Which of the following statements are true?

Look around! The staircase you use, the air you breathe, the \nwater in your bottle, the food in your lunch box, the clothes and \nshoes you wear, the book you read, the trees outside, the ball you \nplay with and even the stick you carry — all of these are examples \nof matter, which you have learnt in earlier grades. \nYou have also learnt that all these things are made up of tiny \nparticles. Most of the things around us are not made of just one \nsubstance; rather they are made up of two or more substances \nmixed together. Let us now understand how different substances \ncome together to form mixtures.\n8.1 What Are Mixtures?\nHave you ever wondered what makes \nyour poha (Fig. 8.1) so delicious or how \nto make the perfect sprout salad? While \nthese dishes may seem very different, they \nshare something in common—they are \nboth made by mixing several ingredients. \nWe observe the mixing of substances in \neveryday life. Sugar dissolved in water \nis also a mixture, and so are soups and \nlemonade. \nWhen two or more substances are \nmixed, where each substance retains \nits properties, it is called a mixture. \nThe individual substances that make up \na mixture are called its components. \nThe components of a mixture do not \nreact chemically with each other. In some \nmixtures, the components — like green \ngram, chickpeas, onion, and tomato \nin a sprout salad (Fig. 8.2), are easy to \nsee. Such mixtures, where the different \ncomponents are generally visible with the naked eye or with a \nmagnifying device, are non-uniform in nature. Can you identify \na few more examples of non-uniform mixtures around you?\nOn the other hand, some mixtures have components that \ncannot be seen separately even with the help of a microscope. \nFor example, sugar and water particles cannot be seen separately \nin their mixture. Such types of mixtures, where the components \nare evenly distributed and cannot be distinguished, are uniform \nin nature (Fig. 8.3). Can you list a few uniform mixtures?\nFig. 8.1: Poha\nFig. 8.2: Sprout salad\nFig. 8.3: Uniform mixture  \nof sugar and water\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nMishraloha was the name given to the mixture of two or more metals \nthat had properties distinct from its constituent metals. Ancient \nIndian texts, such as the Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Rasaratna \nSamucchaya, Rasa Jala Nidhi, etc., mention the use of alloys for \nmedicinal purposes. For example, Bronze, also known as Kamsya, is \nan alloy made up of Copper (Tamra, 4 parts) and Tin (Vanga, 1 part), \nwas used to improve digestion and boost immunity.\nOur scientific heritage\n8.1.1 Is air a mixture?\nIn Curiosity, Grade 6, you learnt about air and its composition in \nthe chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’. Is air a mixture? What kind of \nmixture is it? \nYou have learnt that air is a uniform mixture of mainly \nnitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapour. Out of \nthese, oxygen is required by most of the living beings to stay alive. \nIt also helps in combustion. Nitrogen, which constitutes about 78% \nof the air, does not take part in combustion. We also learnt that air \nhas water vapour in it. When warm air touches a cool surface, the \nwater vapour turns into liquid water, forming tiny droplets. Recall \nthe experiment where you tested the presence of carbon dioxide \nin the air that we exhale. Let us confirm the presence of carbon \ndioxide in the air.\nActivity 8.1: Let us experiment\n\t\nz Take a glass tumbler and fill it half with water.\n\t\nz Add a small amount of calcium oxide \n(quick lime) slowly to it.\n\t\nz What do you observe?\n\t\nz Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with \nwater to form calcium hydroxide and releases heat. \nSafety first\nPerform this step carefully.\nA step further\nDo you know that stainless steel is also a mixture? \nStainless steel contains iron, nickel, chromium, \nand a small amount of carbon. They are mixed \nso uniformly that the entire mixture appears \nthe same throughout and one cannot see the \nindividual substances. Such mixtures are known \nas alloys. Brass, a mixture of copper and zinc, \nand bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, are \nsome other examples of alloys (Fig. 8.4).\nFig. 8.4: Utensils made of \nstainless steel, brass, and bronze\nChapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures\n\t\nz Stir continuously to make a solution of calcium \nhydroxide.

It \nis done to separate the components of a mixture. The examples \ndiscussed were from everyday life, where separation is done \nto obtain the component of interest and other components are \ndiscarded. However, in science, the purpose of separating a \nmixture is to obtain pure substances.\n8.2 What Are Pure Substances?\nHave you ever noticed the word ‘pure’ written on the packs of \nsome consumables, such as milk, ghee, and spices (Fig. 8.7)? The \nword ‘pure’ has slightly different meanings in common usage \nand in science.\nIn common usage, ‘pure’ means unadulterated products. \nAdulteration is an illegal process of adding substances which \nare cheaper, or of a poor quality, to a product. This is usually \ndone to increase the quantity or reduce the manufacturing cost. \nHowever, it deteriorates the quality of the product. It can also \nmake the product hazardous to health. \n Fig. 8.7: Some \nconsumable items\nChapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures\nIn science, however, a pure substance is the one that has no \nother substance present in it. For a scientist, even these products \nthat look pure can be considered impure if they are made of \nmore than one substance.\nA pure substance is a kind of matter that cannot be separated \ninto other kinds of matter by any physical process. When a \nscientist says that something is pure, it means that the substance \nconsists of the same type of particles.\nA step further\nAccording to science, how would you classify milk, packed \nfruit juice, baking soda, sugar, and soil — as mixtures or pure \nsubstances?\n8.3 What Are the Types of Pure Substances?\nRecall the different states of water that you studied in Curiosity, \nGrade  6. What happened when water was cooled or heated? \nWe observed that on cooling water gets converted into ice, and \non boiling it gets converted into vapour. We can get back water \nup on heating ice or cooling water vapour. It shows that during \nthese processes, the particles of water remain the same. Now, let \nus perform another activity in which we pass electricity through \nwater and observe its effect. \nActivity 8.3: Let us experiment \n(Demonstration activity)\n(a) Test tubes filled with water\nTest tubes \nWater\nTest tube \nstand\n\t\nz Collect two small test tubes, a beaker or a glass \ntumbler, and a 9 V battery.\n\t\nz Fill 2/3rd of the beaker with water and add a few drops of \ndilute sulfuric acid to it. \n\t\nz Fill both the small test tubes completely with water taken \nfrom the beaker (Fig. 8.8a).\n\t\nz Place a 9 V battery inside the beaker (Fig. 8.8b). \n\t\nz Without spilling the water, carefully place the water-filled \ntest tubes on each of the terminals of the battery (Fig. 8.8c).\n(b) 9 V battery placed inside \nthe beaker containing water\nBeaker \nWater\n9 V \nbattery\nSafety first\nThis activity must be performed under the \nsupervision of the teacher.

In the \nother test tube, the flame of the burning candle will glow brighter, \nconfirming the presence of oxygen gas (Fig. 8.9b).\nFig. 8.9: Testing the nature of gas (a) hydrogen; (b) oxygen\n(a)\nPop sound\nTest tube\nWater\nTest tube \nstand\n(b)\nFlame glows \nbrighter\nWater\nCandle\nSafety first\nPerform gas testing with care.

Each element \nis made up of identical particles called atoms. These particles \nare different from the particles of any other element. Elements \nare substances that cannot be further broken down into simpler \nsubstances. They are the building blocks of all matter. Some other \nexamples of elements are gold, silver, sulfur, carbon, etc. \nThe atoms of most of the elements cannot exist \nindependently. Two or more such atoms combine and \nform a stable particle of that element called a molecule. \nFor example, two atoms of hydrogen combine to form \none molecule of hydrogen. Similarly, two atoms of oxygen \ncombine to form one molecule of oxygen (Fig. 8.10).\nA step further\nElements can be classified into metals and non-metals. \nYou have already studied that gold, silver, magnesium, iron, and \naluminium are metals, whereas carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, and \noxygen are non-metals. Isn't it interesting to know that some \nelements like silicon and boron have intermediate properties \nbetween those of metals and non-metals? They are called \nmetalloids, about which you will learn in higher grades. \n\t\n\nThe number of elements known at present is 118, and most of them exist \nin a solid state.\n\t\n\nEleven elements exist in a gaseous state at room temperature, all of \nwhich are non-metals like oxygen, helium, nitrogen, etc.\n\t\n\nOnly two elements are liquid at room temperature—mercury, which is a \nmetal and bromine, which is a non-metal. \n\t\n\nAlthough gallium and caesium are solid elements, they become liquid at \na temperature around 30 °C (303 K) and turn into liquid.\nA step further\nEver heard of ...\nWhen electric current is passed through water, it breaks down into \nhydrogen and oxygen. Is this a chemical change or a physical change? \nRecall Curiosity, Grade 7, chapter ‘Changes Around Us: Physical and \nChemical’.\nFig. 8.10: Depiction of \nmolecules of \n(a) hydrogen;  \n(b) oxygen \n(a)\n(b)\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n8.3.2 Compounds\nWhy cannot we separate hydrogen and oxygen present \nin water by physical means?\nIn water, the particles of hydrogen and oxygen are \nso tightly attached to each other that it is generally \nimpossible to separate them apart using physical \nmethods. That is why water is a compound. Compounds \nare formed when different elements combine in fixed \nratios to form something entirely new. \nThe properties of compounds are different \nfrom those of elements forming that \ncompound. The constituent elements of \na compound cannot be separated by any \nphysical method. From  Activity 8.3, we \nfind that molecules of water are made of two different elements: \nhydrogen and oxygen (Fig. 8.11), combined chemically in a fixed \nratio. The ratio of the number of atoms of hydrogen to oxygen in \nwater has been found to be 2:1.\nAre common salt and sugar elements or compounds? Let us \nfind out.\nSodium, a soft metal, and chlorine, a hazardous gas, combine \nto form a harmless yet taste-enhancing substance that is essential \nfor our lives. This substance is known as sodium chloride, which \nis made up of particles of sodium and chlorine in a 1:1 ratio. We \nlearnt that dissolved sodium chloride (common salt) may be \nseparated from water by the physical process of evaporation.\nIs it possible to separate sodium chloride into its elements by \nphysical processes? \nLet us now explore if we can separate the elements in sugar!\nActivity 8.4: Let us experiment\n\t\nz Put a teaspoon of sugar in a boiling tube. \n\t\nz Heat it gently as shown in Fig. 8.12a.\n\t\nz What do you observe?\nOh! \nThis \nis \nreally \nfascinating—hydrogen \nis \na fuel, oxygen supports \ncombustion, \nwhereas \nwater extinguishes fire.\nSafety first\nThis activity must be performed \nin the presence of a teacher.\nA step further\nMore than 45 different elements, like aluminium, copper, silicon, \ncobalt, lithium, gold, silver, etc., are used in manufacturing a mobile \nphone, including its screen, battery, and other components.\nA step further\nOxygen\nHydrogen \nFig. 8.11: Depiction of \nmolecules of water\nChapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures\nAs you heat the sugar, it turns brown \n(Fig. 8.12b). Later, it begins to char, i.e., it \nturns blackish (Fig. 8.12c). \nYou will find small droplets of water \ninside the boiling tube near its open end. \nWhere did this water come from? Was \nit in the dry sugar, or did it come by the \ncondensation of water vapour in the air?\nSince we are heating the tube, the \nwater must have come from the dry sugar \nand not from the air. Can you predict \nwhat is left behind? Charcoal (carbon) is \nleft behind in the boiling tube. You can \nscoop it out in a watch glass (Fig. 8.12c) \nand explore if it burns like coal.\nSugar decomposes on heating and \ngives carbon and water. As you know, \nwater consists of hydrogen and oxygen. \nHence, sugar cannot be an element. \nIt may be stated that sugar is a chemical \ncompound consisting of the elements \ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\nLet \nus \nexplore \nmore \nabout \ncompounds.\nActivity 8.5: Let us experiment \n(Demonstration activity)\nSafety First\nSafety first\nThis activity may be demonstrated under the supervision of the \nteacher.

Its components retain their properties, \nand their black and yellow coloured particles can be seen. \nOn bringing magnet near Sample A, the iron filings get attracted \ntowards the magnet. Hence, iron and sulfur can be separated.\nYou might have observed that in Sample A, iron in the mixture \nreacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form iron chloride and \nhydrogen gas. The gas is colourless, has no smell, and burns with \na ‘pop’ sound.\nThe reaction can be represented as —\nIron + Dilute Hydrochloric acid \n Iron chloride + Hydrogen gas\nSulfur on the other hand, is left as a yellow solid at the bottom \nof the test tube. This shows that sulfur does not react with \nhydrochloric acid.￼\nSample B: The black mass obtained in Sample B is iron sulfide. \nWe observe that the texture and the colour are the same throughout. \nIt is formed by heating the two elements, iron and sulfur. It is not \nattracted by a magnet. The new substance has completely different \nproperties, and iron and sulfur can no longer be separated. Hence, \nwe can say that a compound has been formed. Can you explain \nnow why the magnet has no effect on Sample B?\nAlso, Sample B, iron sulfide, reacts with dilute hydrochloric \nacid, to form iron chloride and hydrogen sulfide gas. The gas is \ncolourless and has a rotten egg-like odour. \nThe reaction can be represented as —\nSample A\nSample B\nIron sulfide + Dilute Hydrochloric acid \n Iron chloride + Hydrogen sulfide\n8.4 \u0007How Do We Use Elements, Compounds, \nand Mixtures?\nElements, compounds, and mixtures are all around us. The \nair we breathe is a mixture of gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and \ncarbon dioxide. Water, which is essential for life, is a compound \nChapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures\nmade of elements, hydrogen and oxygen. Elements like iron and \naluminium are used to construct bridges, buildings, and vehicles.\nUnderstanding these concepts is not just about recognising \nwhat surrounds us; it is also the key to innovation. For instance, \nchemists study how elements combine to create compounds, \nenabling them to invent life-saving medicines and vaccines to fight \ndiseases. This knowledge also helps in the creation of fertilisers \nthereby enhancing crop production that feeds the ever-increasing \nhuman population globally.\nEngineers and material scientists rely on their understanding of \ncompounds and mixtures to design materials with unique properties. \nFor example, they have developed alloys like stainless steel, which is \nstronger and more durable than pure iron. Wood, steel, and concrete, \nwhich are used as building materials, are all mixtures.\nYou learnt that various metals are obtained from minerals. \nLet us learn about these minerals.\nAn \nexample \nof \na \n‘wonder’ \nmaterial \ndeveloped by material scientists is graphene \naerogel. This is made from carbon and is \nsaid to be the lightest material on earth. It is \nso light that even grass can hold it (Fig. 8.21). \nIt is highly porous and therefore, has a high \nabsorbing capacity. For this reason, it can \npotentially be used as an environmental cleaner, for example, to \nclean up oil spills in both seas and on land. It is useful in fabricating \nenergy-saving devices and special coatings for buildings.\nFig. 8.21\nA step further\n8.5 What Are Minerals?\nMost rocks are a mixture of minerals, which can be \nviewed with the eyes, or by using a magnifying glass or \na microscope. Some of the minerals are called native \nminerals, which are pure elements and not compounds. \nThese can be metals, such as gold, silver, copper, etc., or \nnon-metals like sulfur, carbon, etc. \nMost of the minerals are compounds made up of more \nthan one element. Some common examples of minerals \ninclude quartz, calcite, mica, pyroxene, and olivine \n(Fig. 8.22). Many things that we use in our everyday life are \nmade up of minerals or elements extracted from minerals. \nFor example, cement is made from calcite, quartz, alumina, \nand iron oxide, which are minerals or are obtained from \nminerals. Talcum powder is made from the mineral talc.\nPyroxene\nOlivine\nTalc\nQuartz\nCalcite\nMica\nFig. 8.22: Some minerals\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nElements and compounds are the building blocks of \nmatter—everything that has mass and takes up space. They make \nthe materials we see and use every day. However, not everything \naround us is matter. Light, heat, electricity, and even thoughts \nand emotions are important parts of our world, but they are not \nmade of matter. Understanding what matter is—and what it is \nnot—helps us better understand the world around us.\nUse \nof \nelements, \ncompounds, \nand \nmixtures in Indian Art\nThe Dhokra art is an old craft from Bihar and \nOdisha that uses different metals to create \nbeautiful figures inspired by nature (Fig. 8.23). \nThe process begins with shaping a design in \nbeeswax. This wax model is covered with clay \nto make a mould. After the clay hardens, the \nwax is melted out, leaving a hollow space. This \nspace is then filled with molten brass or bronze \nwhich makes Dhokra art strong and gives it a \nshiny golden colour. The figures often show \nanimals, people, and nature, reflecting tribal \ncreativity and tradition.\nOur scientific heritage\nFig. 8.23: Dhokra art\nSnapshots  \n\t\n\nA mixture consists two or more substances mixed together.

ORS is used to treat dehydration by keeping \nyour body hydrated. You have learnt to prepare ORS at home in \nCuriosity, Grade 6. You may have wondered why every sip of \nyour homemade ORS tastes the same, no matter how much you \ndrink. Why does it not taste salty in one sip and sweet in another? \nThis is because when you add sugar and salt to water, they \nform a mixture in which the components are evenly distributed \nthroughout. \nCan you predict whether this mixture is uniform or \nnot (Fig. 9.1)? What happens when chalk powder is mixed \nwith water—does it form a uniform mixture? \nWhen salt and sugar are mixed with water, a uniform \nmixture is formed, whereas when chalk powder or sand, or \nsawdust is mixed with water, the components are not evenly \ndistributed. Such mixtures are known as non-uniform \nmixtures (Fig. 9.2a and 9.2b).\nLet us explore the science of mixing things together.\n9.1 What Are Solute, Solvent, and Solution?\nA uniform mixture, such as that of salt or sugar, and water, is \ncalled a solution. Whenever a solid is \nmixed with a liquid to form a solution, the \nsolid component is called the solute, and \nthe liquid component is called the solvent. \nThe solute dissolves in the solvent to form \na solution (Fig. 9.3).\nSolute + Solvent \n Solution\nWhen a solution is formed by mixing \ntwo liquids, it is not always clear which \nsubstance is dissolving the other. In such \ncases, the substance present in smaller \namount is called the solute, while the one \nin larger amount is called the solvent.\nWe \nknow \nair \nis \na \nmixture. \nWould \na \nmixture of gases also be \nconsidered a solution?\nJust as water can act as a solvent in liquid solutions, gases can \nalso form solution — with air being a common example.\nAir is a gaseous solution. Since nitrogen is present in the largest \namount in the air, it is considered as the solvent, while oxygen, \nargon, carbon dioxide, and other gases are considered as solutes.\nFig. 9.1: Mixture of \nsugar, salt, and water\nFig. 9.2: Mixture of (a) Sand and \nwater; (b) Sawdust and water\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nEver heard of ...\nThe Chashni (sugar syrup) of the Indian \nsweet Gulab jamun is made of a large amount \nof sugar (solid) dissolved in a small amount \nof water (liquid).

Observe how many spoons of salt you can add before it \nstops dissolving completely.\n\t\nz Record your observations in Table 9.1.\nAmount of salt taken  \n(teaspoon)\nObservation (salt dissolves/salt \ndoes not dissolve)\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nFour\n…\nTable 9.1: Dissolution of salt in water\nSome discussion points\n\t\nz How many spoons of salt were you able to dissolve before \nsome of it remained undissolved?\n\t\nz What does this indicate about the capacity of water to \ndissolve salt?\nWhat will happen if we \nkeep on adding more \nsalt in a given amount \nof water?\nChapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions\nYou might have observed that, initially, the salt completely \ndissolves in the water, forming a solution. After adding a few \nmore spoons of salt, a stage comes when the added salt does not \ndissolve completely and the undissolved salt settles at the bottom. \nThis indicates that the water can no longer dissolve any more salt \nbecause it has reached its limit. The solution in which more solute \ncan be dissolved at a given temperature, is called an unsaturated \nsolution (Fig. 9.5). However, when the solute stops dissolving and \nbegins to settle at the bottom, the solution is called a saturated \nsolution at that particular temperature (Fig. 9.6).\nThe amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution \n(or solvent) is termed as its concentration. Depending upon the \namount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution, it can be \ncalled a dilute solution (less amount of solute) or a concentrated \nsolution (more amount of solute). Dilute and concentrated are \nrelative terms. \nSo, one can say in Activity 9.1, the solution obtained by \ndissolving one spoon of salt is dilute as compared to that obtained \nby dissolving two or more spoons of salt. \nCan you now reflect — which solution is more concentrated; \n2 spoons of salt in 100 mL of water or 4 spoons of salt in 50 mL \nof water?\nFrom Activity 9.1, we can say that the maximum amount of \nsolute that dissolves in a fixed quantity of the solvent is called its \nsolubility. \nDoes temperature affect the solubility of a solute?\nLet us find out!\n9.2.1 How does temperature affect the solubility of a \nsolute?\nActivity 9.2: Let us experiment  \n(Demonstration activity)\n\t\nz Take about 50 mL of water in a glass beaker and measure its \ntemperature using a laboratory thermometer, say 20 °C.\n\t\nz Add a spoonful of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) \nto the water and stir until it dissolves. \nContinue adding small amounts of baking \nsoda while stirring, till some solid baking \nsoda is left undissolved at the bottom of \nthe beaker.\nSafety first\nBe careful while using the \nheating device.\nFig. 9.5: Unsaturated \nsolution\nFig. 9.6: Saturated \nsolution\nSolution\nUndissolved \nsalt\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n\t\nz Now, heat the contents to 50 °C while \nstirring (Fig. 9.7). \n\t\nz What happens to the undissolved baking \nsoda? \n\t\nz You will observe that it has dissolved.\n\t\nz Continue adding more baking soda while \nstirring at this temperature until some \nsolid baking soda remains undissolved.\n\t\nz Again, heat the contents further to 70 °C \nwhile continuing to stir. What do you \nobserve?\n\t\nz The undissolved baking soda dissolves.\n\t\nz What do you infer from this experiment? \nWater at 70 °C dissolves more baking soda \nthan water at 50 °C. The amount of baking \nsoda dissolved in water at 20 °C is even lesser. \nIt has been found that for most of \nthe substances, the solubility increases with an increase in \ntemperature. We can also say that a saturated solution at a \nparticular temperature behaves as an unsaturated solution if the \ntemperature is increased.\nOur scientific heritage\nWater has primarily been used as a solvent for the preparation of \nmedicinal formulations in Ayurveda, Siddha, and other traditional \nsystems of medicine in India. Additionally, drug formulations have \nbeen prepared using hydro-alcoholic extracts of the herbs.

Oxygen \ndissolves in water only to a small extent. Even though present \nin minute quantities, it is this dissolved oxygen that sustains \nall aquatic life, including plants, fishes, and other organisms.\nIs the mixture of gases in water a uniform or non-uniform \nmixture?\nIt is a uniform mixture because the gases \ndissolve evenly in water to form a solution.\nDoes temperature affect the solubility \nof gases in liquids also? If so, how?\nIt has been observed that the solubility \nof gases generally decreases as temperature \nincreases. More oxygen can dissolve in \ncold water, ensuring sufficient oxygen for \naquatic life (Fig. 9.8). On the other hand, \nwhen water warms up, the solubility of \noxygen decreases.\nNow I understand that the mixtures we use can be \nof two types—uniform and non-uniform. Uniform \nmixtures are called solutions, and their components \nare not visible separately. In non-uniform mixtures, \nthe components can be seen either with the naked \neye or with a magnifying device.\nI observed that in some non-uniform mixtures, such \nas sawdust in water, the sawdust floats, whereas \nin the mixture of sand and water, the sand sinks. \nI wonder why that happens?\nFig. 9.8: Aquatic species in water\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n9.4 Why Do Objects Float or Sink in Water?\nYou must have observed that some objects float while \nothers sink in water (Fig. 9.9). You may have noticed that, \nwhile washing rice, husk particles present in the rice float \non the surface of water while rice sinks to the bottom \nof the container. Why does this happen? If you add oil \nto water, it floats on water. Generally, it is believed that \nobjects that float in a liquid are lighter and others that \nsink are heavier than the liquid.\nA wooden stick and an iron rod may be of the same size, \nyet the iron rod feels much heavier. When we say that iron \nis heavier than wood, we are referring to a special property \nknown as density, which describes the heaviness of an object. \nNote\nHowever, the density of a substance is not the only factor that \ndecides whether it will float or sink in a particular liquid.\nLet us explore further.\n9.5 What Is Density?\nImagine a crowded bus where many people are packed \ntogether — this is an example of high density whereas, \nthe same bus with only a few people is an example of \nlow density. Similarly, a forest where trees grow close \nto each other is called a dense forest (Fig. 9.10a), but if \nthe trees are far apart (Fig. 9.10b), it is considered less \ndense.\nHow do scientists define density? \nLet us find out.\nWe have learnt that matter is anything that possesses \nmass and occupies space (volume). Density is defined \nas the mass present in a unit volume of that substance.\nThe density of a substance may be expressed \nmathematically using the formula:\nDensity = \nMass\nVolume\nThe density of a substance is independent of its shape or size. \nHowever, it is dependent on temperature and pressure. Pressure \nprimarily affects the density of gases, while its effect on solids \nand liquids is negligible.\nFig. 9.9: Some objects float \nwhile others sink in water\nFig. 9.10 (a): Dense forest\nFig. 9.10 (b): Less dense forest\nChapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions\n Fig. 9.11: Packed oil\nThink like a scientist \nHave you noticed that some packets of ghee or oil are \nlabelled with a volume of 1 litre but a weight of only say \n910 grams (Fig. 9.11)? What does this tell us about the \ndensity of the oil, and is it less or more than that of water?\nThe units in which density is expressed will depend upon the \nunits of mass and volume taken. As you have learnt, the SI units \nof mass and volume are kilogram (kg) and cubic metre (m3), \nrespectively. Therefore, the SI unit of density is kilogram per cubic \nmetre, abbreviated as kg/m3. In case of liquids, other units of density \nare also used for convenience, such as gram per millilitre, abbreviated \nas g/mL and gram per cubic centimetre, abbreviated as g/cm3. \nConversion factor for density \n1 kg/m3 = 1000 g/m3 = 1000 g/1000 L = 1 g/L = 1 g/1000 mL = \n1 g/1000 cm3\nThe mass of 1 mL of water is close to 1 g at room temperature. \nFor the measurement of the mass of water, we generally consider \nthe volume in mL and its mass in g. Hence, 10 mL of water would \nbe approximately 10 g. Similarly, 100 mL of water would be \napproximately 100 g.\nSuppose the mass of an aluminium block is 27 g and its volume \nis 10 cm3, its density is 2.7 g/cm3.\nFrom this, it can be said that aluminium is 2.7 times denser \nthan water. We express this fact by saying that the relative \ndensity of aluminium with respect to water is 2.7. It is a number \nwithout any units.\n=\nDensity of that substance\nDensity of water at that temperature\nRelative density of any substance \nwith respect to water\n9.5.1 Determination of density \nThe density of an object can be determined by measuring its \nmass and volume.\nHow to measure mass? \nYou learnt the term ‘mass’ in Curiosity, Grade 6. Mass is the \nquantity of matter present in any object. The instrument used to \nmeasure the mass of an object is known as a balance. You must \nhave seen various types of balances being used by shopkeepers. \nHere, we are using a digital weighing balance to measure the \nmass. You learnt in chapter ‘Exploring Forces’ that on Earth, \nweight and mass are closely related.\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\nYou may measure the mass by doing the following activity.\nActivity 9.3: Let us measure\n\t\nz Switch ON the digital weighing balance.\n\t\nz Observe the initial reading on the digital weighing \nbalance display. \n\t\nz It should show a zero reading. If not, then we must \nbring it to zero by pressing the tare or reset button \n(Fig. 9.12a).\n\t\nz Place a dry and clean watch glass or butter paper \non the pan.\n\t\nz Note the reading on the digital weighing balance.\n\t\nz Reset the digital weighing balance reading to zero \nby pressing the tare or reset button as shown in \nFig. 9.12b.\n\t\nz Now, carefully place the solid object, such as stone, \non the watch glass (Fig. 9.12c).\n\t\nz Note the reading displayed on the balance, which \ngives the mass of the stone, say 16.400 g.\n(You may use any other type of balance available in \nyour school.)\nFig. 9.12(a): Digital \nweighing balance\nDigital \nweighing \nbalance\nFig. 9.12(b): Tare the balance \nafter placing a watch glass\nWatch \nglass\nFig. 9.12(c): Weighing a solid \nobject on digital balance\nStone \nor solid \nobject\nNote\nThe mass of a liquid may be measured by replacing \nthe watch glass with a beaker and pouring the desired \namount of liquid into it.\nA step further\nAs mentioned in Chapter 5, the words ‘mass’ and \n‘weight’ are often used interchangeably in everyday \nlanguage. But they have different meanings in \nscience, which can sometimes cause confusion. \nMass is the quantity of matter present in an object \nor a substance. Its units are gram (g) and kilogram \n(kg). On the other hand, weight is the force by which \nthe Earth attracts an object or a substance towards \nitself, and it is measured in newtons (N). Most balances (except two-pan \nbalances like in Fig. 9.13) actually measure weight, but their scales are marked \nin mass units, so they show values in grams or kilograms (Fig. 9.12c).\nPan\nPan\nHook\nPointer\nFig. 9.13: Two-pan balance\nChapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions\nFig. 9.15: Measuring cylinders of different \ncapacities\nHow to measure volume?\nA tetra pack says it contains 200 mL buttermilk (chach) (Fig. 9.14). \nWhat does that mean?\nYou learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 that volume is the space \noccupied by an object. You also know that the SI unit of volume \nis cubic metres, written as m³. It is the volume of a cube whose \neach side is one metre in length. Volume of smaller objects is \nconveniently expressed in a decimetre cube (dm3) or centimetre \ncube (cm3). One centimetre cube is also written as one cc. Volume \nof liquids is expressed in litres (L) which is equivalent to 1 dm3. \nA commonly used submultiple of a litre is millilitre (mL) which is \nequivalent to 1 cm3.  \nOne of the common apparatuses used to \nmeasure the volume of liquids is a measuring \ncylinder. It is a narrow transparent cylindrical \ncontainer with one side open and the other side \nclosed as shown in Fig. 9.15. There are markings \non the transparent body of the cylinder that \nindicate the volume of liquid in the measuring \ncylinder. We can use it to measure the desired \namount of a liquid.\nMeasuring cylinders are available in different \nsizes to measure volume — 5 mL, 10 mL, 25 mL, \n50  mL, 100 mL, 250 mL, etc (Fig.  9.15). How \naccurately \ncan \nthese \nmeasuring \ncylinders \nmeasure?\nLet us find out!\nActivity 9.4: Let us observe and calculate\nIn Curiosity, Grade 6, chapter ‘Temperature and Its Measurement’, \nyou learnt how to use the thermometer and to find its smallest \nreading; you can do the same with a measuring cylinder. \nTake a measuring cylinder and observe it carefully. Note \ndown the following:\n\t\nz What is the maximum volume it can measure?\nNow look at the measuring cylinder (Fig. 9.16) carefully. The \ncylinder is marked as 100 mL; therefore, it can measure volume \nup to 100 mL.\nWhat is the smallest volume it can measure? Look at the \nmeasuring cylinder again.\n\t\nz How much is the volume difference indicated between the \ntwo bigger marks (for example, between 10 mL and 20 mL)?\nFig. 9.14: A pack of \nbuttermilk of 200 mL\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n\t\nz How many smaller divisions are there between the two \nbigger marks?\n\t\nz How much volume does one small division indicate?\nThe smallest volume that the measuring cylinder can read \nis__________.\nFor the measuring cylinder shown in \nFig. 9.16, the volume difference indicated \nbetween 10 mL and 20 mL, or between 40 mL \nand 50 mL, is 10 mL.\nThe number of divisions between these \nmarks is 10.\nSo, one small division can read 10 ÷ 10 = 1 mL.\nThat is, the smallest value that this measuring cylinder can \nread is 1 mL.\nThe smallest volume that a measuring cylinder can measure \ndepends on the capacity of the measuring cylinder. Usually it is \n0.1 mL in smaller measuring cylinders with a capacity of 10 mL \nor 25 mL, it is 1 mL in a 100 mL measuring cylinder, 2 mL in a \n250 mL measuring cylinder, and 5 mL in a 500 mL measuring \ncylinder. Suppose we want to take 70 mL of water. If we use a \n50 mL measuring cylinder, it would not be possible to measure \n70 mL of water in one step. First, we have to measure 50 mL water \nand then 20 mL. Measuring volume in more than one step is not \nconvenient. On the other hand, if a 250 mL or 500 mL measuring \ncylinder is used, the measurement can be done in one step but \nthe accuracy would be reduced as the smallest volume that these \nmeasuring cylinders can measure is greater than that of a 100 mL \nmeasuring cylinder. Hence, a 100 mL measuring cylinder is the \nbest choice for this measurement. \nActivity 9.5: Let us measure 50 mL of water \n\t\nz Place a clean, dry measuring cylinder on a flat surface. \n\t\nz Pour water slowly into the measuring cylinder up to the \nrequired mark, as shown in Fig. 9.17.\n\t\nz If required, adjust the level of water in the measuring \ncylinder by adding or removing a small amount of water \nusing a dropper.\n\t\nz On careful observation, you will notice that the water inside \nthe measuring cylinder forms a curved surface. This curved \nsurface is called the meniscus (Fig. 9.18).\n\t\nz Read the mark on the measuring cylinder that coincides with \nthe bottom of the meniscus for water or other colourless \nliquids.\nFig. 9.16: Measuring \ncylinder of 100 mL\nWhy are measuring cylinders \nalways designed narrow and \ntall instead of wider and \nshort like a beaker?\nChapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions\n\t\nz Make sure that the eyes are at level with the bottom of the \nmeniscus while noting the readings as shown in Fig. 9.18.\nFig. 9.17: Pouring water into \nthe measuring cylinder\nFig. 9.18: Measuring the reading \n\t\nz Once it reaches the required \nlevel—that is, 50 mL — \ntransfer this water to the \nrequired container.\nIn case of coloured liquids \nthe mark on the measuring \ncylinder should coincide with \nthe top of the meniscus!\nDetermining volume of solid objects with regular \nshapes \nActivity 9.6: Let us calculate\n\t\nz Collect various objects with a cuboid shapes, such as a \nnotebook, a shoe box, or a dice.\n\t\nz Measure the length (l), width (w), and height (h) of the objects \nusing a scale.

To calculate its density, the main challenge is to \nfind its volume.

These quantities can be used \nto calculate the density of the object or the substance.\nLet us calculate the density\nDensity can be calculated using the following formula:\n\t\n= 3.28 g/cm3\n Fig. 9.19: Level of \nwater in the measuring \ncylinder (a) Without \nobject; (b) With object\n= 16.400 g\n5 cm3\nDensity = \nMass\nVolume\nChapter 9 — The Amazing World of Solutes, Solvents, and Solutions\nLet us dig deeper! \nDid you know that our planet, Earth, is \ncomposed of several layers, such as crust, \nupper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and \ninner core, each with its particular range of \ndensity? The outermost layer, called the crust, \nis the lightest and the density of the different \nlayers increases as we move towards the \ncentre (Fig. 9.20). As one moves deeper into the \nEarth, both the pressure and the temperature \nrise significantly, making the materials heavier \nand more compact.\nEver heard of ...\nIn ancient times, before large ships \nwere invented, people used bamboo \nand wooden logs to travel across \nrivers and seas (Fig. 9.21). Bamboo \nwas used because it is light, hollow, \nand floats easily on water. People tied \nbamboo poles together to make rafts \nand small boats for fishing, trading, \nand crossing water bodies. Wooden \nlogs, especially from strong trees were \neither hollowed out to make boats or \nused as rafts. These simple boats, made from locally available materials, \nwere important for moving around and connecting different places. \nEven today, similar traditional boats made of bamboo or wood are used \nin some regions—not just for transport, but also as tourist attractions.\nFig. 9.21: Bamboo raft floats \non water\n9.5.2 Effect of temperature on density\nGenerally, the density of a substance decreases with heating and \nincreases with cooling. This can be explained on the basis of \nwhat you have learnt in chapter ‘Particulate \nNature of Matter’. As temperature increases, \nthe particles of a substance whether, solid, \nliquid, or gas, tend to move away and \nspread. This results in an increase in volume \nbut there is no change in mass. Since the \nDensity = Mass/Volume, upon heating, the \nvolume increases and the density decreases. \nThis explains why hot air moves up as it is less \ndense than the cool air around it. The hot air \nballoon works on the same principle (Fig. 9.22). \nFig. 9.20: Layers of Earth\nCrust\nUpper mantle\nLower mantle\nOuter core (liquid)\nInner core (solid)\nFig. 9.22: Rising of hot air balloons\nCuriosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8\n9.5.3 Effect of pressure on density\nPressure affects density differently depending on the state of \nmatter. For gases, increasing pressure causes the particles to \nmove closer together. As a result, the volume of the gas decreases \nand its density increases. In the case of liquids, pressure has a \nsmall effect because they are nearly incompressible. We have \nlearnt in chapter ‘Particulate Nature of Matter’ that the particles \nin solids are very close to each other. So, how is the density of \nsolids affected when pressure is applied? Solids are even less \naffected by pressure than liquids, and changes in their density \nare usually negligible.\nEver heard of ...\nWhy does ice float on water? \nIce floats on water because \nit is lighter than liquid water \n(Fig. 9.23). Water has a special \nproperty \nthat \nits \ndensity \nis highest at 4 °C. It means \nwater is heaviest at 4 °C. \nAs \nthe \ntemperature \ndrops, \nand water turns into ice at \n0 °C, it undergoes a change \nin \nstructure—the \nparticles \narrange themselves in a way that takes up more space. This process is \ncalled expansion. Because the same amount of water now occupies a \nlarger volume, its density decreases. As a result, ice becomes lighter \nthan liquid water and floats on its surface.\nThis is important for animals living in lakes and oceans because \nice floats, it forms a layer on top, keeping the water underneath warm \nenough for fish and other creatures to survive, even in extremely \ncold weather.\nFig. 9.23: Ice floats on water\nThink like a scientist \n\t\n\nTake a glass tumbler and fill it with tap water. \nCarefully place a raw whole egg into the water \nand observe what happens.
